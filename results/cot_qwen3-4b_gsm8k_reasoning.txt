Let's break this down step by step to find out **how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market**.

---

### **Step 1: Total eggs laid per day**
Janet’s ducks lay **16 eggs per day**.

---

### **Step 2: Eggs eaten for breakfast**
She eats **3 eggs for breakfast every morning**.

So, **3 eggs are used for breakfast**.

---

### **Step 3: Eggs used for muffins**
She bakes **muffins for her friends every day with 4 eggs**.

So, **4 eggs are used for muffins**.

---

### **Step 4: Total eggs used**
Eggs used = eggs for breakfast + eggs for muffins  
= 3 + 4 = **7 eggs**

---

### **Step 5: Eggs remaining for sale**
Eggs sold = total eggs - eggs used  
= 16 - 7 = **9 eggs**

---

### **Step 6: Money made from selling eggs**
She sells each egg for **$2**.

So, money made = 9 eggs × $2/egg = **$18**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.**
We are told:

- A **robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber**.
- It also takes **half that much white fiber**.

So, first, let's find out how much **white fiber** is needed:

$$
\text{White fiber} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ bolt}
$$

Now, add the blue and white fiber together to get the **total number of bolts**:

$$
\text{Total bolts} = 2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **3 bolts**.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much **profit** Josh made.

---

### Step 1: Total Cost of the House

Josh buys the house for **$80,000** and spends **$50,000** on repairs.

So, his **total cost** is:

$$
80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
$$

---

### Step 2: Value After Repairs

The repairs increased the value of the house by **150%**. That means the **value after repairs** is:

$$
\text{Original Value} + 150\% \text{ of Original Value}
$$

$$
= 80,000 + (1.5 \times 80,000) = 80,000 + 120,000 = 200,000
$$

So, the **value of the house after repairs is $200,000**.

---

### Step 3: Profit Calculation

Profit is calculated as:

$$
\text{Selling Price} - \text{Total Cost}
$$

Assuming Josh sells the house for its **increased value**, which is **$200,000**, then:

$$
\text{Profit} = 200,000 - 130,000 = 70,000
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{70,000}
$$

Josh made a **$70,000 profit**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Sprints per week**: James runs **3 sprints** each day, and he does this **3 times a week**.  
   So, total number of sprints in a week =  
   $ 3 \text{ sprints/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ sprints/week} $

2. **Distance per sprint**: Each sprint is **60 meters**.

3. **Total distance per week**:  
   $ 9 \text{ sprints/week} \times 60 \text{ meters/sprint} = 540 \text{ meters/week} $

### ✅ Final Answer: **540 meters**.
We are told that:

- Wendi feeds her chickens **three times a day**.
- Each feeding is **3 cups of feed**, so in total, she gives:
  $$
  3 \text{ meals/day} \times 3 \text{ cups/meal} = 9 \text{ cups/day}
  $$
- But we are also told:
  - In the **morning**, she gives **15 cups**.
  - In the **afternoon**, she gives **25 cups**.
- So the **total feed given in the morning and afternoon** is:
  $$
  15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups}
  $$
- Therefore, the **final meal (evening)** must be:
  $$
  9 \text{ cups/day} - 40 \text{ cups} = -31 \text{ cups}
  $$

Wait — this doesn’t make sense. That would mean she’s giving **negative** feed, which is impossible.

Let’s re-examine the question carefully.

---

### Step-by-step breakdown:

> "Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed... She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals."

So, **per chicken**, she gives **3 cups per day**.

She has **20 chickens**, so total daily feed needed is:
$$
20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups/day}
$$

Now, she gives:
- **Morning**: 15 cups
- **Afternoon**: 25 cups

So far, she has given:
$$
15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups}
$$

Therefore, the **final meal (evening)** must give:
$$
60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{20} \text{ cups}
$$

Wendi needs to give **20 cups** of feed in the final meal of the day.
We are told that:

- One glass costs **$5**.
- **Every second glass** costs **60% of the price**, which is **$5 × 0.6 = $3**.
- Kylar wants to buy **16 glasses**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the pricing pattern

The prices alternate between **$5** and **$3** for each glass.

So, the pattern of prices for 16 glasses is:

$$
5, 3, 5, 3, 5, 3, \dots
$$

This is a repeating pattern of two glasses: one at $5 and one at $3.

---

### Step 2: How many pairs of glasses are there?

Since there are 16 glasses, and the pattern repeats every 2 glasses:

$$
\frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ pairs}
$$

Each pair consists of:
- 1 glass at $5
- 1 glass at $3

So, the cost per pair is:

$$
5 + 3 = 8 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total cost for 8 pairs

$$
8 \text{ pairs} \times 8 \text{ dollars per pair} = 64 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{64}
$$

Kylar needs to pay **$64** for 16 glasses.
We are given the following information:

- **Seattle** has 20 sheep.
- **Charleston** has **4 times** as many sheep as Seattle.
- **Toulouse** has **twice** as many sheep as Charleston.

Let’s break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find how many sheep Charleston has

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.

$$
\text{Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ sheep}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many sheep Toulouse has

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

$$
\text{Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ sheep}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add up all the sheep

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Seattle} + \text{Charleston} + \text{Toulouse} = 20 + 80 + 160 = 260
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{260}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total File Size**
- The file is **200 GB** in size.

---

### **Step 2: Normal Download Speed**
- Carla downloads at **2 GB per minute** under normal conditions.

---

### **Step 3: When Does the Restart Happen?**
- The restart happens **40% of the way through the download**.
- 40% of 200 GB is:
  $$
  0.4 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}
  $$

So, before the restart, Carla has already downloaded **80 GB**.

---

### **Step 4: Time to Download 80 GB**
- At 2 GB/minute:
  $$
  \frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ minutes}
  $$

So, it takes **40 minutes** to download the first 80 GB.

---

### **Step 5: Restart and Update Takes 20 Minutes**
- After downloading 80 GB, a **restart takes 20 minutes**.

---

### **Step 6: Restarting from the Beginning**
- After the restart, Carla has to **start over**, so she has to download the **entire 200 GB** again.

- At 2 GB/minute:
  $$
  \frac{200}{2} = 100 \text{ minutes}
  $$

---

### **Step 7: Total Time to Download the File**
- Time before restart: **40 minutes**
- Restart time: **20 minutes**
- Time after restart: **100 minutes**

$$
\text{Total time} = 40 + 20 + 100 = \boxed{160 \text{ minutes}}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
It takes **160 minutes** to download the file.
Let's break down the problem step by step and calculate how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours he spends trying to get back.

---

### **Part 1: Driving Away from Home**

- **Time:** 3 hours  
- **Speed:** 60 mph  
- **Distance away from home:**  
  $$
  \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
  $$

So, after driving for 3 hours, John is **180 miles away from home**.

---

### **Part 2: Driving Back Home (Trying to Get Home in 4 Hours)**

He tries to get home in **4 hours**, but the journey is not smooth. Let’s break this into parts:

#### **First 2 hours: Standstill Traffic**
- **Speed:** 0 mph  
- **Distance covered:**  
  $$
  0 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 0 \, \text{miles}
  $$

#### **Next 0.5 hours (30 mph):**
- **Speed:** 30 mph  
- **Distance covered:**  
  $$
  30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
  $$

#### **Remaining time:**
- Total time spent trying to get home: **4 hours**  
- Time already used: 2 + 0.5 = **2.5 hours**  
- Remaining time:  
  $$
  4 - 2.5 = 1.5 \, \text{hours}
  $$

- **Speed:** 80 mph  
- **Distance covered:**  
  $$
  80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  $$

---

### **Total Distance Covered While Trying to Get Home:**
$$
0 + 15 + 120 = 135 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### **Final Position Relative to Home:**

- He was **180 miles away** from home when he started driving back.
- He managed to drive **135 miles** back toward home.
- So, the distance from home at the end is:
$$
180 - 135 = \boxed{45} \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### ✅ **Answer: John is 45 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.**
Let's break down Eliza's earnings step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the pay structure**

- **Regular pay**: $10 per hour for the **first 40 hours**.
- **Overtime pay**: 1.2 times her regular rate for any hours **beyond 40**.

So, if she works **more than 40 hours**, the first 40 hours are paid at $10/hour, and the extra hours are paid at $10 × 1.2 = **$12/hour**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how many hours are regular and how many are overtime**

Eliza worked **45 hours** this week.

- Regular hours: **40 hours**
- Overtime hours: **45 - 40 = 5 hours**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate earnings**

- **Regular pay**:  
  $ 40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400 $

- **Overtime pay**:  
  $ 5 \text{ hours} \times \$12/\text{hour} = \$60 $

---

### **Step 4: Total earnings**

$$
\$400 + \$60 = \boxed{\$460}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **\$460**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **First Month:**
- The program had **60 downloads**.

---

### **Second Month:**
- The number of downloads was **three times** the first month.
- So, second month downloads = $ 3 \times 60 = 180 $

---

### **Third Month:**
- The number of downloads was **reduced by 30%** from the second month.
- A 30% reduction means the program had **70%** of the second month's downloads.
- So, third month downloads = $ 70\% \times 180 = 0.7 \times 180 = 126 $

---

### **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
$$
60 + 180 + 126 = 366
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 366 downloads** in total over the three months.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find the **total cost** of the pastries Toula bought.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of donuts
- **3 dozen donuts**
- **Cost per dozen:** $68

$$
\text{Cost of donuts} = 3 \times 68 = 204
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of mini cupcakes
- **2 dozen mini cupcakes**
- **Cost per dozen:** $80

$$
\text{Cost of cupcakes} = 2 \times 80 = 160
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of mini cheesecakes
- **6 dozen mini cheesecakes**
- **Cost per dozen:** $55

$$
\text{Cost of cheesecakes} = 6 \times 55 = 330
$$

---

### Step 4: Add up all the costs

$$
\text{Total cost} = 204 + 160 + 330 = 694
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The total cost is $694.**
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many years it will take for Carlos to **start earning money** from the lemon tree.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Cost**
- The **cost to plant** the tree is **$90**.

So, Carlos has to spend **$90 upfront** before he can start earning anything.

---

### **Step 2: Annual Income and Expenses**

Each year, the tree produces **7 lemons**, and each lemon sells for **$1.50**.

So, the **annual income** from the tree is:

$$
7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.50 = \$10.50
$$

But there’s also an **annual cost of $3** to water and feed the tree.

So, the **net profit per year** is:

$$
\$10.50 - \$3 = \$7.50
$$

---

### **Step 3: When Does He Start Earning Money?**

Carlos starts with a **$90 initial cost**.

He earns **$7.50 per year** after that.

We want to find out how many full years it takes for the **total earnings to exceed the initial cost**.

Let’s set up an equation:

$$
\text{Total earnings after } x \text{ years} = 7.50x
$$

We want:

$$
7.50x > 90
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
x > \frac{90}{7.50} = 12
$$

So, after **12 years**, he will have earned **$90**, which equals the initial cost.

But since we are looking for when he **starts earning money**, we need to check if he **earns more than the initial cost** at some point.

At the end of **12 years**, he has made exactly **$90**, which covers the initial cost.

So, after **12 years**, he has **broken even**.

To **start earning money**, he must have **earned more than $90**.

So, let’s check at **year 13**:

$$
7.50 \times 13 = 97.50
$$

That’s **$7.50 more than the initial cost**.

So, after **13 years**, he is **earning money** (i.e., making a profit).

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**It will take 13 years before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree.**
We are told that Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman and sold vacuum cleaners at three different houses:

- She sold **a third** of her vacuum cleaners at the **green house**.
- Then she sold **2 more** to the **red house**.
- Then she sold **half of what was left** at the **orange house**.
- After all this, she has **5 vacuum cleaners left**.

We need to find out how many vacuum cleaners she **started with**.

---

### Let’s define:

Let the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with be:  
**x**

---

### Step 1: Green House

She sold **a third** of her total at the green house.  
So she sold:  
$$
\frac{1}{3}x
$$

Remaining after green house:
$$
x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x
$$

---

### Step 2: Red House

She sold **2 more** at the red house.  
So she sold:  
$$
2
$$

Remaining after red house:
$$
\frac{2}{3}x - 2
$$

---

### Step 3: Orange House

She sold **half of what was left** at the orange house.

So she sold:
$$
\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2}{3}x - 2\right)
$$

Remaining after orange house:
$$
\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2}{3}x - 2\right)
$$

And we're told that after this, she has **5 vacuum cleaners left**.

---

### Set up the equation:

$$
\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{2}{3}x - 2\right) = 5
$$

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

$$
\frac{2}{3}x - 2 = 10
$$

Add 2 to both sides:

$$
\frac{2}{3}x = 12
$$

Now solve for x:

$$
x = 12 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Melanie started with **18 vacuum cleaners**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Total number of students:
- There are **20 students** in the dance class.

---

### Step 1: Contemporary Dance Enrollments

- **20%** of the students enrolled in **contemporary dance**.
- So, the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance is:

$$
0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ students}
$$

---

### Step 2: Jazz Dance Enrollments

- **25% of the remaining students** enrolled in jazz dance.
- The remaining students after contemporary is:

$$
20 - 4 = 16 \text{ students}
$$

- So, **25% of 16** enrolled in jazz dance:

$$
0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ students}
$$

---

### Step 3: Hip-Hop Dance Enrollments

- The rest of the students enrolled in **hip-hop dance**.
- Total students so far: 4 (contemporary) + 4 (jazz) = **8 students**
- Remaining students:

$$
20 - 8 = 12 \text{ students}
$$

So, **12 students** enrolled in hip-hop dance.

---

### Step 4: Percentage of Students in Hip-Hop Dance

To find the percentage:

$$
\frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**60%** of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
Let's break this down step by step to determine which purchase plan will result in the **maximum profit** for the merchant at the end of the month.

---

### Step 1: Understand the options

The merchant has two choices:

- **Option A**: Buy **jewelry worth $5,000**
- **Option B**: Buy **electronic gadgets worth $8,000**

The financial advisor predicts that:

- The **jewelry market will go up by 2.5%**
- The **electronics market will go up by 1.2%**

We assume that the **value of the item increases by the given percentage**, and the merchant wants to **maximize profit** at the end of the month.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the expected value of each option after the increase

#### Option A: Jewelry
- Initial cost: $5,000
- Market increase: 2.5%
- New value = $5,000 × (1 + 0.025) = $5,000 × 1.025 = **$5,125**

#### Option B: Electronic gadgets
- Initial cost: $8,000
- Market increase: 1.2%
- New value = $8,000 × (1 + 0.012) = $8,000 × 1.012 = **$8,096**

---

### Step 3: Determine the profit from each option

Assuming the merchant sells the item at the new value (after the market increase), the **profit** is:

#### Option A:
- Profit = New value - Cost = $5,125 - $5,000 = **$125**

#### Option B:
- Profit = New value - Cost = $8,096 - $8,000 = **$96**

---

### Step 4: Compare profits

- **Jewelry profit**: $125  
- **Electronics profit**: $96

So, the **jewelry** option gives a **higher profit**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

The merchant should choose the **jewelry** option to maximize profit, and the **maximum profit** would be **$125**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Problem Summary:**

- Two trains leave **San Rafael** at the same time.
- They first travel **westward** for **80 miles**.
- The next day, they travel **northward** for **150 miles**.
- We are to find the **total distance covered by each train over the two days**.

---

### **Step 1: Distance traveled westward**

Both trains travel **80 miles west** on the first day.

So, **distance west = 80 miles**

---

### **Step 2: Distance traveled northward**

The next day, both trains travel **150 miles north**.

So, **distance north = 150 miles**

---

### **Step 3: Total distance covered by each train**

Now, we add the two distances:

$$
\text{Total distance} = \text{West} + \text{North} = 80 + 150 = 230 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Each train covers a total of **230 miles** in the two days.
Sure! Let's calculate Jill's **annual salary** step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate her **weekly earnings** from teaching

- **Hourly rate as a teacher**: $20/hour  
- **Hours per week as a teacher**: 35 hours  

$$
\text{Weekly teaching income} = 20 \times 35 = 700 \, \text{dollars}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate her **weekly earnings** from cheerleading

- **Hourly rate as a coach**: $30/hour  
- **Hours per week as a coach**: 15 hours  

$$
\text{Weekly coaching income} = 30 \times 15 = 450 \, \text{dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total **weekly income**

$$
\text{Total weekly income} = 700 + 450 = 1150 \, \text{dollars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Annual income (assuming 50 weeks per year)

$$
\text{Annual salary} = 1150 \times 50 = 57,500 \, \text{dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Jill's annual salary is $57,500.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many eggs Claire uses per day
Claire makes **1 omelet** every morning, and each omelet uses **3 eggs**.

So, she uses:
$$
3 \text{ eggs/day}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find out how many days are in 4 weeks
There are **7 days in a week**, so in 4 weeks:
$$
4 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ days}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate total number of eggs used in 4 weeks
$$
3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ eggs}
$$

---

### Step 4: Convert eggs to dozens
There are **12 eggs in a dozen**, so:
$$
\frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{7} \text{ dozen eggs}
$$
We are given that Marissa is hiking a **12-mile trail** and wants her **average speed to be 4 miles per hour**. We need to determine the **speed she must walk the remaining distance** to achieve this average speed.

---

### Step 1: Understand what "average speed" means

Average speed is defined as:

$$
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
$$

Marissa wants her **average speed** to be **4 mph**, so we can write:

$$
4 = \frac{12}{\text{Total Time}}
$$

Solving for total time:

$$
\text{Total Time} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

So, Marissa must complete the entire 12-mile hike in **3 hours**.

---

### Step 2: Find out how much time she has already used

- She walked **4 miles** in **1 hour**
- Then she walked **2 miles** in **1 hour**

So far, she has used:

$$
1 + 1 = 2 \text{ hours}
$$

That leaves:

$$
3 - 2 = 1 \text{ hour}
$$

to complete the remaining part of the trail.

---

### Step 3: Determine the remaining distance

She has already hiked:

$$
4 + 2 = 6 \text{ miles}
$$

So the remaining distance is:

$$
12 - 6 = 6 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 4: Calculate the required speed for the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6}{1} = 6 \text{ mph}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{6} \text{ miles per hour}
$$

Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles at **6 mph** to have an average speed of 4 mph for the entire 12-mile trail.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the original amounts

- **Orange drink**: 10 liters  
  - It is **two-thirds water**, so:
    $$
    \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
    $$
  - The rest is **orange juice**:
    $$
    \text{Orange juice in orange drink} = 10 - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \approx 3.33 \text{ liters}
    $$

- **Pineapple drink**: 15 liters  
  - It is **three-fifths water**, so:
    $$
    \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters}
    $$
  - The rest is **pineapple juice**:
    $$
    \text{Pineapple juice in pineapple drink} = 15 - 9 = 6 \text{ liters}
    $$

### Step 2: You spill one liter of the orange drink

So, you start with 10 liters of orange drink, but you **spill 1 liter**, leaving:

$$
\text{Remaining orange drink} = 10 - 1 = 9 \text{ liters}
$$

Now, you pour the **remaining 9 liters of orange drink** into the **15 liters of pineapple drink**.

So the total volume after mixing is:

$$
9 + 15 = 24 \text{ liters}
$$

(As stated in the question.)

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water in the final mixture

From earlier:

- Water in **orange drink**: $ \frac{20}{3} $ liters (from 10 liters)
- But we only used **9 liters** of orange drink, not 10, so we need to adjust that.

Since the orange drink is **two-thirds water**, then in **9 liters** of it:

$$
\text{Water from orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ liters}
$$

And the **pineapple drink** has **9 liters of water**.

So the **total water** in the final 24-liter mixture is:

$$
6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{15} \text{ liters of water}
$$
Let's break down the information step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationships

- **Raymond and Samantha are cousins.**
- **Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.**
- **Raymond had a son at the age of 23.**
- **Samantha is now 31 years old.**

We are asked: **How many years ago was Raymond's son born?**

---

### Step 2: Find Raymond’s current age

Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is currently 31:

$$
\text{Raymond's current age} = 31 + 6 = 37 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find out when Raymond had his son

Raymond had a son when he was 23. So, the son was born:

$$
23 \text{ years ago}
$$

But we need to find **how many years ago** the son was born **from now**, not from when Raymond was 23.

So, we need to know how many years have passed since Raymond was 23.

---

### Step 4: Calculate the time between Raymond being 23 and now

Raymond is now 37, so:

$$
37 - 23 = 14 \text{ years}
$$

That means **14 years have passed since Raymond was 23**.

So, the son was born **14 years ago**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{14}
$$

**14 years ago** was when Raymond's son was born.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday.

---

### Step 1: Total number of customers
Billy has **8 customers** on Tuesday.

---

### Step 2: Break down the customers by how many DVDs they bought

- **First 3 customers**: Each bought **1 DVD**  
  So, total from these 3 = $ 3 \times 1 = 3 $ DVDs

- **Next 2 customers**: Each bought **2 DVDs**  
  So, total from these 2 = $ 2 \times 2 = 4 $ DVDs

- **Last 3 customers**: None bought any DVDs  
  So, total from these 3 = $ 3 \times 0 = 0 $ DVDs

---

### Step 3: Add up all the DVDs sold

$$
3 + 4 + 0 = 7
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Billy sold **7 DVDs** on Tuesday.
We are told that a candle melts by **2 centimeters every hour** that it burns.

We need to find how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from **1:00 PM to 5:00 PM**.

---

### Step 1: Find the total time the candle is burning

From **1:00 PM to 5:00 PM** is:

$$
5:00 - 1:00 = 4 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of melting

The candle melts **2 cm per hour**, so over 4 hours:

$$
2 \, \text{cm/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 8 \, \text{cm}
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{8} \text{ centimeters}
$$

So, the candle will be **8 centimeters shorter** after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
We are told that Kyle bought the book for **$19.50**, which is **25% off** the original price.

This means that **$19.50 is 75% of the original price** (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let’s call the original price **P**.

So, we can write the equation:

$$
0.75 \times P = 19.50
$$

Now solve for **P**:

$$
P = \frac{19.50}{0.75}
$$

$$
P = 26
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: The original price of the book was **$26.00**.
We are given the following information about Marie's purchases:

- **1 chicken meal** costing **$12**

- **Some boxes of pizza**, each costing **$8.50**
- **Total paid**: **$50**

We need to find how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the chicken meal
$$
\text{Chicken meal} = 1 \times 12 = 12 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the milk
$$
\text{Milk} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the apples
$$
\text{Apples} = 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add up the known costs
$$
\text{Total known cost} = 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 5: Subtract from total amount paid to find the cost of pizza
$$
\text{Cost of pizza} = 50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 6: Find how many boxes of pizza she bought
Each box of pizza costs **$8.50**, so:
$$
\text{Number of pizza boxes} = \frac{17}{8.50} = 2
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{2}
$$
Marie ordered **2 boxes of pizza**.
Let's calculate the total cost step by step.

Cynthia will spend **$16.00** on ice cream after 60 days.
We are told:

- Henry's **total trip** is **60 miles**.
- He made **two stops**:
  - First stop after **20 miles**.
  - Second stop was **15 miles before the end** of the trip.

We need to find how many miles he traveled **between his first and second stops**.

---

### Step 1: Find the position of the second stop

The second stop is **15 miles before the end** of the trip.

Since the total trip is 60 miles, the second stop is at:

$$
60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles}
$$

So, the second stop is at **45 miles**.

---

### Step 2: Find the distance between the first and second stops

First stop is at **20 miles**, second stop is at **45 miles**.

So, the distance between them is:

$$
45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{25} \text{ miles}
$$
We are given the following information:

- Gloria is choosing between **boots** and **two pairs of high heels**.
- The **two pairs of heels together cost $5 less** than the **boots**.
- One pair of heels costs **$33**.
- The other pair costs **twice as much** as the first.

---

### Step 1: Find the cost of the two pairs of heels

- First pair of heels = $33  
- Second pair of heels = 2 × $33 = $66

So, total cost of both pairs of heels =  
$$
33 + 66 = 99 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the relationship between the heels and the boots

We are told that the **heels cost $5 less** than the **boots**. So:

$$
\text{Cost of boots} = \text{Cost of heels} + 5
$$

$$
\text{Cost of boots} = 99 + 5 = 104
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{104}
$$

The boots cost **$104**.
We are given:

- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is **7:11**.
- Their **total age now is 162**.
- We need to find **Allen's age 10 years from now**.

---

### Step 1: Let the ages be in the ratio 7:11

Let:
- Darrell's current age = $7x$
- Allen's current age = $11x$

Then, their total age is:

$$
7x + 11x = 18x
$$

We are told that their total age is 162:

$$
18x = 162
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $x$

$$
x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
$$

---

### Step 3: Find Allen's current age

$$
\text{Allen's current age} = 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99
$$

---

### Step 4: Find Allen's age 10 years from now

$$
\text{Allen's age in 10 years} = 99 + 10 = \boxed{109}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **109**
Let's break this down step by step.

We are given three guesses about the number of jelly beans in a jar:

1. **First guess**: 80
2. **Second guess**: 20 more than half the first one
3. **Third guess**: 25% more than the first one

---

### Step 1: First guess is 80.

So,  
**Guess 1 = 80**

---

### Step 2: Second guess is "20 more than half the first one"

- Half of 80 = 40
- Add 20 → 40 + 20 = **60**

So,  
**Guess 2 = 60**

---

### Step 3: Third guess is "25% more than the first one"

- 25% of 80 = 0.25 × 80 = 20
- Add that to 80 → 80 + 20 = **100**

So,  
**Guess 3 = 100**

---

### Step 4: Find the average of the three guesses.

The three guesses are:  
80, 60, and 100

Average = (80 + 60 + 100) ÷ 3  
= 240 ÷ 3  
= **80**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **80**

1. **Number of dogs**: 10  
2. **Time per dog per day**: 0.5 hours  
3. **Total time per day for all dogs**:  
   $$
   10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
   $$

4. **Number of days in a week**: 7  
5. **Total time per week**:  
   $$
   5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
   $$

**Answer: John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.**
We are given:

- Gretchen has **110 coins** in total.
- There are **30 more gold coins than silver coins**.

Let’s define variables:

- Let $ S $ be the number of **silver coins**.
- Then the number of **gold coins** is $ S + 30 $ (since there are 30 more gold coins).

Now, the total number of coins is:

$$
S + (S + 30) = 110
$$

Simplify:

$$
2S + 30 = 110
$$

Subtract 30 from both sides:

$$
2S = 80
$$

Divide by 2:

$$
S = 40
$$

So, the number of **silver coins** is 40.

Then the number of **gold coins** is:

$$
S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: Gretchen has **70 gold coins**.
We are given the following information:

1. **Raymond has 40 jewels.**
2. **Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.**
3. **Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.**

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find how many jewels Aaron has

We are told:

> Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.

Raymond has 40 jewels, so:

$$
\text{Half of Raymond's jewels} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
$$

Then:

$$
\text{Aaron's jewels} = 20 + 5 = 25
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many jewels Siobhan has

We are told:

> Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.

So:

$$
\text{Siobhan's jewels} = 25 - 2 = 23
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{23}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Points in the first 20 minutes
Mike scores **4 points** in the first 20 minutes.

---

### Step 2: Points in the second 20 minutes
He scores **25% more points** in the second 20 minutes than he did in the first.

To find 25% of 4:
$$
25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
$$

So, in the second 20 minutes, he scores:
$$
4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total points
Now, add the points from both halves:
$$
4 + 5 = 9 \text{ points}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{9}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days**

Terry eats **2 yogurts per day**.

$$
2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry buys**

The sale is **4 yogurts for $5.00**.

$$
60 \div 4 = 15 \text{ sets of 4 yogurts}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total cost**

Each set costs $5.00.

$$
15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Terry spends **\$75.00** on yogurt over 30 days.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Total money from selling lego sets

John has **13 lego sets**, and he sells each for **$15**.

So, total money from selling legos:

$$
13 \times 15 = 195 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 2: Total cost of video games

He buys **8 video games**, each costing **$20**.

So, total cost of video games:

$$
8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Money left after buying video games

He had $195 from selling the legos and spent $160 on video games. So, the money left is:

$$
195 - 160 = 35 \text{ dollars}
$$

But the problem says he **has $5 left**. That means **some of the lego sets were not sold**.

---

### Step 4: Let’s find out how many legos he actually sold

Let’s call the number of legos he **sold** = **x**

Then the money he got from selling them is:

$$
15x
$$

He spent $160 on video games and had $5 left, so:

$$
15x - 160 = 5
$$

Now solve for x:

$$
15x = 165 \\
x = 11
$$

So, John sold **11 lego sets**.

---

### Step 5: How many legos does he still have?

He originally had **13 legos**, and sold **11**.

So, the number of legos he still has is:

$$
13 - 11 = 2
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**John still has 2 lego sets.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- John runs **60 miles a week**.
- He runs **3 days a week**.
- On the **first day**, he runs **3 hours**.
- On the **other two days**, he runs **half as much** as the first day.

We are asked to find **how fast he runs**, which means we need to find his **speed in miles per hour**.

---

### **Step 1: Find how many hours he runs each day**

- First day: **3 hours**
- Other two days: **half as much** → $ \frac{1}{2} \times 3 = 1.5 $ hours per day

So, on the other two days, he runs **1.5 hours/day**.

---

### **Step 2: Total hours he runs in a week**

$$
\text{Total hours} = 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total distance run in a week is 60 miles**

So, he runs **60 miles in 6 hours**.

---

### **Step 4: Find his speed (miles per hour)**

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ mph}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.**
We are given the following information:

- Dana can **run** at a rate **four times faster** than she can **walk**.
- She can **skip** at a rate that is **half as fast** as she can **run**.
- She can **skip at 3 miles per hour**.
- She spends **one-third of the time running** and **two-thirds of the time walking**.
- Total time = **6 hours**.

---

### Step 1: Find Dana's running speed

She skips at 3 mph, and skipping is **half as fast** as running.

So:
$$
\text{Running speed} = 2 \times \text{Skipping speed} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ mph}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find Dana's walking speed

She runs **four times faster** than she walks.

Let her walking speed be $ w $. Then:
$$
\text{Running speed} = 4w = 6 \Rightarrow w = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ mph}
$$

---

### Step 3: Time spent running and walking

Total time = 6 hours.

- Time running = $ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 $ hours
- Time walking = $ \frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 $ hours

---

### Step 4: Distance traveled

- Distance running = $ 6 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 12 $ miles
- Distance walking = $ 1.5 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 6 $ miles

---

### Step 5: Total distance

$$
\text{Total distance} = 12 + 6 = \boxed{18} \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **18 miles**
Let's break this down step by step.

We are given:

1. **Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old.**
2. **Ben’s iPhone is two times older than Suzy’s iPhone.**
3. **Brandon’s iPhone is four times as old as Ben’s iPhone.**

---

### Step 1: Find the age of Ben’s iPhone

> "Ben’s iPhone is two times older than Suzy’s iPhone."

This is a bit tricky in English, but it usually means:

> **Ben’s iPhone is twice as old as Suzy’s iPhone.**

So:

$$
\text{Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone}
$$

Since Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old:

$$
\text{Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the age of Brandon’s iPhone

> "Brandon’s iPhone is four times as old as Ben’s iPhone."

So:

$$
\text{Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Ben's iPhone}
$$

We already found that Ben’s iPhone is 2 years old:

$$
\text{Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Brandon’s iPhone is 8 years old.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- **Dragon Perg** is on **Mount Farbo**, and can breathe fire **up to 1000 feet away**.
- **Polly** can throw a **gold javelin**:
  - Normally, she can throw it **400 feet**.
  - But **when holding the sapphire gemstone**, she can throw it **three times farther** than when not holding it.

We are asked:

> **If Polly is holding the sapphire gemstone, how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames (i.e., beyond 1000 feet) could she stand and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin?**

---

### **Step 1: Determine the distance Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone.**

- Without the gemstone: 400 feet
- With the gemstone: 3 × 400 = **1200 feet**

So, **with the gemstone**, Polly can throw the javelin **1200 feet**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine how far outside the dragon's reach this is.**

- Dragon’s flame range: **1000 feet**
- Polly can throw the javelin **1200 feet**
- So, she can go **1200 – 1000 = 100 feet** **outside** the dragon's reach and still hit it.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

**Polly can stand 100 feet outside the dragon's reach and still hit it with the gold javelin when holding the sapphire gemstone.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of pie pieces**

Grandma Jones baked **5 apple pies**, and each pie was cut into **8 pieces**.

So, total number of pieces is:

$$
5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Pieces remaining at the end**

At the end of the evening, **14 pieces** of pie were left.

---

### **Step 3: Pieces taken by guests**

To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

$$
40 \text{ total pieces} - 14 \text{ remaining pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces taken}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{26}
$$

So, **26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many calories are left in your daily target**

- Your daily calorie target is **2000 calories**.
- You've already consumed **1800 calories**.
- So, the number of **calories you can still consume** is:

$$
2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find out how many calories are in one serving of chips**

- The bag has **250 calories per serving**.

---

### **Step 3: Determine how many servings you can eat with 200 calories left**

$$
\frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories per serving}} = 0.8 \text{ servings}
$$

So, you can eat **0.8 servings** of chips.

---

### **Step 4: Find out how much that is in grams**

- The entire **300g bag** has **5 servings**.
- So, each **serving** is:

$$
\frac{300 \text{ g}}{5} = 60 \text{ g per serving}
$$

- Therefore, **0.8 servings** would be:

$$
0.8 \times 60 = 48 \text{ grams}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: You can eat 48 grams of chips.**
Let's break this down step by step to find Charlie's **net profit** if he makes and sells **20 candles**.

---

### **Step 1: How many pounds of beeswax does he need to make 20 candles?**

- For every **1 pound of beeswax**, he can make **10 tapered candles**.
- So, to make **20 candles**, he needs:

$$
\frac{20 \text{ candles}}{10 \text{ candles per pound}} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
$$

---

### **Step 2: What is the cost of the beeswax and supplies?**

- **1 pound of beeswax + wicks = $10.00**
- He uses **2 pounds** of beeswax and wicks, so the total cost is:

$$
2 \times \$10.00 = \$20.00
$$

---

### **Step 3: How much revenue does he get from selling 20 candles?**

- Each candle is sold for **$2.00**
- He sells **20 candles**, so total revenue is:

$$
20 \times \$2.00 = \$40.00
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate net profit**

$$
\text{Net Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost}
$$
$$
\text{Net Profit} = \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \boxed{\$20.00}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: His net profit is $\boxed{\$20.00}$.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

- **Monday**: Meredith wrote **5 articles**.
- **Tuesday**: She wrote **2/5 times more articles than on Monday**.

To find how many articles she wrote on Tuesday:

$$
\text{Articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \left( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 \right) = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
$$

- **Wednesday**: She wrote **twice the number of articles as on Tuesday**.

$$
\text{Articles on Wednesday} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Total number of articles over three days**

$$
\text{Total articles} = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \text{ articles}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Time per article**

Each article takes an average of **4 hours** to research and write.

$$
\text{Total time} = 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{104} \text{ hours}
$$

Meredith spent **104 hours** writing articles over the three days.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial number of Post-it notes**

Candice started with **80** Post-it notes in her purse.

---

### **Step 2: She bought a package of Post-it notes**

Let’s call the number of Post-it notes in the package **x**.

So, after buying the package, she had:

$$
80 + x \text{ Post-it notes}
$$

---

### **Step 3: She used some Post-it notes at work**

She placed **1 Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee**, so she used:

$$
220 \text{ Post-it notes}
$$

---

### **Step 4: She had 23 Post-it notes left**

So, after using 220, she had 23 left. That means:

$$
(80 + x) - 220 = 23
$$

---

### **Step 5: Solve the equation**

$$
80 + x - 220 = 23
$$

$$
x - 140 = 23
$$

$$
x = 23 + 140 = 163
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{163}
$$

So, the package she purchased contained **163 Post-it notes**.
We are given the following information:

- John buys **twice as many red ties as blue ties**.
- The **red ties cost 50% more than blue ties**.
- He spent **$200 on blue ties**, and each blue tie costs **$40**.

---

### Step 1: Find how many blue ties he bought

He spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.

$$
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
$$

So, John bought **5 blue ties**.

---

### Step 2: Find how many red ties he bought

He bought **twice as many red ties as blue ties**.

$$
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the cost of a red tie

Red ties cost **50% more than blue ties**. Since blue ties cost $40:

$$
\text{Cost of red tie} = 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60
$$

---

### Step 4: Calculate total cost of red ties

$$
\text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
$$

---

### Step 5: Total amount spent on all ties

$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of blue ties} + \text{Cost of red ties} = 200 + 600 = \boxed{800}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$800**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Convert units to be consistent**

The total length of the wire is **4 feet**, and the pieces are **6 inches** long.

We need to convert **4 feet** into **inches** because the pieces are measured in inches.

- 1 foot = 12 inches  
- So, 4 feet = $ 4 \times 12 = 48 $ inches

---

### **Step 2: Divide total length by the length of each piece**

Now we divide the total length of the wire (in inches) by the length of each piece:

$$
\frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches per piece}} = 8
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**

Tracy obtained **8 pieces** of wire.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of units in the building**

- The building has **15 floors**.
- Each floor has **8 units**.

So, total units =  
$$
15 \text{ floors} \times 8 \text{ units per floor} = 120 \text{ units}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Number of occupied units**

- **3/4** of the building is occupied.

So, occupied units =  
$$
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Number of unoccupied units**

Total units = 120  
Occupied units = 90  
Unoccupied units =  
$$
120 - 90 = 30 \text{ units}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 30 unoccupied units**.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much Lloyd makes per week from selling eggs.

---

### **Step 1: Find out how many eggs he produces in a day.**

Lloyd's chickens produce **252 eggs per day**.

---

### **Step 2: Convert eggs to dozens (since eggs are sold by the dozen).**

There are **12 eggs in a dozen**, so:

$$
\frac{252 \text{ eggs}}{12} = 21 \text{ dozen}
$$

So, Lloyd sells **21 dozen eggs per day**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate daily earnings.**

He sells each dozen for **$2**, so:

$$
21 \text{ dozen} \times \$2 = \$42 \text{ per day}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate weekly earnings.**

There are **7 days in a week**, so:

$$
\$42 \text{ per day} \times 7 = \$294 \text{ per week}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Lloyd makes $294 per week from selling eggs.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the distance traveled**

Tom is sailing from **1 PM to 4 PM**, which is a total of:

$$
4 \text{ PM} - 1 \text{ PM} = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

He is traveling at **10 miles per hour**, so the distance he covers is:

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the time to return**

Now Tom is returning at a speed of **6 mph**, and the distance is still **30 miles**.

To find the time it takes to return, use the formula:

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

It takes Tom **5 hours** to get back.
We are told that Uriah needs to **remove 15 pounds** from his book bag. He has two types of items:

- **Comic books**: Each weighs **1/4 pound**
- **Toys**: Each weighs **1/2 pound**

He removes **30 comic books**, and we need to find out how many **toys** he must remove to make the total weight removed equal to **15 pounds**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the weight of the comic books

Each comic book is **1/4 pound**, and he removes **30** of them:

$$
\text{Weight of comics} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how much more weight needs to be removed

He needs to remove a total of **15 pounds**, so the remaining weight to remove from toys is:

$$
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find how many toys weigh 7.5 pounds

Each toy is **1/2 pound**, so the number of toys needed is:

$$
\frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Uriah needs to remove **15 toys**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the charges**

- **Truck tire repair:** $60 per tire  
- **Car tire repair:** $40 per tire

---

### **Step 2: Calculate revenue for each day**

#### **Thursday:**
- 6 truck tires repaired:  
  $ 6 \times 60 = 360 $ dollars  
- 4 car tires repaired:  
  $ 4 \times 40 = 160 $ dollars  
- **Total revenue on Thursday:**  
  $ 360 + 160 = 520 $ dollars

#### **Friday:**
- 12 car tires repaired:  
  $ 12 \times 40 = 480 $ dollars  
- No truck tires repaired.  
- **Total revenue on Friday:**  
  $ 480 $ dollars

---

### **Step 3: Compare the two days**

- Revenue on **Thursday**: $520  
- Revenue on **Friday**: $480  

So, **Thursday** had higher revenue.

---

### **Step 4: Find how much more revenue was earned on the higher-revenue day**

$$
520 - 480 = 40
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

The mechanic earned **$40 more** on the day with higher revenue (Thursday).
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information

- The **Doubtfire sisters** are driving home with **7 kittens** that they adopted from the shelter.
- Their **mother calls** to say:
  - **Patchy**, one of their house cats, has had **thrice the number of adopted kittens**.
  - **Trixie**, the other house cat, has had **12 kittens**.

We are to find out **how many kittens the Doubtfire family now has** in total.

---

### Step 2: Define variables

Let’s define:

- Let $ x $ be the number of **adopted kittens** that Patchy has had.
- Then, according to the problem, **Trixie** has had **12 kittens**.
- Also, it says **Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens**. That means:

$$
\text{Patchy's kittens} = 3x
$$

So, Patchy has had $ 3x $ kittens.

---

### Step 3: Total number of kittens

The family currently has:

- **7 kittens** that they **adopted** from the shelter.
- Plus the **kittens born to their house cats**:
  - Patchy has had $ 3x $ kittens.
  - Trixie has had 12 kittens.

So total number of kittens is:

$$
\text{Total kittens} = 7 + 3x + 12 = 19 + 3x
$$

But we need a specific number — so we must determine the value of $ x $.

---

### Step 4: Interpret "Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens"

This part is key and can be interpreted in two ways:

#### Option 1 (Most likely interpretation):

"Patchy has had **thrice the number of adopted kittens**" → This could mean that Patchy has had **three times as many kittens as the 7 adopted ones**.

So:

$$
\text{Patchy's kittens} = 3 \times 7 = 21
$$

Then Trixie has 12 kittens.

So total kittens = 7 (adopted) + 21 (Patchy) + 12 (Trixie) = **40 kittens**

---

### Step 5: Final Answer

$$
\boxed{40}
$$

So, the **Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Start with the total number of lollipops**

Jean has **30 lollipops**.

---

### **Step 2: Subtract the lollipops Jean eats**

Jean eats **2 lollipops**, so:

$$
30 - 2 = 28 \text{ lollipops remaining}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Package 2 lollipops per bag**

Now, Jean wants to package the remaining **28 lollipops** into bags, with **2 lollipops per bag**.

To find how many bags she can fill:

$$
\frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ bags}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{14} \text{ bags}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the total cost per movie trip

- **Movie ticket:** $7  
- **Popcorn:** $7  

So, the total cost for one movie visit is:

$$
7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 2: Divide Peter’s total money by the cost per trip

Peter has **$42**.

To find out how many times he can go to the movies, divide:

$$
42 \div 14 = 3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Peter can go to the movies **3 times** with $42.
We are given the following information:

- **Bridge weight limit**: 5000 pounds  
- **Weight of each box**: 15 pounds  
- **Weight of driver and empty truck**: 3755 pounds  

We are to find the **maximum number of boxes** that can be loaded onto the truck **without exceeding the bridge's weight limit**.

---

### Step 1: Determine how much more weight the bridge can carry

The bridge can carry up to **5000 pounds**. The **driver and empty truck** already weigh **3755 pounds**.

So, the remaining weight capacity is:

$$
5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many boxes can be loaded

Each box weighs **15 pounds**, so the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded without exceeding the weight limit is:

$$
\left\lfloor \frac{1245}{15} \right\rfloor
$$

Now calculate:

$$
\frac{1245}{15} = 83
$$

Since 83 × 15 = 1245, which is exactly the remaining capacity, we can load **83 boxes**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{83}
$$

So, the **maximum number of boxes** that can be loaded is **83**.
Let's break this down step by step to find the **final price of Stephen's groceries** after all the fees and charges.

---

### Step 1: Understand the original total

Stephen's **original order** (before any fees) was:

$$
\text{Original total} = \$40.00
$$

---

### Step 2: Apply the 25% fee

The delivery vendor added a **25% fee** on the original total.

$$
\text{Fee} = 25\% \times 40.00 = 0.25 \times 40.00 = \$10.00
$$

So, the **total after the 25% fee** is:

$$
40.00 + 10.00 = \$50.00
$$

---

### Step 3: Add the delivery fee

They also charged a **$3.00 delivery fee**, so we add that:

$$
50.00 + 3.00 = \$53.00
$$

---

### Step 4: Add the tip

Stephen added a **$4.00 tip**, so we add that as well:

$$
53.00 + 4.00 = \$57.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\$57.00}
$$

This is the **final price Stephen paid** after all the fees and charges.
We are given:

- The raspberry bush has **6 clusters**, each containing **20 fruit**.
- There are also **67 individual fruits** scattered across the bush.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the number of fruits in the clusters

Each cluster has 20 fruits, and there are 6 clusters:

$$
6 \text{ clusters} \times 20 \text{ fruits per cluster} = 120 \text{ fruits}
$$

---

### Step 2: Add the individual fruits

There are 67 individual fruits:

$$
120 \text{ (from clusters)} + 67 \text{ (individual)} = 187 \text{ raspberries}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{187}
$$
We are given the following information about a basket of 25 oranges:

- **Total oranges** = 25  
- **1 is bad**  
- **20% are unripe**  
- **2 are sour**  
- The rest are **good**

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of unripe oranges

20% of 25 oranges are unripe:

$$
20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
$$

So, **5 oranges are unripe**.

---

### Step 2: List all categories and count them

We now know:

- Bad: 1 orange  
- Unripe: 5 oranges  
- Sour: 2 oranges  

Now, let's add these up:

$$
1 + 5 + 2 = 8
$$

So, **8 oranges** are either bad, unripe, or sour.

---

### Step 3: Subtract from total to find the number of good oranges

Total oranges = 25  
Oranges that are not good = 8

$$
\text{Good oranges} = 25 - 8 = 17
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{17}
$$

So, **17 oranges are good**.
Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Cost of materials**: $500  
2. **Cost of construction by the jeweler**: $800  
3. **Insurance cost**: 10% of the total of the first two costs.

First, calculate the total of the first two costs:  
$$
500 + 800 = 1300
$$

Next, calculate 10% of that amount for insurance:  
$$
10\% \text{ of } 1300 = 0.10 \times 1300 = 130
$$

Now, add all the costs together:  
$$
500 + 800 + 130 = 1430
$$

### Final Answer: **$1430**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Given:
- **If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years**, she gets an **annual pension of $50,000/year**.
- **Starting after 20 years**, she becomes entitled to **5% of the value of the pension per year**.
- She **quits after 30 years**.

We are asked: **What will her annual pension be if she quits after 30 years?**

---

### Step 1: Understand the pension structure

There are two key points:

1. **After 20 years**, she becomes entitled to **5% of the value of the pension per year**.
2. The **maximum pension** (if she stays for 40 years) is **$50,000/year**.

So, we can assume that the **pension increases linearly** with time, or that the **base pension amount is based on a formula**.

But the key clue is:

> "Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year."

This suggests that **after 20 years**, she is entitled to **5% of the full pension** — which would be:

$$
\text{Pension after 20 years} = 5\% \times 50,000 = 0.05 \times 50,000 = 2,500
$$

So, **after 20 years**, she gets **$2,500/year**.

But wait — this seems very low. Let’s re-examine the wording:

> "Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year."

That could mean:

- After 20 years, she is **entitled to 5% of the value of the pension** (i.e., 5% of the **full pension**), which is **$2,500/year**.

Alternatively, it could mean that **after 20 years**, she is entitled to **5% of the pension she would have received at retirement**.

But since the maximum pension is **$50,000/year** at 40 years, and she only worked **30 years**, we need to find out what **her pension would be at 30 years**.

---

### Step 2: Determine the pension at 30 years

We are told:

- If she works for **40 years**, she gets **$50,000/year**.
- So, the **maximum pension** is **$50,000/year** at 40 years.

Assuming that the pension is **linear** (i.e., it increases evenly over time), then:

$$
\text{Pension at } t \text{ years} = \frac{t}{40} \times 50,000
$$

So, at **30 years**:

$$
\text{Pension} = \frac{30}{40} \times 50,000 = 0.75 \times 50,000 = 37,500
$$

So, **at 30 years**, her pension would be **$37,500/year**.

---

### Step 3: Apply the 5% rule

Now, the problem says:

> "Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year."

This likely means that **after 20 years**, she is entitled to **5% of the full pension** (i.e., 5% of $50,000), which is **$2,500/year**.

But that would imply that **after 20 years**, her pension is **$2,500/year**, not $37,500.

This seems contradictory. So we must interpret this carefully.

---

### Alternative Interpretation:

Maybe the **5% is applied to the pension she would have received at retirement**, but **not at the time she quits**.

That is:

- At **30 years**, she is entitled to **5% of the pension she would receive at 40 years**.

So:

$$
\text{Pension at 30 years} = 5\% \times 50,000 = 2,500
$$

This would be the **annual pension** she receives **after 30 years**.

So, the answer is:

$$
\boxed{2500}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Her annual pension after quitting after 30 years will be $2,500/year.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- Monthly charge = $140
- The year is divided into two halves:
  - **First half of the year**: Charged **$140 per month**
  - **Second half of the year**: Charged **10% less** than $140 per month

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the monthly charge for the second half**

A 10% decrease on $140:

$$
10\% \text{ of } 140 = 0.10 \times 140 = 14
$$

So, the new monthly charge is:

$$
140 - 14 = 126
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total charges for each half of the year**

- **First half (6 months)**:
  $$
  6 \times 140 = 840
  $$

- **Second half (6 months)**:
  $$
  6 \times 126 = 756
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Add both halves to get the total amount paid**

$$
840 + 756 = 1596
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{1596}
$$

Aleena paid a total of **$1596** for the streaming service by the end of the year.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the information given**

- Sophia has traveled **100 miles** since last filling her tank.
- She added **4 gallons** of gas to fill the tank.
- The car’s **tank holds 12 gallons** of gas.

---

### **Step 2: Find the car's fuel efficiency (miles per gallon)**

We know that she drove **100 miles** using **4 gallons** of gas.

So, the fuel efficiency is:

$$
\text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{\text{Miles driven}}{\text{Gallons used}} = \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how far she can go on a full tank**

The tank holds **12 gallons**, and the car gets **25 miles per gallon**.

$$
\text{Total miles on a full tank} = 25 \times 12 = 300 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Sophia can drive **300 miles** on a single tank of gas.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Time spent watching TV in one session

Jim spends **2 hours** watching TV.

---

### Step 2: Time spent reading in one session

He reads for **half as long** as he watches TV.

So, time spent reading =  
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 \text{ hour}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total time per session (TV + reading)

$$
2 \text{ hours (TV)} + 1 \text{ hour (reading)} = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total time per week

He does this **3 times a week**, so:

$$
3 \text{ hours/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
$$

---

### Step 5: Total time over 4 weeks

$$
9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks.**

So, **2 teams per school**.

---

### **Step 2: Number of people per team**

Each team has:
- 5 **players**
- 1 **coach**

That’s **6 people per team**.

---

### **Step 3: Total per school**

Each school sends:
- 2 teams × 6 people/team = **12 people per school**

---

### **Step 4: Total for all 4 schools**

4 schools × 12 people/school = **48 people**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 48 people**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Number of Diamonds
We are told:

> There were **175 diamonds**.

So:
$$
\text{Diamonds} = 175
$$

---

### Step 2: Number of Rubies
We are told:

> There were **35 fewer rubies than diamonds**.

So:
$$
\text{Rubies} = \text{Diamonds} - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140
$$

---

### Step 3: Number of Emeralds
We are told:

> There were **twice the number of emeralds as rubies**.

So:
$$
\text{Emeralds} = 2 \times \text{Rubies} = 2 \times 140 = 280
$$

---

### Step 4: Total Number of Gems
Now, we add up all the gems:

$$
\text{Total gems} = \text{Diamonds} + \text{Rubies} + \text{Emeralds}
$$
$$
= 175 + 140 + 280 = 595
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{595}
$$
We are given the following information:

- There are **twice as many boys as girls** at Dr. Wertz's school.
- There are **60 girls**.
- There are **5 students per teacher**.

We are to find how many **teachers** there are.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of boys

It says there are **twice as many boys as girls**, and there are **60 girls**.

So, number of boys = $ 2 \times 60 = 120 $

---

### Step 2: Find the total number of students

Total students = boys + girls  
= $ 120 + 60 = 180 $

---

### Step 3: Find the number of teachers

There are **5 students per teacher**, so the number of teachers is:

$$
\frac{\text{Total students}}{\text{Students per teacher}} = \frac{180}{5} = 36
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{36}
$$
We are given:

- Bailey receives **$5 per week** for **8 weeks**.
- At the end of 8 weeks, she has a total of **$100**.
- We need to find out how much money she **started with**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total allowance received over 8 weeks

She gets $5 each week for 8 weeks:

$$
5 \times 8 = 40
$$

So, she received **$40** in total from her allowance.

---

### Step 2: Let the amount she started with be $ x $

At the end of 8 weeks, her total money is:

$$
x + 40 = 100
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = 100 - 40 = 60
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Bailey started with **$60**.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much money Judy makes in one week.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the number of classes per day**

- **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):** 5 days × 5 classes/day = **25 classes**
- **Saturday:** 8 classes

So, total classes in a week =  
**25 (weekdays) + 8 (Saturday) = 33 classes**

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the number of students per class**

Each class has **15 students**.

So, total number of students in a week =  
**33 classes × 15 students/class = 495 students**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the revenue per student**

Judy charges **$15.00 per student**.

Total revenue =  
**495 students × $15.00/student = $7,425**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

**Judy makes $7,425 in one week.**
Let's break this down step by step.

- **Cheesecakes**: $4 per slice

---

### Step 2: Find out how many slices were sold
- **Brownies sold**: 43 slices  
- **Cheesecakes sold**: 23 slices

---

### Step 3: Calculate total money from brownies
$$
43 \text{ brownies} \times \$3 = \$129
$$

---

### Step 4: Calculate total money from cheesecakes
$$
23 \text{ cheesecakes} \times \$4 = \$92
$$

---

### Step 5: Add both amounts to find total fundraising
$$
\$129 + \$92 = \$221
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Tommy raises \$221.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the phones**

Shiela bought **5 cell phones**, each costing **$150**.

$$
\text{Total cost of phones} = 5 \times 150 = 750
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the interest charged**

A **2% interest** is charged on **each unit** (each phone), not on the total. So we calculate the interest for **one phone** first.

$$
\text{Interest per phone} = 150 \times 0.02 = 3
$$

So, the **total interest** for all 5 phones:

$$
\text{Total interest} = 5 \times 3 = 15
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total amount to be paid**

$$
\text{Total amount} = \text{Cost of phones} + \text{Total interest} = 750 + 15 = 765
$$

---

### **Step 4: Divide the total amount into 3 equal monthly payments**

$$
\text{Monthly payment} = \frac{765}{3} = 255
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Round the prices to the nearest dollar**

- **Marigolds:** $2.74 → Rounded to **$3**
- **Petunias:** $1.87 → Rounded to **$2**
- **Begonias:** $2.12 → Rounded to **$2**

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the revenue from each type of flower**

- **Marigolds:** 12 pots × $3 = **$36**
- **Petunias:** 9 pots × $2 = **$18**
- **Begonias:** 17 pots × $2 = **$34**

---

### **Step 3: Add up the total revenue**

$$
\$36 + \$18 + \$34 = \boxed{\$88}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Artie will make $88.**
We are given:

- Luke builds a **4-level** sandcastle.
- The **top level (level 4)** has a square footage of **16**.
- Each level has **half the square footage** of the level below it.

We need to find the **average square footage** of all 4 levels.

---

### Step 1: Understand the pattern

Since each level has **half the square footage** of the one below it, the square footage decreases by a factor of 2 as we go down the levels.

Let’s denote the square footage of each level from **top to bottom** as:

- Level 4: 16 (given)
- Level 3: half of Level 4 = 16 / 2 = **8**
- Level 2: half of Level 3 = 8 / 2 = **4**
- Level 1: half of Level 2 = 4 / 2 = **2**

So the square footages are:

- Level 1: 2
- Level 2: 4
- Level 3: 8
- Level 4: 16

---

### Step 2: Calculate the average

To find the **average square footage**, add up the square footages and divide by the number of levels:

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{2 + 4 + 8 + 16}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{7.5}
$$

The **average square footage** of a level is **7.5**.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the feeding schedule**

- For the **first 180 days**, the puppy needs **1 cup of dog food per day**.
- After that, for the **rest of its life**, the puppy needs **2 cups per day**.
- But we are only concerned with the **first year**, which is **365 days**.

So, we need to calculate how much dog food is used in the **first 365 days**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the amount of food used in the first 180 days**

$$
\text{Food used in first 180 days} = 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the amount of food used in the remaining days of the year**

There are:

$$
365 - 180 = 185 \text{ days}
$$

In those 185 days, the puppy eats **2 cups per day**:

$$
\text{Food used in next 185 days} = 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total food used in the first year**

$$
\text{Total food} = 180 + 370 = 550 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Determine how many bags are needed**

Each bag contains **110 cups** of dog food.

$$
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{550}{110} = 5
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Cecilia will use **5 bags** of dog food in the first year.
We are given the following:

- Sarah does **400 pounds** of laundry.
- Raymond does **half as much** laundry as Sarah.
- Sarah does **4 times as much** laundry as David.

We are asked to find the **difference in the amount of laundry** that **Raymond and David** do.

---

### Step 1: Find how much Raymond does

Raymond does **half as much** as Sarah:

$$
\text{Raymond's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah's laundry} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how much David does

Sarah does **4 times** as much as David, so:

$$
\text{Sarah's laundry} = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \\
400 = 4 \times \text{David's laundry} \\
\text{David's laundry} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the difference between Raymond and David

$$
\text{Difference} = \text{Raymond's laundry} - \text{David's laundry} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{100} \text{ pounds}
$$
We are given:

- **Package of 3 flowers** costs **$2.50**
- **Package of 2 flowers** costs **$1.00**

Vincent wants to buy **18 flowers**, and we need to find out how much money he **saves** by choosing the **better price**.

---

### Step 1: Find the cost per flower for each package

- **Package of 3 flowers**:
  $$
  \frac{2.50}{3} \approx 0.8333 \text{ dollars per flower}
  $$

- **Package of 2 flowers**:
  $$
  \frac{1.00}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per flower}
  $$

So, the **package of 2 flowers** is cheaper per flower.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost using the better price (package of 2)

To get 18 flowers:

$$
\frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ packages}
$$

Each package costs $1.00, so:

$$
9 \times 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost using the other package (package of 3)

$$
\frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ packages}
$$

Each package costs $2.50, so:

$$
6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find the savings

$$
15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Vincent saves $6.00** by buying 18 flowers at the better price.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Original cost of grooming**: $100  
2. **Discount offered**: 30% off for being a new customer  
3. **Calculate the discount amount**:  
   $$
   30\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.30 \times 100 = 30
   $$  
4. **Subtract the discount from the original price**:  
   $$
   100 - 30 = 70
   $$

**Final answer**: The grooming cost is **$70**.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Total amount of water
The total amount of water is:

$$
24 \text{ liters}
$$

---

### Step 2: Water given to the two girls
Each girl got $ \frac{1}{6} $ of the 24 liters.

So, each girl got:

$$
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
$$

Since there are two girls, together they got:

$$
4 + 4 = 8 \text{ liters}
$$

---

### Step 3: Water given to the boy
The boy got:

$$
6 \text{ liters}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total water given out
Total water given out is:

$$
8 \text{ (girls)} + 6 \text{ (boy)} = 14 \text{ liters}
$$

---

### Step 5: Water left
Water left is:

$$
24 - 14 = 10 \text{ liters}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{10} \text{ liters}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

**Step 1: Start with the initial number of stickers.**

Charlie starts with **10 stickers**.

---

**Step 2: Add the stickers he bought from the store.**

He buys **21 stickers**, so:

$$
10 + 21 = 31 \text{ stickers}
$$

---

**Step 3: Add the stickers he got for his birthday.**

He gets **23 stickers** for his birthday, so:

$$
31 + 23 = 54 \text{ stickers}
$$

---

**Step 4: Subtract the stickers he gave to his sister.**

He gives **9 stickers** to his sister:

$$
54 - 9 = 45 \text{ stickers}
$$

---

**Step 5: Subtract the stickers he used to decorate a greeting card.**

He uses **28 stickers** to decorate a card:

$$
45 - 28 = 17 \text{ stickers}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **17 stickers** left.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find Grace's weight  
Grace weighs **125 pounds**.

---

### Step 2: Find Alex's weight  
Alex weighs **2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs**.

First, calculate 4 times Grace's weight:

$$
4 \times 125 = 500 \text{ pounds}
$$

Now subtract 2 pounds:

$$
500 - 2 = 498 \text{ pounds}
$$

So, **Alex weighs 498 pounds**.

---

### Step 3: Add their weights together  
Grace: 125 pounds  
Alex: 498 pounds  

$$
125 + 498 = 623 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Their combined weights are 623 pounds.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of rose bushes**: 3  
2. **Roses per bush**: 25  
   - So, total number of roses = $ 3 \times 25 = 75 $  
3. **Thorns per rose**: 8  
   - So, total number of thorns = $ 75 \times 8 = 600 $

**Answer: 600 thorns in total.**
We are told:

- A football team played **22 games** in total.
- They **won 8 more games than they lost**.

Let’s define the variables:

- Let $ L $ be the number of **losses**.
- Then the number of **wins** is $ L + 8 $ (since they won 8 more than they lost).

We also know that the total number of games is 22, so:

$$
\text{Losses} + \text{Wins} = 22
$$

Substitute the expressions for losses and wins:

$$
L + (L + 8) = 22
$$

Simplify:

$$
2L + 8 = 22
$$

Subtract 8 from both sides:

$$
2L = 14
$$

Divide by 2:

$$
L = 7
$$

So, the number of **losses** is 7, and the number of **wins** is:

$$
L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: The team won **15 games**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many years Gene has been vacationing**

- He has been vacationing **since he was 23**.
- He is now **34**.
- So, the number of years he has been vacationing is:

$$
34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many vacations he goes on each year**

- He goes on **4 vacations per year**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total number of quilt blocks**

- Each vacation gives him **1 quilt block**.
- So, total number of blocks is:

$$
11 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ blocks/year} = 44 \text{ blocks}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{44}
$$

Gene has **44 quilt blocks** in total.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are told:

- Greg has an **alarm that rings three times a day** as a reminder.
- When the alarm goes off, it **continues to ring until Greg turns it off**.
- The **first time** it went off today, it **rang four times**.
- The **second time** it went off, it **rang for three times as long as the first time**.
- The **third time**, it **rang for half as long as the second time**.

We are asked: **How many times did the alarm ring in all?**

---

### Step 1: Understand what is being asked

We are not being asked how many times the alarm **went off**, but how many times it **rung** in total during the three instances.

So we need to find the **total number of rings** from the three alarms.

---

### Step 2: Assign variables and calculate each instance

Let’s define:

- First time: It rang **4 times**
- Second time: It rang **3 times as long as the first time** → 3 × 4 = **12 times**
- Third time: It rang **half as long as the second time** → 12 ÷ 2 = **6 times**

---

### Step 3: Add up the total number of rings

$$
\text{Total rings} = 4 + 12 + 6 = \boxed{22}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **22 times**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Monthly Salary**
Each employee is paid **$600 per month**.

So, the **initial annual salary** is:

$$
600 \times 12 = \$7,200
$$

---

### **Step 2: Salary Increase Policy**
The company increases salaries by **10% of the initial salary** for employees who have **stayed in the company for five years**.

This means that after **5 years**, each employee gets a **10% raise** on their **original annual salary**.

So, the **first raise** (after 5 years) is:

$$
10\% \text{ of } \$7,200 = 0.10 \times 7200 = \$720
$$

So, the **annual salary after 5 years** becomes:

$$
7200 + 720 = \$7,920
$$

---

### **Step 3: Sylvie's Service and Raises**
Sylvie has just completed **5 years** of service (last December), so she is now eligible for the **first raise**.

Now, the question asks:

> What is her **annual salary after three more years of service**?

That means we need to calculate her salary **3 years after** the first raise.

Assuming the **same 10% raise every 5 years**, then after the first raise (at 5 years), she will get another 10% raise **after another 5 years**, i.e., at **10 years total**.

But since we are only looking at **three more years** after the first raise, we are not going to get another full 10% raise yet — only **3 years** of service after the first raise.

However, the problem does **not specify** whether the 10% raise happens **only once every 5 years**, or if it's a **continuous increase** of 10% per year.

But based on the wording:

> "increasing the salaries of each of its employees by 10% of the initial salary every year for those who've stayed in the company for five years."

This suggests that the **raise is given once every 5 years**, not annually.

So, the **only raise** Sylvie gets is the **10% raise at 5 years**, and then no further raises until she has been with the company for **another 5 years**.

So, after **5 years**, her salary is **\$7,920**.

Then, after **3 more years**, she has served **8 years** total.

Since the next raise is only given at **10 years**, she hasn't received it yet.

Therefore, her **annual salary after 3 more years** is still **\$7,920**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$7,920}
$$
We are given:

- Marilyn's record sold **10 times as many copies as Harald's**.
- Together, they sold **88,000 copies**.

Let’s define:

- Let $ H $ be the number of copies Harald sold.
- Then Marilyn sold $ 10H $ copies.

According to the problem:

$$
H + 10H = 88,000
$$

$$
11H = 88,000
$$

Now divide both sides by 11:

$$
H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Harald sold 8,000 copies.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Determine the number of guests who will actually attend**

Christina invited **16 friends**, but **1/4 of the attendees don't show up**.

So, the number of people who **don't show up** is:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4
$$

Therefore, the number of people who **do show up** is:

$$
16 - 4 = 12
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the number of gift bags needed**

She needs **0.75 gift bags per guest**.

So, for 12 guests:

$$
0.75 \times 12 = 9
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total cost**

Each gift bag costs **$2**, so:

$$
9 \times 2 = 18
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $18**
We are given the following information:

- **An adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.**
- **A child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult**, so a child eats $ \frac{10}{2} = 5 $ lbs.
- There are **20 adults** and **5 children** at the picnic.

---

### Step 1: Calculate total amount eaten by adults

Each adult eats 10 lbs, and there are 20 adults:

$$
20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate total amount eaten by children

Each child eats 5 lbs, and there are 5 children:

$$
5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add the totals to find how much potato salad Ted needs to bring

$$
200 \text{ lbs (adults)} + 25 \text{ lbs (children)} = 225 \text{ lbs}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic.**
We are given the following information:

1. **Cindy has 4 pets.**
2. **Marcia has two more pets than Cindy.**
3. **Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.**

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find how many pets Marcia has.

Marcia has **2 more pets** than Cindy, and Cindy has **4 pets**.

$$
\text{Marcia's pets} = 4 + 2 = 6
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many pets Jan has.

Jan has **three times** the number of pets as Marcia.

$$
\text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
$$

---

### Step 3: Add up all the pets.

- Cindy: 4 pets  
- Marcia: 6 pets  
- Jan: 18 pets  

$$
\text{Total pets} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{28}
$$
We are given the following information about Emily's 4 kids:

- The kids are: **Amy, Jackson, Corey, and James**.
- **James is 10 years old.**
- **James is 1 year younger than Corey**, so:
  $$
  \text{Corey} = \text{James} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11
  $$
- **Amy is 5 years older than Jackson**, so:
  $$
  \text{Amy} = \text{Jackson} + 5
  $$
- **Amy is 2 years younger than Corey**, so:
  $$
  \text{Amy} = \text{Corey} - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9
  $$

Now, use the earlier equation where **Amy = Jackson + 5** and we just found that **Amy = 9**, so:

$$
9 = \text{Jackson} + 5
$$

Subtract 5 from both sides:

$$
\text{Jackson} = 9 - 5 = 4
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **Jackson is 4 years old.**
We are given the following:

- Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles **2 seconds faster** than Gerald.
- Gerald improved his speed by **10%** due to a better diet.
- **Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.**

We are asked: **How fast can Gerald, with his improved diet, run the 400-meter hurdles?**

---

### Step 1: Find Gerald's original time

Let’s denote:

- $ L = $ Lee’s time = 38 seconds
- $ G = $ Gerald’s original time

From the problem:

$$
L = G - 2 \Rightarrow 38 = G - 2 \Rightarrow G = 40
$$

So, **Gerald originally ran the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds**.

---

### Step 2: Apply the 10% improvement

Gerald improved his speed by **10%**, which means he now runs **10% faster**, i.e., his new time is **90% of his original time**.

$$
\text{New time} = G \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{36}
$$

Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in **36 seconds**.
We are given the following information:

- The **number of rabbit pets** is **12 less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats**.
- There are **2 cats for every dog**.
- The **number of dogs is 60**.

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Number of dogs

We are told:

> The number of dogs is **60**.

So:
$$
\text{Number of dogs} = 60
$$

---

### Step 2: Number of cats

We are told:

> There are **2 cats for every dog**.

So for every dog, there are 2 cats. Therefore:

$$
\text{Number of cats} = 2 \times \text{Number of dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
$$

---

### Step 3: Combined number of dogs and cats

$$
\text{Dogs + Cats} = 60 + 120 = 180
$$

---

### Step 4: Number of rabbit pets

We are told:

> The number of rabbit pets is **12 less than the combined number of dogs and cats**.

So:

$$
\text{Number of rabbits} = 180 - 12 = 168
$$

---

### Step 5: Total number of pets

Now we add up all the pets:

- Dogs: 60  
- Cats: 120  
- Rabbits: 168  

$$
\text{Total pets} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{348}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### **Step 3: Number of girls**

Since there are 200 students total and 80 are boys, the number of girls is:

$$
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
$$

---

### **Step 4: Number of girls in the Girl Scout**

We are told that **2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout**.

$$
\text{Girls in Girl Scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
$$

---

### **Step 5: Number of girls not in the Girl Scout**

To find how many girls are **not** in the Girl Scout, subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the total number of girls:

$$
\text{Girls not in Girl Scout} = 120 - 80 = 40
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{40}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find out how many hours James slept

Harry slept **9 hours**.

James slept **2/3** of what Harry slept.

So, we calculate:

$$
\text{James' sleep time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the difference in their sleep times

Now we subtract James' sleep time from Harry's:

$$
9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Harry slept 3 more hours than James.**
We are told:

- When Freda cooks canned tomatoes into sauce, they **lose half their volume**.
- Each **16-ounce can** contains **3 tomatoes**.
- Freda’s last batch made **32 ounces of sauce**.

We need to find out how many **tomatoes** she used.

---

### Step 1: Understand the volume loss

When the tomatoes are cooked into sauce, they **lose half their volume**, meaning only **half** of the original volume becomes sauce.

So, if a can of tomatoes has **16 ounces**, then after cooking, it becomes:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \text{ ounces of sauce}
$$

That means **each can produces 8 ounces of sauce**.

---

### Step 2: How many cans were used?

Freda made **32 ounces of sauce**.

Since each can produces **8 ounces of sauce**, the number of cans used is:

$$
\frac{32}{8} = 4 \text{ cans}
$$

---

### Step 3: How many tomatoes per can?

Each can contains **3 tomatoes**.

So, for 4 cans:

$$
4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Freda used 12 tomatoes.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- **Originally 30 cars** are on the motorway.
- **5 cars take an exit** and **don't drive through** the traffic jam.
- In the **first 15 minutes**, some cars **drive through** the traffic jam.
- In the **next 15 minutes**, **20 more cars drive through** the jam.

We are asked: **How many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?**

---

### **Step 1: Total number of cars that actually drove through the jam**

- Originally, there were **30 cars**.
- But **5 cars took an exit** and **did not drive through** the jam.
  
So, the number of cars that **did** drive through the jam is:

$$
30 - 5 = 25 \text{ cars}
$$

---

### **Step 2: How many drove through in each time period**

- Let’s call the number of cars that drove through in the **first 15 minutes** = $ x $
- Then, in the **second 15 minutes**, **20 cars** drove through.

So we have:

$$
x + 20 = 25
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $**

$$
x = 25 - 20 = 5
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{5}
$$

**5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many potted plants Mary will **remain with** after giving some away.

---

### Step 1: How many potted plants does Mary already have?

Mary has **2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges**.

$$
\text{Total plants on ledges} = 2 \times 40 = 80
$$

So, she already has **80 potted plants**.

---

### Step 2: How many new potted plants did she receive?

She received **18 new potted plants** from the nursery.

$$
\text{Total plants now} = 80 + 18 = 98
$$

---

### Step 3: How many plants will she give away?

She plans to give **1 potted plant from each ledge** to friends and family.

There are **40 ledges**, so she will give away:

$$
\text{Plants given away} = 1 \times 40 = 40
$$

---

### Step 4: How many plants will she remain with?

$$
\text{Remaining plants} = 98 - 40 = 58
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.**
Let's break this down step by step.

We are told:

- **Fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.**
- **Third friend pressed 10 times more than the fourth friend.**
- **Second friend pressed 1/4 times more than the first friend.**
- **First friend pressed 20 times.**

We need to find the **total number of doorbell rings** made by all four friends.

---

### Step 1: First friend
> First friend pressed the doorbell **20 times**.

$$
\text{First friend} = 20
$$

---

### Step 2: Second friend
> Second friend pressed **1/4 times more** than the first friend.

This means:
$$
\text{Second friend} = \text{First friend} + \frac{1}{4} \times \text{First friend}
= 20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25
$$

$$
\text{Second friend} = 25
$$

---

### Step 3: Fourth friend
> Fourth friend pressed **60 times**.

$$
\text{Fourth friend} = 60
$$

---

### Step 4: Third friend
> Third friend pressed **10 times more** than the fourth friend.

$$
\text{Third friend} = 60 + 10 = 70
$$

$$
\text{Third friend} = 70
$$

---

### Step 5: Total doorbell rings

Now, add up all the presses:

$$
\text{Total} = \text{First} + \text{Second} + \text{Third} + \text{Fourth}
= 20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 175
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{175}
$$

The doorbell rang **175 times** in total.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find the total number of pages Solo needs to read**

He has to read:

- **Science**: 4 pages  
- **Social Studies**: 20 pages  
- **History**: 7 pages  
- **Geography**: 8 pages  

**Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages**

---

### **Step 2: Subtract the pages he already read on Monday**

He read **15 pages on Monday**, so the remaining pages are:

**Remaining pages = 39 - 15 = 24 pages**

---

### **Step 3: He has 4 more days to finish reading**

So, he needs to read **24 pages over 4 days**.

To find the average number of pages per day:

$$
\text{Average pages per day} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 6 pages per day**
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many days John drinks water

John drinks water **every weekday** and **on weekends he has soda with dinner**, so he **does not drink water with dinner on weekends**.

So, he drinks water **only on weekdays**.

There are **5 weekdays** in a week (Monday to Friday).

---

### Step 2: How many glasses of water does he drink each weekday?

He drinks **one glass of water** with:

- Breakfast  
- Lunch  
- Dinner  

That’s **3 glasses per day**.

---

### Step 3: Total glasses in a week

So, for 5 weekdays:

$$
5 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ glasses/day} = 15 \text{ glasses}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**John drinks 15 glasses of water in a week.**
We are told:

- The fog bank **covers 3 miles of the city in 10 minutes**.
- The city is **42 miles across** from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.

We need to find how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the **entire 42-mile width** of the city.

---

### Step 1: Determine the rate of fog coverage

The fog covers **3 miles in 10 minutes**, so the rate is:

$$
\text{Rate} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.3 \text{ miles per minute}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the time to cover 42 miles

Now, we want to know how long it takes to cover **42 miles** at this rate.

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{42 \text{ miles}}{0.3 \text{ miles per minute}} = 140 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{140} \text{ minutes}
$$

It will take **140 minutes** for the fog bank to cover the entire city.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Total number of puzzle pieces

Poppy is solving a **1000-piece** jigsaw puzzle.

---

### Step 2: Poppy places a quarter of the pieces

A quarter of 1000 is:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
$$

So, Poppy places **250** pieces on the board.

Now, the number of pieces **remaining** is:

$$
1000 - 250 = 750
$$

---

### Step 3: Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces

Her mom places a third of the **remaining** 750 pieces:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
$$

So, her mom places **250** more pieces.

Now, the number of pieces **left to be placed** is:

$$
750 - 250 = 500
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{500}
$$

**500 pieces are left to be placed.**
We are given:

- Cody eats **three times as many cookies as Amir**.
- Amir eats **5 cookies**.

### Step 1: Find how many cookies Cody eats
Cody eats 3 times as many as Amir:

$$
\text{Cody's cookies} = 3 \times \text{Amir's cookies} = 3 \times 5 = 15
$$

### Step 2: Add the number of cookies both eat together
$$
\text{Total cookies} = \text{Amir's cookies} + \text{Cody's cookies} = 5 + 15 = 20
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{20}
$$
We are given that John has **3 boxes**, and each box is **5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches**, with **walls that are 1 inch thick**.

We are asked to find the **total inner volume** of all 3 boxes.

---

### Step 1: Understand the dimensions

Each box has outer dimensions:

- Length = 5 inches  
- Width = 6 inches  
- Height = 4 inches  

But the walls are **1 inch thick**, so we need to subtract **2 inches from each dimension** (1 inch from each side).

So, the **inner dimensions** of each box are:

- Inner length = 5 - 2 = **3 inches**
- Inner width = 6 - 2 = **4 inches**
- Inner height = 4 - 2 = **2 inches**

---

### Step 2: Calculate the inner volume of one box

$$
\text{Inner volume of one box} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
= 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
$$

---

### Step 3: Multiply by 3 for all 3 boxes

$$
\text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{72} \text{ cubic inches}
$$
We are told that Frankie watched a total of **7 hours** of TV over the week. We need to find out how many **30-minute episodes** he watched on **Wednesday**.

---

### Step 1: Convert all times to minutes (to make calculations easier)

- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 30 minutes = 30 minutes

---

### Step 2: Break down the TV watching by day

#### Monday:
- 1-hour episode → 60 minutes

#### Tuesday:
- 1-hour episode → 60 minutes

#### Wednesday:
- Let’s say he watched **x** 30-minute episodes → total time = **30x** minutes

#### Thursday:
- 1-hour episode → 60 minutes
- 30-minute show → 30 minutes  
→ Total = 60 + 30 = **90 minutes**

#### Friday:
- 2 × 1-hour episodes → 2 × 60 = **120 minutes**

---

### Step 3: Add up all the time

Total time =  
(60 [Mon]) + (60 [Tue]) + (30x [Wed]) + (90 [Thu]) + (120 [Fri])  
= 60 + 60 + 30x + 90 + 120  
= 330 + 30x minutes

We are told this equals **7 hours**, which is **420 minutes**.

So:

$$
330 + 30x = 420
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for x

$$
30x = 420 - 330 = 90
$$
$$
x = \frac{90}{30} = 3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Frankie watched **3** 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the unknown
Let $ x $ be the number of cookies Henry **intended** to bake **last year**.

---

### Step 2: He wants to make **twice as many** this year
So, he intended to bake:
$$
2x \text{ cookies this year}
$$

---

### Step 3: He actually baked **15 more** than he meant to
So, he actually baked:
$$
2x + 15 \text{ cookies}
$$

---

### Step 4: He drops 5 cookies
So, after dropping 5, he has:
$$
(2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10 \text{ cookies left}
$$

---

### Step 5: He now has a total of 110 cookies
So,
$$
2x + 10 = 110
$$

---

### Step 6: Solve for $ x $
$$
2x + 10 = 110 \\
2x = 100 \\
x = 50
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Henry baked **50 cookies last year**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Price of gas per gallon**: $3.00  
2. **Cashback per gallon**: $0.20  
3. **Number of gallons purchased**: 10  

---

### Step 1: Total cost of gas before cashback  
$$
\text{Total cost} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00
$$

---

### Step 2: Total cashback received  
$$
\text{Total cashback} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00
$$

---

### Step 3: Net amount the person pays (after cashback)  
$$
\text{Net amount paid} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total cashback} = \$30.00 - \$2.00 = \$28.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**The person will pay $28.00 after the cashback rewards.**
We are told that Marcell and Beatrice are having a contest to see who can eat the most fruit roll-ups. They each ate some amount, and we are asked to find the **average** number of roll-ups they both ate.

---

### Step 1: Understand the dimensions

- **Beatrice's roll-ups**:  
  - Width = 2 roll-ups  
  - Length = 24 roll-ups  
  - So, total roll-ups = $ 2 \times 24 = 48 $

- **Marcell's roll-ups**:  
  - Width = 3 roll-ups  
  - Length = 14 roll-ups  
  - So, total roll-ups = $ 3 \times 14 = 42 $

---

### Step 2: Add up the total number of roll-ups eaten

$$
\text{Total} = 48 + 42 = 90
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the average

There are 2 people, so the average is:

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{90}{2} = 45
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{45}
$$

They ate an average of **45 fruit roll-ups** each.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- **Water intake rate:** 2 liters per 10 feet.
- **Julia's rowing speed:** She rows 20 feet in 16 seconds.
- **Distance to shore:** 64 seconds away.
- **Goal:** How much water did the boat take on by the time Julia reached shore?

---

### **Step 1: Find Julia's rowing speed in feet per second**

She rows **20 feet in 16 seconds**:

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find how many feet she rows in 64 seconds**

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.25 \text{ feet/sec} \times 64 \text{ sec} = 80 \text{ feet}
$$

So, she rows **80 feet** before reaching shore.

---

### **Step 3: Determine how much water the boat takes on per foot**

She takes in **2 liters per 10 feet**, so:

$$
\text{Water per foot} = \frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total water taken on over 80 feet**

$$
\text{Total water} = 0.2 \text{ liters/foot} \times 80 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ liters}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{16 \text{ liters}}
$$

By the time Julia reached shore, the boat had taken on **16 liters of water**.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: How many lessons does each teacher have per day?**

Each teacher has **2 lessons per day**.

---

### **Step 2: How many times is the whiteboard cleaned per lesson?**

The whiteboard is cleaned **3 times per lesson**.

---

### **Step 3: How many lessons are there in total per day?**

There are **4 teachers**, and each has **2 lessons per day**:

$$
4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons per teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons per day}
$$

---

### **Step 4: How many times is the whiteboard cleaned in a day?**

Each of the 8 lessons has 3 cleanings:

$$
8 \text{ lessons} \times 3 \text{ cleanings per lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings per day}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{24}
$$

The whiteboard is cleaned **24 times per day**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Find out how many flowers Ryan plants in total.**

Ryan plants **2 flowers per day** for **15 days**.

$$
2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers}
$$

**Step 2: Subtract the number of flowers that did not grow.**

Out of the 30 flowers planted, **5 did not grow**.

$$
30 - 5 = 25
$$

**Final Answer:**  
Ryan has **25 flowers** that grew.
We are given the following information:

1. **Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.**
2. **The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.**
3. **Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.**

We are asked to find:  
**How many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo?**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables.

Let:
- $ J $ = number of photos Jamal's phone can hold = **1800**
- $ B $ = number of photos Brittany's phone can hold
- $ D $ = number of ducks in Jamal's photo (this is what we're trying to find)
- $ B_{\text{birds}} $ = number of birds in Jamal's photo (not directly given, but related to $ B $)

From the problem:

> "Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photo."

So:
$$
B = 50 \times B_{\text{birds}}
$$

But we don’t know $ B_{\text{birds}} $. However, from the first statement:

> "Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone."

So:
$$
J = 6 \times B
$$

We are told $ J = 1800 $, so:
$$
1800 = 6 \times B
$$

Now solve for $ B $:
$$
B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
$$

So Brittany's phone can hold **300** photos.

---

### Step 2: Use the second relationship.

We were told:
$$
B = 50 \times B_{\text{birds}}
$$

We just found $ B = 300 $, so:
$$
300 = 50 \times B_{\text{birds}} \Rightarrow B_{\text{birds}} = \frac{300}{50} = 6
$$

So there are **6 birds** in Jamal's photo.

But wait! The question asks:

> **How many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo?**

That is, it’s asking for the number of **ducks**, not birds.

However, the problem says:

> "The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo."

So the **number of birds** in the photo is **6**.

But the photo is of **ducks**, and the question is asking how many **ducks** are in the photo.

So unless there is a misinterpretation or trick, the answer is:

> **6 ducks**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{6}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to calculate **how much profit Sasha makes** if she sells all her leftover lumber.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the problem**

Sasha has two types of lumber left:

- **Ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards**, each costing **$10**
- **Five 4 x 4 x 10 boards**, each costing **$16**

She is selling them all, and we are told that prices have gone up **50%** since she bought them. So we need to figure out **what price she sells them for** (based on the 50% increase), then compute her **total revenue**, and finally subtract her **cost** to get the **profit**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total cost**

#### For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- 10 boards × $10 = **$100**

#### For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- 5 boards × $16 = **$80**

#### Total cost:
$$
\$100 + \$80 = \boxed{\$180}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine selling price per board**

We are told that prices have gone up **50%** since Sasha bought them. That means she sells them at **150%** of the original price.

So:

- Selling price of a 2 x 4 x 10 board = $10 × 1.5 = **$15**
- Selling price of a 4 x 4 x 10 board = $16 × 1.5 = **$24**

---

### **Step 4: Calculate total revenue**

#### From 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- 10 boards × $15 = **$150**

#### From 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- 5 boards × $24 = **$120**

#### Total revenue:
$$
\$150 + \$120 = \boxed{\$270}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Calculate profit**

Profit = Revenue – Cost  
$$
\$270 - \$180 = \boxed{\$90}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Sasha makes a profit of $90.**
We are given:

- The ratio of **teaspoons of sugar to cups of water** is **7:13**.
- The **total amount of sugar and water used is 120** (in **teaspoons** and **cups**, but we need to be careful with units).
- We are to find the **number of teaspoonfuls of sugar** she used.

---

### Step 1: Understand the ratio

The ratio of **sugar to water** is **7:13**. That means for every **7 teaspoons of sugar**, there are **13 cups of water**.

But we are told that the **total amount of sugar and water used is 120**. This must mean that the **total in teaspoons** is 120, and we need to find how many of those are **teaspoons of sugar**.

So we can treat this as a **ratio problem where the total is 120**, and we want to find the **portion that is sugar**.

---

### Step 2: Add the parts of the ratio

The ratio is **7:13**, so the total number of parts is:

$$
7 + 13 = 20 \text{ parts}
$$

This means that:

- **7 parts** correspond to **teaspoons of sugar**
- **13 parts** correspond to **cups of water**

But since the total is **120**, and we're looking for the **teaspoonfuls of sugar**, we can say:

$$
\text{Teaspoons of sugar} = \frac{7}{20} \times 120
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate

$$
\frac{7}{20} \times 120 = \frac{840}{20} = 42
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{42}
$$

Katy used **42 teaspoons of sugar**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of children**: 3  
2. **Pairs of shoes per child**: 2  
3. **Cost per pair of shoes**: $60  

---

**Step 1: Total number of pairs of shoes**  
John buys 2 pairs for each of his 3 children:  
$$
3 \text{ children} \times 2 \text{ pairs/child} = 6 \text{ pairs}
$$

---

**Step 2: Total cost**  
Each pair costs $60, so:  
$$
6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60/\text{pair} = \$360
$$

---

**Final Answer**:  
$$
\boxed{\$360}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**

- On the **first day**, the customs officer counted **2 containers**, each with **5 vehicles**.
- So, the number of vehicles on the first day is:

$$
2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
$$

- On the **second day**, more containers were brought in.
- The **total number of vehicles at the port after the second day** is **30**.
- All containers contain **5 vehicles**.

---

### **Step 2: Find the number of vehicles added on the second day**

Total vehicles after second day = 30  
Vehicles from first day = 10  
So, vehicles added on the second day = 

$$
30 - 10 = 20 \text{ vehicles}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the number of containers on the second day**

Each container has 5 vehicles.  
So, number of containers on the second day is:

$$
\frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{4} \text{ containers}
$$
We are given the following information:

- **Adrien's current salary** is **30% higher than Lylah's**.
- **Four years ago**, Adrien was earning **$40,000**.
- Four years later (i.e., now), **Adrien's salary has increased**, and he is now earning **40% more than what he earned four years ago**.
- We are to find the **total salary** that Adrien and Lylah were receiving **four years later**.

---

### Step 1: Find Adrien's current salary

We are told that **Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago**, and now he earns **40% more** than that.

$$
\text{Current salary of Adrien} = 40,000 + 0.4 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.4 = 56,000
$$

So, **Adrien's current salary is $56,000**.

---

### Step 2: Use the relationship between Adrien and Lylah’s salaries

We are told that **Adrien's total salary is 30% higher than Lylah's**. That means:

$$
\text{Adrien's salary} = 1.3 \times \text{Lylah's salary}
$$

We know Adrien's current salary is **$56,000**, so:

$$
56,000 = 1.3 \times \text{Lylah's current salary}
$$

Solve for Lylah's current salary:

$$
\text{Lylah's current salary} = \frac{56,000}{1.3} = 43,076.92
$$

So, **Lylah's current salary is approximately $43,076.92**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total salary four years later

Now, we add Adrien's and Lylah's current salaries:

$$
\text{Total salary} = 56,000 + 43,076.92 = 99,076.92
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{99,076.92}
$$

So, the total salary the two were receiving **four years later** is **$99,076.92**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Paper used per week**:  
   Miguel uses **2 pads of paper** each week.

2. **Sheets per pad**:  
   Each pad has **30 sheets** of paper.

3. **Sheets per week**:  
   $ 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} $

4. **Sheets per month**:  
   Assuming a month has **4 weeks**, then:  
   $ 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month} $

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many fruits Morisette brought.
- **Apples**: 5
- **Oranges**: 8  
So, total fruits Morisette brought = 5 + 8 = **13 fruits**

---

### Step 2: Determine how many fruits Kael brought.

- **Apples**: Kael brought **twice** the amount of apples that Morisette brought.  
  So, 2 × 5 = **10 apples**

- **Oranges**: Kael brought **half** the number of oranges that Morisette brought.  
  So, 8 ÷ 2 = **4 oranges**

So, total fruits Kael brought = 10 + 4 = **14 fruits**

---

### Step 3: Add both totals to find the total number of fruits.

- Morisette: 13 fruits  
- Kael: 14 fruits  
**Total = 13 + 14 = 27 fruits**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **27 fruits** in total.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Hours slept on Monday
Sadie slept **8 hours** on **Monday**.

---

### Step 2: Hours slept on Tuesday and Wednesday
For the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), she slept **2 hours less** than on Monday.

So:
- Tuesday: $ 8 - 2 = 6 $ hours
- Wednesday: $ 8 - 2 = 6 $ hours

Total for Tuesday and Wednesday:
$$
6 + 6 = 12 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 3: Hours slept from Thursday to Sunday
The rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday) is **4 days**. She slept **1 hour more** than those two days (Tuesday and Wednesday).

She slept **6 hours** each day on Tuesday and Wednesday, so:
$$
6 + 1 = 7 \text{ hours per day}
$$

Total for Thursday to Sunday:
$$
7 \times 4 = 28 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total hours for the week
Add up all the days:

- Monday: 8 hours  
- Tuesday: 6 hours  
- Wednesday: 6 hours  
- Thursday to Sunday: 28 hours  

$$
8 + 6 + 6 + 28 = 48 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Sadie slept a total of 48 hours during the week.**
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how far Rosie runs at 10 mph**

Rosie runs at **10 miles per hour** for **3 hours**.

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how much time is left after the first 3 hours**

Total time = 7 hours  
Time already used = 3 hours  
Remaining time = $ 7 - 3 = 4 $ hours

---

### **Step 3: Determine how far Rosie runs at 5 mph**

She runs at **5 miles per hour** for the remaining **4 hours**.

$$
\text{Distance} = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add both distances**

$$
\text{Total distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = \boxed{50} \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **50 miles**.

### **Step 1: Understand the problem**

- Jennie has **60 letters** that **need stamps**.
- She also has a pile of **already-stamped letters**.
- She puts **stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps**.
- After doing this, there are **30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters**.
- We are asked to find **how many letters were in the already-stamped pile when Jennie began**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how many letters Jennie stamped**

Jennie stamps **one-third of the 60 letters** that need stamps:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \text{ letters}
$$

So, she added **20 new stamped letters** to the already-stamped pile.

---

### **Step 3: Use the final count of already-stamped letters**

After adding the 20 new ones, the total number of already-stamped letters is **30**.

That means **before** she added the 20 new ones, the already-stamped pile had:

$$
30 - 20 = 10 \text{ letters}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{10}
$$

So, **10 letters** were in the already-stamped pile when Jennie began.

So:
$$
x + 2 = 12
$$

---

### Step 5: Solve for x

$$
x = 12 - 2 = 10
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.**

- He bought **6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages**.

---

### Step 2: Find the number of fish sausages

Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages:

$$
\text{Fish sausages} = \text{Chicken sausages} + 6 = 38 + 6 = 44
$$

---

### Step 3: Add the total number of sausages

$$
\text{Total sausages} = \text{Chicken sausages} + \text{Fish sausages} = 38 + 44 = 82
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Define the prices**

We are told:

- Each **pepper** costs **$15**.
- A **watermelon** costs **three times** what a pepper costs.
- An **orange** costs **$5 less** than a watermelon.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the cost of each item**

#### **Watermelon cost:**
$$
\text{Watermelon} = 3 \times \text{Pepper} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
$$

#### **Orange cost:**
$$
\text{Orange} = \text{Watermelon} - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total cost for each item**

Dillon buys:

- 4 watermelons  
- 20 peppers  
- 10 oranges

#### **Total cost for watermelons:**
$$
4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
$$

#### **Total cost for peppers:**
$$
20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
$$

#### **Total cost for oranges:**
$$
10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add up all the costs**

$$
\text{Total} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $880**
Let's break this down step by step to calculate the **profit** the hospital makes from these visits.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many patients are seen per hour**

- The hospital sees **500 people a day**.
- Each patient is seen for **24 minutes**.
- There are **60 minutes in an hour**.

So, the number of patients seen per hour is:

$$
\frac{500 \text{ patients/day}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = \frac{500}{60} \approx 8.33 \text{ patients/hour}
$$

But we can also find the **total time spent per day** on patients:

$$
500 \text{ patients} \times 24 \text{ minutes/patient} = 12,000 \text{ minutes/day}
$$

Convert that to hours:

$$
\frac{12,000 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 200 \text{ hours/day}
$$

So the hospital spends **200 hours per day** seeing patients.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total revenue from doctors and patients**

#### **Revenue from doctors (charging $150/hour):**

$$
200 \text{ hours/day} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 \text{ dollars/day}
$$

#### **Revenue from patients (charging $200/hour):**

$$
200 \text{ hours/day} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40,000 \text{ dollars/day}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total profit**

Profit = Revenue from patients - Revenue from doctors

$$
40,000 - 30,000 = 10,000 \text{ dollars/day}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

The hospital makes **$10,000 per day** from these visits.
Let's solve this step by step.

**Step 1: Start with the total number of elves.**

Nissa hires **60** seasonal workers to play elves.

So, we start with:

$$
60 \text{ elves}
$$

---

**Step 2: A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them.**

A third of 60 is:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \text{ elves}
$$

So, **20 elves quit**, leaving:

$$
60 - 20 = 40 \text{ elves remaining}
$$

---

**Step 3: Then 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.**

From the 40 elves that remained, **10 quit**.

So, the number of elves left now is:

$$
40 - 10 = 30 \text{ elves}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{30}
$$

**30 elves are left.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Expenditure in May** = $500  
2. **Expenditure in June** = $60 less than in May  
   - So, $500 - $60 = **$440**

3. **Total expenditure for May and June** = Expenditure in May + Expenditure in June  
   - $500 + $440 = **$940**

### ✅ Final Answer: **$940**

  - Roller coaster: 4 times
  - Luge: 2 times  
  → Total rides = 4 + 2 = **6 rides**

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of tickets used

Each ride costs **6 tickets**, so:

- **Pam**: 4 rides × 6 tickets/ride = **24 tickets**
- **Fred**: 6 rides × 6 tickets/ride = **36 tickets**

---

### Step 3: Add both amounts to find the total tickets used that day

Total tickets used = 24 (Pam) + 36 (Fred) = **60 tickets**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **60 tickets**

### Step 1: Miles walked on Monday

We are told:

> On **Monday**, Walt walked **4 miles**.

So,

$$
\text{Monday} = 4 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 2: Miles walked on Tuesday

We are told:

> On **Tuesday**, he walked **6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday**.

So,

$$
\text{Tuesday} = 6 \times \text{Monday} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total mileage from Monday through Wednesday

We are told:

> His total mileage **Monday through Wednesday** was **41 miles**.

So,

$$
\text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} = 41
$$

We already know:

- Monday = 4
- Tuesday = 24

So,

$$
4 + 24 + \text{Wednesday} = 41
$$

$$
28 + \text{Wednesday} = 41
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for Wednesday

$$
\text{Wednesday} = 41 - 28 = 13
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{13} \text{ miles}
$$

Walt walked **13 miles on Wednesday**.

### Step 1: Understand the problem

We are told:

- **Brian has 20 video games**, but **he lost 5 right before the comparison was made**.
- **Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does.**

So, we need to find out how many **video games Bobby has**, based on Brian’s adjusted number (after losing 5).

---

### Step 2: Find Brian’s actual number of video games

Brian originally had **20 video games**, but he **lost 5** before the comparison.

So, Brian now has:

$$
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ video games}
$$

---

### Step 3: Use the relationship between Brian and Bobby

We're told:

> Bobby has **5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does**.

So, in math terms:

$$
\text{Bobby's games} = 3 \times (\text{Brian's games}) - 5
$$

Substitute Brian’s current number of games (15):

$$
\text{Bobby's games} = 3 \times 15 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{40}
$$

Bobby has **40 video games**.

### Step 1: Total number of cars
We are told there are **20** cars in total.

### Step 2: Number of automatic and manual cars
- Automatic cars: **12**
- Manual cars: **4**

### Step 3: Find the number of semi-automatic cars
We subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total:

$$
\text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4
$$

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars
$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100
$$
$$
= \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**20%** of the cars are semi-automatic.
We are given the following information:

- Total number of bees in the hive = **700**
- There are **twice as many worker bees as baby bees**.
- There are **twice as many babies as queens**.

Let’s define variables:

- Let **Q** = number of **queens**
- Then, number of **baby bees** = **2Q** (since there are twice as many babies as queens)
- Number of **worker bees** = **2 × (number of baby bees)** = **2 × 2Q = 4Q**

Now, total number of bees is the sum of:

- Queens: Q  
- Baby bees: 2Q  
- Worker bees: 4Q  

So:

$$
Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700
$$

$$
7Q = 700
$$

$$
Q = 100
$$

Now, number of **worker bees** is:

$$
4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400
$$

Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Identify which items are **nonfood** (subject to 10% tax)
- **Milk**: This is a **food item**, so **no tax**.
- **Eggs**: Also a **food item**, so **no tax**.
- **Light bulbs**: **Nonfood**, subject to **10% tax**.
- **Cups**: **Nonfood**, subject to **10% tax**.
- **Roach traps**: **Nonfood**, subject to **10% tax**.

So, **milk and eggs are exempt from tax**, and the rest are taxed at 10%.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of nonfood items before tax

- Light bulbs: $3  
- Cups: $3  
- Roach traps: $4  

Total nonfood cost before tax:  
$$
3 + 3 + 4 = 10 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Apply 10% tax on nonfood items

$$
10\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.10 \times 10 = 1 \text{ dollar}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add the food items (no tax)

- Milk: $2  
- Eggs: $3  

Total food cost:  
$$
2 + 3 = 5 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 5: Total cost including tax

$$
\text{Nonfood cost with tax} = 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ dollars}  
$$
$$
\text{Total cost} = 11 + 5 = \boxed{16} \text{ dollars}
$$

So, **total cost per client = $4 + $5 = $9**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total expenses for all clients**
- Total clients = 8
- Cost per client = $9  
→ Total expenses = 8 × $9 = **$72**

---

### **Step 4: Total income**
- Total income per week = **$92**

---

### **Step 5: Calculate profit**
Profit = Total Income – Total Expenses  
= $92 – $72 = **$20**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

### Step 1: Determine the total number of pineapples per hectare per year
- John harvests **every 3 months**.
- There are **4 periods of 3 months in a year** (since 12 ÷ 3 = 4).
- Each hectare has **100 pineapples** per harvest.

So, per hectare per year:
$$
100 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year}
$$

### Step 2: Multiply by the total number of hectares
John has **10 hectares**.

$$
400 \text{ pineapples/hectare/year} \times 10 \text{ hectares} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.**
Let's break this down step by step.

We are told:

1. Johnny finds **one** Lego box with **500 pieces**.
2. Another box has **3 times more** pieces than the 500-piece one.
3. A third box has **1/4 the number of pieces** of the 500-piece one.

We need to find the **total number of blocks** Johnny picks up.

---

### Step 1: First box
- Pieces = **500**

---

### Step 2: Second box
- It has **3 times more** than 500.
- So, 3 × 500 = **1500 pieces**

---

### Step 3: Third box
- It has **1/4 the number of pieces** of the 500-piece box.
- So, 500 ÷ 4 = **125 pieces**

---

### Step 4: Total number of blocks
Now add them all together:

- 500 (first box)  
- + 1500 (second box)  
- + 125 (third box)  
= **500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Johnny picks up a total of 2125 blocks.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: First 6 hours

Debra sees **30 bees leave** the hive in the first 6 hours.

So:
- **Bees that left in first 6 hours = 30**

---

### Step 2: Next 6 hours (returning)

She sees **1/2 that many bees return** in the next 6 hours.

That is:
- **Return in next 6 hours = (1/2) × 30 = 15 bees**

So, **15 bees return** in the next 6 hours.

---

### Step 3: "She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours."

This part is a bit confusing. Let’s parse it carefully:

> "She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours."

This seems to be saying:

- The number of bees that **left in the first 6 hours** = 30
- Then, in the **next 6 hours**, she sees **two times as many bees** as that — i.e., 2 × 30 = **60 bees**

But wait — this contradicts what we had earlier. Earlier, we said that in the next 6 hours, only **15 bees returned**.

So this must mean that the **total number of bees that left in the first 6 hours and then later returned** is **60**.

But we already have:

- 30 bees left in the first 6 hours.
- 15 bees returned in the next 6 hours.

So total of **45 bees** have been accounted for so far.

But according to this sentence:

> "She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours."

That means:

- She sees **twice as many bees as the ones that left in the first 6 hours** fly **from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours**.

Wait — maybe the correct interpretation is:

> She sees **two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive** fly **from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours**.

So:

- First 6 hours: 30 bees left.
- In the next 6 hours, she sees **2 × 30 = 60 bees** leave the hive again.

So, in the **next 6 hours**, **60 bees leave the hive**.

Then, the last sentence says:

> "Every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours."

So, all the **30 bees that left in the first 6 hours** return in the **next 6 hours**.

But earlier, we thought only 15 returned, but now we are told that **all 30 return** in the next 6 hours.

So let's revise our previous understanding.

---

### Revised Interpretation:

- First 6 hours: 30 bees **leave** the hive.
- Next 6 hours:
  - 60 bees **leave** the hive (as per "two times as many as first left").
  - All 30 bees that left in the first 6 hours **return** in the next 6 hours.

So, in the **last 6 hours**, Debra sees **30 bees return** to the hive.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{30}
$$

So, Debra saw **30 bees return** to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the cost of the tickets

- **Adult ticket:** $12  
- **Child ticket:** $10  

Brittany's mom buys **1 adult ticket** and **1 child ticket**.

So, the total cost is:

$$
12 + 10 = 22 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the information about change

She received **$8 in change**. That means she gave the cashier **more than $22**, and the difference is $8.

So, the amount she gave the cashier is:

$$
22 + 8 = 30 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{30}
$$

Brittany's mom gave the cashier **$30**.
We are given the following information:

- Charlie has **three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy**.
- James has **four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy**.
- Charlie has **12 Facebook friends**.

We are asked to find how many **Facebook friends James has**.

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ D $ = number of Facebook friends Dorothy has
- $ C $ = number of Facebook friends Charlie has
- $ J $ = number of Facebook friends James has

From the problem:

- $ C = 3D $
- $ J = 4D $
- $ C = 12 $

---

### Step 2: Use the known value of $ C $

We know:
$$
C = 12
$$
But also:
$$
C = 3D
$$

So:
$$
3D = 12
$$

Solve for $ D $:
$$
D = \frac{12}{3} = 4
$$

---

### Step 3: Find $ J $ using $ J = 4D $

Now that we know $ D = 4 $, substitute into $ J = 4D $:

$$
J = 4 \times 4 = 16
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**James has 16 Facebook friends.**
We are given the following information:

- **Steve** lives **3 miles** from school and can bike at **440 feet per minute**.
- **Tim** lives **2 miles** from school and can skate at **264 feet per minute**.
- We need to find **how long the winner will wait at their house before the loser finishes the race**.

---

### Step 1: Convert all distances to **feet**

We know:
- 1 mile = 5280 feet

So:

- Steve's distance = 3 miles × 5280 ft/mile = **15,840 feet**
- Tim's distance = 2 miles × 5280 ft/mile = **10,560 feet**

---

### Step 2: Calculate time for each person to get home

**Time = Distance ÷ Speed**

#### Steve's time:
$$
\text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = \frac{15,840}{440} = 36 \text{ minutes}
$$

#### Tim's time:
$$
\text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} = \frac{10,560}{264} = 40 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine who wins and how long the winner waits

- Steve takes **36 minutes**, Tim takes **40 minutes**.
- So **Steve wins** the race.
- The **winner (Steve)** will wait **40 - 36 = 4 minutes** before the **loser (Tim)** finishes.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The winner (Steve) will wait 4 minutes at their house before the loser (Tim) finishes the race.**
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much Shawnda made that day.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the pricing**
- Each **tire** costs **25 cents** to inflate.
- So, each **tire = $0.25**

---

### **Step 2: Count the number of tires inflated**

We are told:

- **5 people on bicycles** came by.
  - Each bicycle has **2 tires**.
  - So, 5 people × 2 tires = **10 tires**

- **3 people on tricycles** came by.
  - Each tricycle has **3 tires**.
  - So, 3 people × 3 tires = **9 tires**

- **1 person on a unicycle** came by.
  - A unicycle has **1 tire**.
  - So, 1 person × 1 tire = **1 tire**

Now, total number of tires inflated:

$$
10 + 9 + 1 = 20 \text{ tires}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total earnings**

Each tire is $0.25, so:

$$
20 \text{ tires} \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{5} \text{ dollars}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find the total number of cookies**

Carl buys **10 packs** of cookies, and each pack has **6 cookies**.

$$
\text{Total cookies} = 10 \times 6 = 60 \text{ cookies}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the total cost of the cookies**

Each cookie costs **$0.10**.

$$
\text{Total cost} = 60 \times 0.10 = \$6.00
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the change from a $10 bill**

Carl pays with a **$10 bill**, so:

$$
\text{Change} = 10 - 6 = \$4.00
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Carl receives $4.00 in change.**
Let's work through the problem step by step, and figure out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let’s call the **original number of fries** in the pack **x**.

We are told:

- Dave ate **14** fries.
- A seagull ate **half the amount** that Dave ate → that’s **7** fries.
- Then **three pigeons** each ate **3** fries → total of **9** fries.
- Then a **raccoon** stole **two-thirds** of the remaining fries.
- Finally, **ants carried off 1 fry**, leaving **5** fries.

We need to find the original number of fries, **x**.

---

### Step 2: Work backwards from the end

Let’s start from the **end** and go **backwards**, since we know the final amount of fries left is **5**.

#### Final step:
- **Ants took 1 fry**, leaving **5**.
- So before the ants took their fry, there were **5 + 1 = 6** fries.

So, **before the ants**, there were **6** fries.

#### Before the raccoon stole:
- The raccoon stole **two-thirds** of the remaining fries.
- That means **one-third** of the fries remained after the raccoon stole.
- So if **one-third = 6**, then the **total before the raccoon stole** was:
  $$
  6 \times 3 = 18
  $$

So, **before the raccoon**, there were **18** fries.

#### Before the pigeons:
- Three pigeons each ate **3** fries → total of **9**.
- So before the pigeons, there were:
  $$
  18 + 9 = 27
  $$

#### Before the seagull:
- The seagull ate **half** of what Dave ate.
- Dave ate **14**, so the seagull ate **7**.
- So before the seagull, there were:
  $$
  27 + 7 = 34
  $$

#### Before Dave ate:
- Dave ate **14** fries.
- So before Dave, there were:
  $$
  34 + 14 = 48
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{48}
$$

So, **Dave bought a pack of 48 french fries.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many **hours** Kimo spends attending classes in one semester.

---

### Step 1: Understand the schedule

- **Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays**:  
  - 3 classes per day  
  - Each class is **1 hour**  
  - So, **3 hours per day**

- **Tuesdays, Thursdays**:  
  - 2 classes per day  
  - Each class is **2 hours**  
  - So, **4 hours per day**

---

### Step 2: Calculate daily class time

- **Monday, Wednesday, Friday**: 3 hours/day  
- **Tuesday, Thursday**: 4 hours/day  

So, in a **week**, Kimo has:

- 3 days × 3 hours = **9 hours**  
- 2 days × 4 hours = **8 hours**  
- Total per week = **9 + 8 = 17 hours**

---

### Step 3: Multiply by number of weeks

- One semester has **16 weeks**  
- So total class time in a semester =  
  $$
  17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**272 hours**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the quantities and lengths**

Bill bakes:

- **300 rolls**  
  - Each roll is **4 inches long**
- **120 croissants**  
  - Each croissant is **6 inches long**
- **60 baguettes**  
  - Each baguette is **2 feet long**

We are asked to find the **total length in feet** when all baked goods are placed **end to end**.

---

### **Step 2: Convert all measurements to the same unit (feet)**

We'll convert everything to **feet**, since the final answer needs to be in feet.

- **1 foot = 12 inches**

#### Rolls:
- 4 inches = $ \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} $ feet
- 300 rolls → $ 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 $ feet

#### Croissants:
- 6 inches = $ \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} $ feet
- 120 croissants → $ 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 $ feet

#### Baguettes:
- 2 feet already (no conversion needed)
- 60 baguettes → $ 60 \times 2 = 120 $ feet

---

### **Step 3: Add up all the lengths**

- Rolls: 100 feet  
- Croissants: 60 feet  
- Baguettes: 120 feet  

Total length = $ 100 + 60 + 120 = \boxed{280} $ feet

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **280 feet**
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to last for **2 months**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the banana needs per month**

We are given:

- **Monkeys**: 200 bananas **per month**
- **Gorillas**: 400 bananas **per month**
- **Baboons**: 100 bananas **per month**

So, total banana requirement **per month** is:

$$
200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas/month}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate for 2 months**

Since the zookeeper orders bananas **every 2 months**, we need to calculate the total number of bananas needed for **2 months**:

$$
700 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{1400} \text{ bananas}
$$

The zookeeper needs to order **1400 bananas** to last for 2 months.
Let's break down the problem step by step to figure out how much farther the winner ran than the loser.

---

### **Understanding the Setup:**

- The football field is **100 yards long**.
- Blake runs **back and forth 15 times**.
- Kelly runs **once**, then changes her strategy:
  - She runs **to the 40-yard line and back** (i.e., 80 yards total per trip).
  - She does this **34 times**.

We need to calculate how far each person ran, and then find the difference.

---

### **Step 1: How far does Blake run?**

Blake runs **back and forth 15 times** across a 100-yard field.

- One full back-and-forth = 100 yards (to the end) + 100 yards (back) = **200 yards**
- So, 15 times = 15 × 200 = **3000 yards**

✅ **Blake runs 3000 yards.**

---

### **Step 2: How far does Kelly run?**

Kelly first runs **once** from one end of the field to the other (100 yards), then changes strategy.

Then she runs **to the 40-yard line and back**:

- From the starting line to the 40-yard line is **40 yards**.
- Then back to the start is another **40 yards**.
- So, one round trip = **80 yards**.

She does this **34 times**, so:

- 34 × 80 = **2720 yards**

But we also need to add the **first run** (from one end to the other):

- First run = **100 yards**

So total distance Kelly runs = 100 + 2720 = **2820 yards**

✅ **Kelly runs 2820 yards.**

---

### **Step 3: Who is the winner?**

- Blake: 3000 yards
- Kelly: 2820 yards

So, **Blake wins**.

---

### **Step 4: How much farther does the winner run than the loser?**

Difference = 3000 − 2820 = **180 yards**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: The winner (Blake) runs 180 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).**
Let's break down Raphael's purchases step by step to find the total amount he spent.

---

### 1. **Pens**
- He bought **4 pens**.
- Each pen costs **$1.50**.
- Total cost for pens:  
  $$
  4 \times 1.5 = 6
  $$

---

### 2. **Notebooks**
- He bought **2 notebooks**.
- Each notebook costs **$4**.
- Total cost for notebooks:  
  $$
  2 \times 4 = 8
  $$

---

### 3. **Bond Paper**
- He bought **1 rim of bond paper**.
- It costs **$20**.

---

### 4. **Total Cost**
Now, add up all the costs:

$$
6 \text{ (pens) } + 8 \text{ (notebooks) } + 20 \text{ (bond paper) } = 34
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Raphael spent **$34** in total.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Finn starts by watching 11 tadpoles** in the pond.

2. **Then he sees 6 of them come out of hiding** from under a lily pad.  
   - This means those 6 tadpoles are now visible, so they were previously hidden but are now seen.

3. **Then he sees 2 of them hide under a rock.**  
   - These 2 tadpoles are no longer visible, so they are now hidden again.

Now, let's calculate how many tadpoles Finn can see now:

- Start with 11 tadpoles.
- Add the 6 that came out of hiding:  
  $ 11 + 6 = 17 $
- Subtract the 2 that hid under a rock:  
  $ 17 - 2 = 15 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **15 tadpoles**  
Finn can see **15 tadpoles** in the pond now.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Depth on Monday**
The depth of the water on **Monday** is given as:

$$
\text{Depth on Monday} = 17 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Depth on Tuesday**
On **Tuesday**, the tank has **7 feet more water** than on Monday. So:

$$
\text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Depth on Wednesday**
On **Wednesday**, the depth is **two-thirds** of what it was on Tuesday. So:

$$
\text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{16} \text{ feet}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many **fish** Anakin and Locsin caught in total.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many of each type of fish Anakin caught

Anakin caught:
- **10 starfish**
- **6 sea horses**
- **3 clownfish**

So, the total number of **fish** Anakin caught is:

$$
10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \text{ fish}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many of each type of fish Locsin caught

Locsin caught:
- **5 fewer starfish than Anakin**:  
  $ 10 - 5 = 5 $ starfish

- **3 fewer sea horses than Anakin**:  
  $ 6 - 3 = 3 $ sea horses

- **2 more clownfish than Anakin**:  
  $ 3 + 2 = 5 $ clownfish

So, the total number of **fish** Locsin caught is:

$$
5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \text{ fish}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add both totals to get the total number of fish caught

$$
19 \text{ (Anakin)} + 13 \text{ (Locsin)} = 32 \text{ fish}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**They were able to catch 32 fish in total.**
We are given:

- **Original price of a bag of marbles** = $20  
- **Price increases by 20% every two months**  
- **Time period** = 36 months

---

### Step 1: Determine how many 2-month periods are in 36 months

$$
\frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ periods}
$$

So, the price increases **18 times**, each time by 20%.

---

### Step 2: Use the formula for compound interest (or growth)

The formula for the final price after repeated percentage increases is:

$$
P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^n
$$

Where:
- $ P_0 = 20 $ (original price)
- $ r = 0.20 $ (20% increase)
- $ n = 18 $ (number of periods)

$$
P = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} = 20 \times (1.20)^{18}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate $ (1.20)^{18} $

We can compute this using a calculator or logarithms.

$$
(1.20)^{18} \approx 11.4868
$$

---

### Step 4: Multiply by the original price

$$
P = 20 \times 11.4868 \approx 229.74
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{229.74}
$$

So, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months would be approximately **$229.74**.
We are given the following information:

- There are **5 red cars**, **3 action figures**, and **1 doll**.
- The **doll costs as much as 3 action figures**.
- A **red car costs $4**.
- An **action figure costs $5**.

We need to find the **total value of all the toys**.

---

### Step 1: Find the cost of the doll

The doll costs **as much as 3 action figures**.

Since an action figure costs **$5**, then:

$$
\text{Cost of doll} = 3 \times 5 = \$15
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the total cost of each type of toy

- **Red cars**: 5 cars × $4 per car = $20  
- **Action figures**: 3 action figures × $5 per figure = $15  
- **Doll**: 1 doll × $15 = $15

---

### Step 3: Add them all together

$$
\text{Total cost} = 20 + 15 + 15 = \$50
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{50}
$$

So, **all the toys are worth $50**.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much more money Jackie will have if she **hires the accountant** versus doing her taxes herself.

---

### **Option 1: Do Taxes Herself**

- She will miss **3 hours** of freelance work.
- She earns **$35/hour**.
- So, the **lost income** is:

$$
3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105
$$

So, if she does the taxes herself, she loses **$105** in income.

---

### **Option 2: Hire an Accountant**

- The accountant charges **$90**.

So, if she hires the accountant, she pays **$90** upfront.

---

### **Compare the Two Options**

- If she does it herself, she **loses $105**.
- If she hires the accountant, she **spends $90**.

So, the difference in cost between the two options is:

$$
\$105 - \$90 = \$15
$$

This means that **hiring the accountant saves her $15** compared to doing it herself.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Jackie will have $15 more if she hires the accountant.**
Let's calculate how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing after buying all the items.

### Step 1: Total budget
Elvira has a total budget of:

$$
€1500
$$

---

### Step 2: Cost of each item

- **Computer (screen, keyboard, mouse):** €1090  
- **Scanner:** €157  
- **CD burner:** €74  
- **Printer:** €102  

---

### Step 3: Add up the costs

$$
\text{Total cost} = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102
$$

Let’s add step by step:

- $ 1090 + 157 = 1247 $
- $ 1247 + 74 = 1321 $
- $ 1321 + 102 = 1423 $

So, the total cost is:

$$
€1423
$$

---

### Step 4: Subtract total cost from budget

$$
\text{Money left} = 1500 - 1423 = €77
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Elvira will have **€77** left for her clothing.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many eggs are needed for 15 flans
- Each Spanish flan requires **3 eggs**.
- So, for **15 flans**, Sandra needs:
  $$
  15 \text{ flans} \times 3 \text{ eggs per flan} = 45 \text{ eggs}
  $$

### Step 2: Determine how many eggs Sandra gets each time she babysits
- Sandra gets **9 eggs** every time she babysits.

### Step 3: Calculate how many times she needs to babysit to get 45 eggs
- To find the number of babysitting sessions, divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs per session:
  $$
  \frac{45 \text{ eggs}}{9 \text{ eggs per session}} = 5 \text{ sessions}
  $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Sandra has to babysit **5 times** to get enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans.
We are given:

- Seth is **twice as old as Brooke**.
- In **2 years**, the **sum of their ages will be 28**.

Let’s define variables and solve step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define Variables

Let:
- $ B $ = Brooke's current age
- $ S $ = Seth's current age

From the first statement:
$$
S = 2B
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the Second Statement

In 2 years:
- Brooke's age will be $ B + 2 $
- Seth's age will be $ S + 2 $

The sum of their ages in 2 years is 28:
$$
(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28
$$

Simplify:
$$
B + 2 + S + 2 = 28 \\
B + S + 4 = 28 \\
B + S = 24
$$

---

### Step 3: Substitute $ S = 2B $ into the Equation

$$
B + (2B) = 24 \\
3B = 24 \\
B = 8
$$

Now find Seth's age:
$$
S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Seth is 16 years old.**
We are given:

- **Ethel has $8.**
- **Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has.**

Let’s break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find twice the amount Ethel has

Ethel has $8, so:

$$
2 \times 8 = 16
$$

---

### Step 2: Add $2 to that amount

Jimmy has $2 more than that:

$$
16 + 2 = 18
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Jimmy has $18.**
Let's break this down step by step:

- **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**  
  Pancho walks **20 miles per day**.  
  There are **5 weekdays** in a week.  
  So, miles walked on weekdays = $ 20 \times 5 = 100 $ miles.

- **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**  
  Pancho walks **10 miles per day**.  
  There are **2 weekend days** in a week.  
  So, miles walked on weekends = $ 10 \times 2 = 20 $ miles.

- **Total miles in a week:**  
  $ 100 + 20 = 120 $ miles.

### ✅ Final Answer: **120 miles**.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find the **total cost of each uniform**.

---

### Step 1: Cost of the hat
We are told:
- The **hat costs $25**.

---

### Step 2: Cost of the jacket
We are told:
- The **jacket costs three times as much as the hat**.

So:
$$
\text{Jacket cost} = 3 \times \text{Hat cost} = 3 \times 25 = 75
$$

---

### Step 3: Cost of the pants
We are told:
- The **pants cost the average of the hat and jacket**.

To find the average, we add the hat and jacket costs and divide by 2:
$$
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Hat cost} + \text{Jacket cost}}{2} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
$$

So, the **pants cost $50**.

---

### Step 4: Total cost of the uniform
Now, add up the costs of all three items:
$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{Hat} + \text{Jacket} + \text{Pants} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{150}
$$

Each uniform costs **$150** in total.
Let's break this down step by step to find the **total number of legs** Jake sees in the museum.

---

### Step 1: Spiders
- Number of spiders: **80**
- Legs per spider: **8**

$$
\text{Total legs from spiders} = 80 \times 8 = 640
$$

---

### Step 2: Insects
- Number of insects: **90**
- Legs per insect: **6**

$$
\text{Total legs from insects} = 90 \times 6 = 540
$$

---

### Step 3: Rare mutant invertebrates
- Number of rare mutant invertebrates: **3**
- Legs per mutant: **10**

$$
\text{Total legs from mutants} = 3 \times 10 = 30
$$

---

### Step 4: Add all the legs together

$$
\text{Total legs} = 640 + 540 + 30 = \boxed{1210}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **1210 legs**
We are given a logic puzzle involving the ages of four birds: **Sally Two**, **Granny Red**, **Sally Four**, and **Sally Thirtytwo**. The goal is to find the **total age of the four birds**.

---

### Step 1: Assign Variables

Let’s define the ages:

- Let $ S_2 $ = Sally Two's age  
- Let $ G $ = Granny Red's age  
- Let $ S_4 $ = Sally Four's age  
- Let $ S_{32} $ = Sally Thirtytwo's age  

---

### Step 2: Use Given Information

From the problem:

1. **Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red**  
   → $ S_2 = G + 3 $

2. **Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four**  
   → $ G = 2 \times S_4 $

3. **Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo**  
   → $ S_4 = S_{32} $

4. **Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old**  
   → $ S_{32} = 8 $

---

### Step 3: Plug in Known Values

From (4):  
$ S_{32} = 8 $, so  
$ S_4 = 8 $ (from 3)

Now use (2):  
$ G = 2 \times S_4 = 2 \times 8 = 16 $

Now use (1):  
$ S_2 = G + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19 $

---

### Step 4: Find Total Age

Now we have all four ages:

- Sally Two: 19  
- Granny Red: 16  
- Sally Four: 8  
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8  

Add them up:

$$
19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**The total age of the four birds is 51 years.**
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much Jessica will pay in a year if she pays **50% more than the minimum** on all her debts.

---

### Step 1: Find the **minimum monthly payments** for each debt

- **Student loans**: $300/month  
- **Credit card**: $200/month  
- **Mortgage**: $500/month  

**Total minimum monthly payment** =  
$300 + $200 + $500 = **$1,000/month**

---

### Step 2: Calculate 50% more than the minimum

50% of $1,000 = 0.5 × $1,000 = **$500**

So, 50% more than the minimum is:  
$1,000 + $500 = **$1,500/month**

---

### Step 3: Multiply by 12 to get the **annual total**

$1,500/month × 12 months = **$18,000/year**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Jessica would pay **$18,000 per year** if she pays 50% more than the minimum on all her debts.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how long it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the time per potato**

- **Peeling a potato:** 1 minute and 30 seconds = **90 seconds**
- **Cutting a potato:** 5 seconds

So, **total time per potato** is:

$$
90 \text{ seconds (peel)} + 5 \text{ seconds (cut)} = 95 \text{ seconds per potato}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Total time for 60 potatoes**

$$
60 \text{ potatoes} \times 95 \text{ seconds per potato} = 5700 \text{ seconds}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Convert seconds to minutes**

$$
5700 \text{ seconds} \div 60 = 95 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: It will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- **Cost of lemons per gallon:** $3  
- **Cost of sugar per gallon:** $2  
- **Selling price per glass:** $0.50  
- **Glasses per gallon:** 20  
- **Total profit:** $25  

We are asked to find: **How much they spent on lemons?**

---

### **Step 1: Find the cost per glass**

They make **20 glasses per gallon**, and the **cost per gallon is**:

$$
\text{Cost per gallon} = \text{Cost of lemons} + \text{Cost of sugar} = 3 + 2 = 5 \text{ dollars}
$$

So, the **cost per glass** is:

$$
\frac{\text{Cost per gallon}}{\text{Glasses per gallon}} = \frac{5}{20} = 0.25 \text{ dollars per glass}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the profit per glass**

They sell each glass for $0.50 and it costs them $0.25 to make it.

$$
\text{Profit per glass} = 0.50 - 0.25 = 0.25 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the number of glasses sold**

They made a total profit of $25. Since each glass gives a $0.25 profit:

$$
\text{Number of glasses sold} = \frac{25}{0.25} = 100 \text{ glasses}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Find how many gallons they used**

Since they get **20 glasses per gallon**:

$$
\text{Gallons used} = \frac{100}{20} = 5 \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Find total cost of lemons**

$$
\text{Cost of lemons} = 5 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 15 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{15}
$$

They spent **$15** on lemons.
We are given the following information:

- Total number of **Asians** in the race: **240**
- Number of **Japanese** Asians: **80**
- The rest are **Chinese** Asians.
- Number of **boys** on the Chinese team: **60**
- We are to find the number of **girls** on the Chinese team.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of Chinese Asians

Total Asians = 240  
Japanese = 80  
So, Chinese = Total - Japanese  
$$
\text{Chinese} = 240 - 80 = 160
$$

So, there are **160 Chinese** Asians in total.

---

### Step 2: Use the information about boys and girls

We are told that **60 of the Chinese team are boys**, so the rest must be **girls**.

$$
\text{Number of girls} = \text{Total Chinese} - \text{Number of boys}
$$
$$
\text{Number of girls} = 160 - 60 = 100
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{100}
$$
We are given that Zaid earns **$6000 per month** and spends money on various things. Let's go step by step to find out how much he has left after all the expenses.

---

### Step 1: Calculate rent
Zaid spends **1/4 of his salary** on rent.

$$
\text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500
$$

Remaining amount after rent:

$$
6000 - 1500 = 4500
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate car fuel
He spends **1/3 of his salary** on car fuel.

$$
\text{Car fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000
$$

Remaining amount after car fuel:

$$
6000 - 2000 = 4000
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate remaining after rent and car fuel
From above, after paying for rent and car fuel, the total spent is:

$$
1500 + 2000 = 3500
$$

So, the remaining amount is:

$$
6000 - 3500 = 2500
$$

---

### Step 4: Donates half of the remaining to charity
He donates **half of the remaining $2500** to charity.

$$
\text{Charity donation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250
$$

Remaining after donation:

$$
2500 - 1250 = 1250
$$

---

### Step 5: Give daughter and wife money
- Daughter gets **$200**
- Wife gets **$700**

Total given to family:

$$
200 + 700 = 900
$$

Remaining after giving to family:

$$
1250 - 900 = 350
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{350}
$$

Zaid will have **$350** left after all the expenses and donations.
We are given the following information:

- Bo has **40 crabs**.
- Monic has **4 fewer crabs than Bo**.
- Rani has **10 more crabs than Monic**.

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find how many crabs Monic has

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo:

$$
\text{Monic's crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many crabs Rani has

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic:

$$
\text{Rani's crabs} = \text{Monic's crabs} + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46
$$

---

### Step 3: Add up all the crabs

$$
\text{Total crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs}
$$
$$
= 40 + 36 + 46 = 122
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{122}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Earnings per hour**: $10  
2. **First week**: 5 hours  
   - Earnings for the first week = $10/hour × 5 hours = **$50**  
3. **Second week**: 8 hours  
   - Earnings for the second week = $10/hour × 8 hours = **$80**  

Now, add the earnings from both weeks:

$$
\$50 + \$80 = \$130
$$

### Final Answer: **\$130**
We are given:

- Total number of students who voted = **80**
- The winner got **3/4** of the votes.
- We need to find the number of votes the **loser** got.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of votes the winner got

The winner got $ \frac{3}{4} $ of the total votes:

$$
\text{Winner's votes} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the number of votes the loser got

Since the total number of votes is 80, and the winner got 60, the loser must have gotten:

$$
\text{Loser's votes} = 80 - 60 = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{20}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many **red roses** Fred must deliver by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.

---

### Step 1: Define Variables

Let’s define:

- Let $ w $ = number of **white carnations** ordered.
- Then, the number of **red roses** is **4 times** the number of white carnations:  
  $ r = 4w $
- The number of **pink calla lilies** is given as **200**, and it's also stated that this is **five times** the number of white carnations:  
  $ 200 = 5w $

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ w $

From the equation:

$$
200 = 5w
$$

Divide both sides by 5:

$$
w = \frac{200}{5} = 40
$$

So, Sandra ordered **40 white carnations**.

---

### Step 3: Find the Number of Red Roses

We know:

$$
r = 4w = 4 \times 40 = 160
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Fred must deliver **160 red roses** by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business.
We are given the following information:

1. **Jean is two years older than Mark.**
2. **Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.**
3. **Jan is 30 years old.**

We are to find **Jean's current age**.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ J $ = Jean's current age
- $ M $ = Mark's current age
- $ N $ = Jan's current age = **30**

From the first statement:

$$
J = M + 2 \quad \text{(1)}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the second condition

"Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age."

So, **two years ago**, Mark's age was:

$$
M - 2
$$

And **two years ago**, Jan's age was:

$$
N - 2 = 30 - 2 = 28
$$

Now, "Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age" two years ago:

$$
M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(28) + 5
$$

Simplify the right-hand side:

$$
\frac{1}{2}(28) = 14 \\
14 + 5 = 19
$$

So:

$$
M - 2 = 19 \Rightarrow M = 21
$$

---

### Step 3: Find Jean's age

From equation (1):

$$
J = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Jean is 23 years old.**
We are given two track teams competing in a 4-lap (4 × 400m) relay race.

---

### **Team A (Well-rounded):**
- Each runner runs **400 meters** in **55 seconds**.
- So, the total time for the team is:
  $$
  4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
  $$

---

### **Team B (Less well-rounded):**
- First runner: **60 seconds**
- Second runner: **3 seconds faster** than the first → **57 seconds**
- Third runner: **3 seconds faster** than the second → **54 seconds**
- Fourth runner: **3 seconds faster** than the third → **51 seconds**

So, the total time for Team B is:
$$
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
$$

---

### **Difference in Time:**
$$
222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
$$

---

### ✅ **Answer:**
The **faster team (Team A)** will win by **2 seconds**.
We are given that Jerry is rolling a **six-sided die**, and we need to find how much more likely it is that he rolls a **number greater than 3** than that he rolls **two even numbers in a row**. We are to express this as a **percentage**.

---

### Step 1: Define the two events

- **Event A**: Rolling a number **greater than 3** on a single roll of a six-sided die.
- **Event B**: Rolling **two even numbers in a row** (i.e., two even numbers on two consecutive rolls).

We want to find:

> How much more likely is Event A than Event B?  
> That is, compute the **difference in probabilities**, then express that difference as a **percentage**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of each event

#### Event A: Rolling a number greater than 3

On a six-sided die, the numbers are:  
**1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6**

Numbers **greater than 3** are: **4, 5, 6** → 3 outcomes.

So,

$$
P(A) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
$$

---

#### Event B: Rolling two even numbers in a row

Even numbers on a six-sided die: **2, 4, 6** → 3 outcomes.

So, the probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:

$$
P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

Since the two rolls are independent:

$$
P(B) = P(\text{even on first roll}) \times P(\text{even on second roll}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the difference in probabilities

$$
\text{Difference} = P(A) - P(B) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25
$$

Now, convert this difference to a **percentage**:

$$
\text{Percentage} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{25\%}
$$

Jerry is **25% more likely** to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

**Step 1:**  
We are told that **Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom**.

**Step 2:**  
We are also told that **her mom got 20 apples**.

So, Jenna picked:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ apples}
$$

---

**Step 3:**  
Now, to find out how many apples **they both picked**, we add the number of apples Jenna picked and the number her mom picked:

$$
20 + 10 = 30
$$

---

**Final Answer:**  
They both picked **30 apples** in total.
We are given the following information:

- **Rats**:  
  - There are **3 cages** of rats, and each cage is in **equal groups**.  
  - Each rat gets **6 pieces of straw**.  
  - Let the number of **rats per cage** be **x**.  
  - So, total number of rats = **3x**.  
  - Total straw used for rats = **3x × 6 = 18x**.

- **Hamsters**:  
  - There are **10 cages**, and each cage has **1 hamster** (since they are kept alone).  
  - Each hamster gets **5 pieces of straw**.  
  - Total straw used for hamsters = **10 × 5 = 50**.

- **Rabbits**:  
  - There is **1 pen** of rabbits.  
  - Total straw used for rabbits = **20**.

- **Total straw used** = **160**.

---

### Step 1: Write the equation

$$
\text{Straw for rats} + \text{Straw for hamsters} + \text{Straw for rabbits} = 160
$$

$$
18x + 50 + 20 = 160
$$

$$
18x + 70 = 160
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for x

$$
18x = 160 - 70 = 90
$$

$$
x = \frac{90}{18} = 5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**There are 5 rats in each cage.**
Sure! Let's break this down step by step.

### Given:
- **Principal (P)** = $100  
- **Monthly interest rate** = 2%  
- **Time (t)** = 3 months

We are to calculate the **total amount Mandy owes after 3 months**, including compound interest.

---

### Step 1: Understand the interest type
The problem says "monthly interest of 2%", which is typically **compound interest** (interest is added each month on the new balance).

So, we will use the **compound interest formula**:

$$
A = P \times (1 + r)^t
$$

Where:
- $ A $ = final amount (what Mandy must pay)
- $ P $ = principal = $100
- $ r $ = monthly interest rate = 2% = 0.02
- $ t $ = time in months = 3

---

### Step 2: Plug in the values

$$
A = 100 \times (1 + 0.02)^3
$$
$$
A = 100 \times (1.02)^3
$$

Now compute $ (1.02)^3 $:

$$
(1.02)^3 = 1.061208
$$

So,

$$
A = 100 \times 1.061208 = 106.1208
$$

---

### Step 3: Final Answer

Mandy should give Benedict **$106.12** (rounded to the nearest cent).

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**$106.12**
We are given the following information:

- **Cost per bag**: $20 (from the farmer)
- **Transport cost per bag**: $2
- **Selling price per bag**: $30
- **Total profit**: $400

Let’s denote the number of bags sold as **x**.

---

### Step 1: Total cost per bag

Each bag costs:
$$
\text{Cost per bag} = 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars}
$$

So, total cost for **x** bags is:
$$
\text{Total cost} = 22x
$$

---

### Step 2: Total revenue from selling x bags

Each bag is sold for $30, so:
$$
\text{Total revenue} = 30x
$$

---

### Step 3: Profit is revenue minus cost

Profit is given as $400, so:
$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = 30x - 22x = 8x
$$

We know:
$$
8x = 400
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for x

$$
x = \frac{400}{8} = 50
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{50}
$$

The trader sold **50 bags**.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much **each of the three friends paid** in total.

---

### **Step 1: Cost of tickets**

They spent **$20.25** on **3 tickets**.

So, the cost per ticket is:

$$
\frac{20.25}{3} = 7.50 \text{ dollars per ticket}
$$

But we don't need that yet — we'll use the total cost for now.

---

### **Step 2: Cost of food**

They spent **$4.50 less** on food than on tickets.

So, the cost of food is:

$$
20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Cost of rides**

They went on **2 different rides**, each costing **$33**.

So, total cost for rides is:

$$
2 \times 33 = 66 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total cost**

Now, let's add up all the costs:

- Tickets: $20.25  
- Food: $15.75  
- Rides: $66  

Total cost:

$$
20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Split the cost evenly among 3 friends**

$$
\frac{102}{3} = 34 \text{ dollars per person}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Each friend paid $34.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find out how many peaches John collects per minute  
John collects **2 peaches per minute**.

---

### Step 2: Find out how many minutes he works  
He works for **3 hours**.  
Since there are **60 minutes in an hour**, we calculate:

$$
3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Multiply the number of minutes by the rate  
Now, multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches he collects per minute:

$$
180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**John collects 360 peaches.**
Sure! Let's solve this step by step.

10 \text{ ducks} \times 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} = 35 \text{ pounds/week}
$$

---

### Step 2: Convert weekly amount to daily amount.

There are 7 days in a week, so:

$$
\frac{35 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**5 pounds of insects per day** are needed for the flock of 10 ducks.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial number of trees**
Tom starts with **50 trees**.

---

### **Step 2: Net change per year**
- Tom **plants 10 trees** each year.
- He **chops down 2 trees** each year.
- So, the **net gain per year** is:

$$
10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Trees after 10 years (before any die)**
We start with 50 trees and add 8 trees per year for 10 years:

$$
\text{Total trees after 10 years} = 50 + (8 \times 10) = 50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
$$

---

### **Step 4: 30% of the trees die**
Now, **30% of the 130 trees die**. Let's calculate how many that is:

$$
0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Trees remaining after the 30% die**
Subtract the dead trees from the total:

$$
130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 91 trees** left.
Let's break down the problem step by step and calculate how many **pink** and **white** flamingos are out on Sue's front yard at **noon on Sunday**.

---

### **Friday Morning:**
- **18 pink plastic flamingos** are placed on Sue's front yard.

So, after Friday:
- **Pink:** 18  
- **White:** 0

---

### **Saturday Morning:**
- The neighbors **take back one third of the flamingos** (which are all pink at this point).
- One third of 18 is:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
$$

- So, they take back **6 pink flamingos**, **paint them white**, and **put them back**.

Now:
- **Pink remaining:** $18 - 6 = 12$
- **White added:** 6

So after Saturday:
- **Pink:** 12  
- **White:** 6

---

### **Sunday Morning:**
- The neighbors **add another 18 pink flamingos** to the collection.

Now:
- **Pink:** $12 + 18 = 30$  
- **White:** 6 (unchanged)

---

### **At Noon on Sunday:**
We are asked: **How many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos?**

So we subtract the number of white from the number of pink:

$$
30 - 6 = 24
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many crayons Violetta needs.
She wants **5 different colors**, and each color is a **crayon**, so she needs **5 crayons**.

### Step 2: Find the total cost of the crayons.
Each crayon costs **$2**, so:

$$
5 \text{ crayons} \times \$2 = \$10
$$

### Step 3: Calculate the change she will get.
Violetta has **$20**. After buying the crayons for $10, her change will be:

$$
\$20 - \$10 = \$10
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Violetta will get **$10** in change.
We are given the following information:

- A **pen** costs as much as a **pencil and eraser combined**.
- A **pencil** costs **$1.20**.
- An **eraser** costs **$0.30**.

---

### Step 1: Find the cost of one pen

Since a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined:

$$
\text{Cost of pen} = \text{Cost of pencil} + \text{Cost of eraser}
$$
$$
\text{Cost of pen} = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
$$

So, **one pen costs $1.50**.

---

### Step 2: Find the cost of 8 pens

$$
\text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{12.00}
$$

So, **8 pens will cost $12.00**.
We are given:

- Total carrots: **200 pounds**
- Number of restaurants: **40**
- Each restaurant is to receive **2 pounds** of carrots

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of carrots needed
Each restaurant gets 2 pounds, and there are 40 restaurants.

$$
\text{Total carrots needed} = 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ pounds}
$$

### Step 2: Subtract from the total available
We have 200 pounds of carrots, but only 80 pounds are needed.

$$
\text{Unused carrots} = 200 - 80 = 120 \text{ pounds}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**120 pounds of carrots will not be used.**
We are given the following information about the population of Soda:

- Total population = **23,786**
- Number of men = **8,417**
- Number of women = **9,092**

We are asked to find the number of **children**.

---

### Step 1: Add the number of men and women

$$
8,417 + 9,092 = 17,509
$$

So, there are **17,509 adults** (men + women).

---

### Step 2: Subtract this from the total population to find the number of children

$$
23,786 - 17,509 = 6,277
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

There are **6,277 children** in Soda.
Let's break down the problem step by step and calculate how many Pokémon cards Elaine has in total.

---

### **Step 1: Initial number of cards**
Elaine starts with:
$$
20 \text{ cards}
$$

---

### **Step 2: First month**
She collects **three times** the initial number of cards:
$$
3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
$$

So, after the first month, she has:
$$
20 + 60 = 80 \text{ cards}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Second month**
She collects **20 fewer** cards than she collected in the first month:
$$
60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
$$

So, after the second month, she has:
$$
80 + 40 = 120 \text{ cards}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Third month**
She collects **twice the combined number** of cards from the first and second months.

First, find the total from the first and second months:
$$
60 + 40 = 100 \text{ cards}
$$

Now, she collects twice that amount:
$$
2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
$$

So, after the third month, she has:
$$
120 + 200 = 320 \text{ cards}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{320}
$$

Elaine now has **320 Pokémon cards** in total.
We are given the following information:

- Mark edits **1000 sentences each week**.
- He edits an **equal number of sentences for each publisher**.
- Publisher **A pays 5 cents per sentence**.
- Publisher **B pays twice what Publisher A pays**, so **Publisher B pays 10 cents per sentence**.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher

Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, and he edits a total of 1000 sentences:

$$
\text{Sentences per publisher} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500
$$

So, Mark edits **500 sentences for Publisher A** and **500 sentences for Publisher B**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate earnings from each publisher

- **Publisher A**:  
  $$
  500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
  $$

- **Publisher B**:  
  $$
  500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Add the earnings from both publishers

$$
2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{7500} \text{ cents}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Pails of water per day:**
   - Morning: 5 pails
   - Afternoon: 6 pails  
   - Total pails per day = 5 + 6 = **11 pails**

2. **Water per pail:**  
   Each pail contains **5 liters** of water.

3. **Total water per day:**  
   Total liters = Number of pails × Liters per pail  
   = 11 pails × 5 liters/pail = **55 liters**

### ✅ Final Answer: **55 liters** of water per day.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much **John made that year**.

---

### **Given:**

- **Award:**
  - **One-time monetary reward:** $5,000
  - **5% raise in salary**

- **Original weekly salary:** $2,000

- **He got the award on the first day of the year**, so the raise and the one-time reward are included in the year's total earnings.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the new weekly salary after the 5% raise**

A 5% raise on $2,000:

$$
\text{Raise amount} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100
$$

$$
\text{New weekly salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total earnings from salary for the year**

Assuming a standard year with 52 weeks:

$$
\text{Total salary} = 2100 \times 52 = 109,200
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add the one-time award**

$$
\text{Total earnings for the year} = 109,200 + 5,000 = 114,200
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{114,200}
$$

John made **$114,200** that year.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total acres of the farm**: 10 acres  
2. **Grapes produced per acre per year**: 5 tons  
3. **Wine barrels produced per ton of grapes**: 2 barrels

---

### Step 1: Calculate total grape production per year

$$
\text{Total grape production} = \text{Acres} \times \text{Grapes per acre} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ tons}
$$

---

### Step 2: Convert grape production to wine barrels

$$
\text{Total wine barrels} = \text{Total grape tons} \times \text{Barrels per ton} = 50 \times 2 = 100 \text{ barrels}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**100 barrels of wine per year**.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out **how many slices of cheese Carl used in total** during the week.

---

### **Step 1: Sandwiches for lunch**
- Carl ate **1 sandwich per day** for **7 days**.
- Each sandwich uses **2 slices of cheese**.

So, total cheese from sandwiches:

$$
7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Omelets for breakfast**
- Carl had **3 days** of omelets for breakfast.
- Each omelet used **1 more slice of cheese than a sandwich**.
- A sandwich uses **2 slices**, so an omelet uses **3 slices**.

So, total cheese from omelets:

$$
3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Macaroni and cheese dish**
- He made **1 big dish of macaroni and cheese**.
- It used **8 slices of cheese**.

---

### **Step 4: Total cheese used**

Now, add up all the cheese used:

- Sandwiches: **14 slices**
- Omelets: **9 slices**
- Macaroni and cheese: **8 slices**

$$
14 + 9 + 8 = \boxed{31} \text{ slices}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Carl used a total of 31 slices of cheese during the week.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many **pens** Janet has now.

---

### **Step 1: Count the pens she already had**

- **Green pens:** 22  
- **Yellow pens:** 10  

So, total pens before buying new ones:

$$
22 + 10 = 32 \text{ pens}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Count the pens she bought in bags**

She bought:

- **6 bags of blue pens**, with **9 pens per bag**  
  $$
  6 \times 9 = 54 \text{ blue pens}
  $$

- **2 bags of red pens**, with **6 pens per bag**  
  $$
  2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ red pens}
  $$

So, total new pens:

$$
54 + 12 = 66 \text{ pens}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add all the pens together**

- Original pens: 32  
- New pens: 66  

$$
32 + 66 = 98 \text{ pens}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Janet now has **98 pens**.
We are given that Brinley has taken **five tests** so far, with the following scores:

- 89  
- 71  
- 92  
- 100  
- 86  

She will take a **sixth test**, and **Mr. Bert allows her to drop the lowest score** when calculating the final average.

We want to find out what she needs to score on the **sixth test** so that her **final average is 93** (after dropping the lowest score).

---

### Step 1: Find the current total of the first five tests

$$
89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
$$

---

### Step 2: Let the sixth test score be $ x $

Then the total of all six test scores is:

$$
438 + x
$$

Now, Mr. Bert allows her to **drop the lowest score** when computing the average.

So we need to **find the lowest score among the six**, then compute the average of the remaining five.

But since we don't yet know $ x $, we have to consider **what the lowest score could be** depending on the value of $ x $.

Let’s analyze possible cases:

---

### Case 1: The lowest score is still 71 (the original lowest)

This would happen if $ x \geq 71 $.

Then the five highest scores would be:

- 89  
- 92  
- 100  
- 86  
- 71 (if it's not dropped) → but wait, we're dropping the **lowest**, so 71 would be dropped.

Wait — actually, in this case, if **71 is the lowest**, then it would be dropped, and the five scores used for the average would be:

- 89  
- 92  
- 100  
- 86  
- $ x $ (if $ x $ is higher than 71)

So the total of the five scores used is:

$$
89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + x = 367 + x
$$

We want the average of these five to be **93**:

$$
\frac{367 + x}{5} = 93
$$

Multiply both sides by 5:

$$
367 + x = 465
$$

Subtract 367:

$$
x = 465 - 367 = 98
$$

So if the lowest score is **71**, then Brinley needs to score **98** on the sixth test.

---

### Case 2: What if $ x < 71 $? Then the lowest score would be $ x $, and the five scores used would be:

- 89  
- 92  
- 100  
- 86  
- 71

So the total is:

$$
89 + 92 + 100 + 86 + 71 = 438
$$

Average is:

$$
\frac{438}{5} = 87.6
$$

That’s way below 93, so **this case is not valid**.

---

### Conclusion:

The only valid scenario is **Case 1**, where the lowest score is **71**, and the sixth test score is **98**.

So, Brinley needs to score **98** on the sixth test to get an average of **93** after dropping the lowest score.

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **98**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **First Period:**
- **Rides per week:** 5 times  
- **Distance per ride:** 25 km  
- **Weeks:** 4 weeks  

**Total distance in this period:**

$$
5 \text{ rides/week} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 500 \text{ km}
$$

---

### **Second Period:**
- **Rides per week:** 2 times  
- **Distance per ride:** 60 km  
- **Weeks:** 3 weeks  

**Total distance in this period:**

$$
2 \text{ rides/week} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ km}
$$

---

### **Total Distance:**

$$
500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = \boxed{860} \text{ km}
$$

### ✅ **Answer: 860 kilometers**
We are given the following information:

- Joe's bag has **25 chocolate bars** and **80 candied apples**.
- Each **chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple**.
- Each **chocolate bar weighs 40g**.

---

### Step 1: Find the weight of one candied apple

Since each chocolate bar weighs **twice as much as a candied apple**, and each chocolate bar is **40g**, then:

$$
\text{Weight of one candied apple} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate total weight of all chocolate bars

$$
\text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 = 1000 \text{ grams}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate total weight of all candied apples

$$
\text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 = 1600 \text{ grams}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add both weights to get total weight of the bag

$$
\text{Total weight of the bag} = 1000 + 1600 = \boxed{2600} \text{ grams}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **2600 grams**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Monday:**
Rose bought **4 cakes**.

---

### **Tuesday:**
She bought **three times** the number of cakes she bought on Monday.

$$
3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ cakes}
$$

---

### **Wednesday:**
She bought **five times** the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.

$$
5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ cakes}
$$

---

### **Total number of cakes over three days:**

$$
4 \text{ (Monday)} + 12 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 60 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 76 \text{ cakes}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 76 cakes**.
We are given the following information:

- **Twenty dozen cups** cost **$1200 less** than the total cost of **half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each**.
- We are to find the **total cost of buying each cup**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the quantities and costs

- **One dozen = 12 items**, so:
  - **Twenty dozen cups = 20 × 12 = 240 cups**
  - **Half a dozen plates = 6 plates**

- Each plate is sold at **$6000**, so:
  - Total cost of 6 plates = 6 × 6000 = **$36,000**

---

### Step 2: Use the relationship between the two costs

We are told that:

> The cost of **240 cups** is **$1200 less** than the cost of **6 plates**.

So:

$$
\text{Cost of 240 cups} = \text{Cost of 6 plates} - 1200
$$

Substitute the known value:

$$
\text{Cost of 240 cups} = 36,000 - 1200 = 34,800
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the cost per cup

Now we divide the total cost of 240 cups by 240 to get the **cost per cup**:

$$
\text{Cost per cup} = \frac{34,800}{240}
$$

$$
\text{Cost per cup} = 145
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{145}
$$

The **total cost of buying each cup is $145**.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many times Sara must mow the lawn in order to afford the jacket and shoes.

---

### **Step 1: Total Cost of the Items**

- **Jacket**: $30  
- **Shoes**: 2 pairs × $20 = $40  

**Total cost** = $30 + $40 = **$70**

---

### **Step 2: How Much Sara Already Has**

Sara already has **$10** saved.

So, she needs **$70 - $10 = $60** more.

---

### **Step 3: Earnings from Babysitting**

She babysits **4 times**, earning **$5 each time**:

- 4 × $5 = **$20**

So, from babysitting, she earns **$20**.

---

### **Step 4: Remaining Amount Needed After Babysitting**

She already has **$10** and earns **$20** from babysitting:

- Total so far = $10 + $20 = **$30**

So, she still needs **$70 - $30 = $40** more.

---

### **Step 5: Earnings from Mowing the Lawn**

She earns **$4 per time** she mows the lawn.

We need to find how many times she needs to mow the lawn to earn **$40**.

$$
\text{Number of times} = \frac{40}{4} = 8
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Sara must mow the lawn **8 times** before she can afford the jacket and shoes.
We are given the following information:

- **Red chickens** produce **3 eggs per day**.
- **White chickens** produce **5 eggs per day**.
- Jerry collects **42 eggs per day**.
- He has **two more white chickens than red chickens**.

Let’s define variables:

Let:
- $ r $ = number of **red chickens**
- $ w $ = number of **white chickens**

From the problem:

1. $ w = r + 2 $ (he has two more white chickens than red)
2. Total eggs per day:  
   $$
   3r + 5w = 42
   $$

Now substitute $ w = r + 2 $ into the second equation:

$$
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
$$

Simplify:

$$
3r + 5r + 10 = 42 \\
8r + 10 = 42 \\
8r = 32 \\
r = 4
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: Jerry has **4 red chickens**.
We are told that Gary walks **around the edge** of a rectangular park that measures **1.5 miles by 6 miles**, and he walks at a speed of **3 miles per hour**.

---

### Step 1: Find the perimeter of the park

The park is a rectangle, so its **perimeter** is given by:

$$
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles}
$$

So, Gary walks **15 miles** in total.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the time spent walking

He walks at a speed of **3 miles per hour**, so the time it takes to walk 15 miles is:

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{5} \text{ hours}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Day 1:**
Sloane counts **100 customers**.

---

### **Day 2:**
She counts **50 more customers than the first day**, so:

$$
100 + 50 = 150 \text{ customers}
$$

---

### **Total by Day 3:**
The total number of customers over the three days is **500**.

So, the number of customers on **Day 3** is:

$$
500 - (\text{Day 1} + \text{Day 2}) = 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{250}
$$

Sloane counted **250 customers** on the third day.
We are told:

- Both pools **leak at 4 gallons per minute**.
- **4 minutes ago**, the **big pool had twice as much water as the small pool**.
- **Now**, the **big pool has four times as much water as the small pool**.
- We are to find **how much water the small pool has now**.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s define:

- Let $ S $ be the amount of water in the **small pool now** (in gallons).
- Let $ B $ be the amount of water in the **big pool now** (in gallons).

We are given that **now**, the big pool has **four times** as much water as the small pool:

$$
B = 4S \tag{1}
$$

---

### Step 2: Consider what happened 4 minutes ago

Since both pools leak at **4 gallons per minute**, in the past 4 minutes, each pool has lost:

$$
4 \text{ minutes} \times 4 \text{ gallons/minute} = 16 \text{ gallons}
$$

So, **4 minutes ago**, the amounts of water in the pools were:

- Small pool: $ S + 16 $
- Big pool: $ B + 16 $

And we're told that **4 minutes ago**, the big pool had **twice** as much water as the small pool:

$$
B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \tag{2}
$$

---

### Step 3: Substitute equation (1) into equation (2)

From (1): $ B = 4S $

Substitute into (2):

$$
4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
$$

Simplify the right-hand side:

$$
4S + 16 = 2S + 32
$$

Now solve for $ S $:

$$
4S - 2S = 32 - 16 \\
2S = 16 \\
S = 8
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

The **small pool now has** $\boxed{8}$ gallons of water.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Find the total cost of the items Lori wants to buy.
- Shoes: $320.00  
- Belt: $32.00  

Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00 = **$352.00**

---

### Step 2: Determine how much Lori earns per hour.
She earns **$8.00 per hour**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate how many hours she needs to work to earn $352.00.

$$
\text{Hours needed} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Earnings per hour}} = \frac{352}{8}
$$

$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Lori will need to work **44 hours** to afford the shoes and belt.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the total amount Janeth needs to repay**

Janeth borrowed **$2000** and promised to return it with an **additional 10% of the amount**.

So, the total repayment amount is:

$$
\text{Total Repayment} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
$$

$$
\text{Interest} = 10\% \text{ of } 2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = 200
$$

$$
\text{Total Repayment} = 2000 + 200 = 2200
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how much Janeth pays in total over 12 months**

She pays **$165 per month for 12 months**:

$$
\text{Total Paid} = 165 \times 12 = 1980
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the remaining balance**

Now subtract the total amount paid from the total repayment:

$$
\text{Remaining Balance} = \text{Total Repayment} - \text{Total Paid}
$$

$$
\text{Remaining Balance} = 2200 - 1980 = 220
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $220**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are told:

- There are **4 roses** in the vase.
- There are **7 more dahlias than roses** in the vase.

### Step 1: Find the number of dahlias
Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses:

$$
\text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 7 = 11
$$

### Step 2: Find the total number of flowers
Now add the number of roses and dahlias:

$$
\text{Total flowers} = \text{roses} + \text{dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{15}

We are given the following information:

- **Harriet is 21 years old now.**
- **Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age.**
- **Harriet is half the age of Zack.**

We are to calculate the **average age of the three in three years**.

---

### Step 1: Find Adrian's current age

Adrian's age = 3 × Harriet's age  
= 3 × 21 = **63 years**

---

### Step 2: Find Zack's current age

Harriet is half the age of Zack → Zack = 2 × Harriet  
= 2 × 21 = **42 years**

---

### Step 3: Find their ages in 3 years

- **Harriet:** 21 + 3 = **24**
- **Adrian:** 63 + 3 = **66**
- **Zack:** 42 + 3 = **45**

---

### Step 4: Calculate the average age in 3 years

$$
\text{Average age} = \frac{24 + 66 + 45}{3} = \frac{135}{3} = \boxed{45}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **45 years**
We are given the following information:

- **Total points scored by 4 students**: 251
- **Naomi scored**: 68 points
- **Yuri scored**: 10 more than half as many points as Naomi
- **Brianna scored**: 17 points more than Naomi
- We need to find **Jojo's score**

---

### Step 1: Find Yuri's score

Yuri scored **10 more than half of Naomi's score**.

Naomi's score = 68  
Half of Naomi's score = $ \frac{68}{2} = 34 $  
Yuri's score = $ 34 + 10 = 44 $

So, **Yuri = 44**

---

### Step 2: Find Brianna's score

Brianna scored **17 more than Naomi**.

Naomi's score = 68  
Brianna's score = $ 68 + 17 = 85 $

So, **Brianna = 85**

---

### Step 3: Add up known scores

Now we have:

- Naomi = 68  
- Yuri = 44  
- Brianna = 85  

Total of these three = $ 68 + 44 + 85 = 197 $

---

### Step 4: Find Jojo's score

Total points scored by all 4 students = 251  
So, Jojo's score = $ 251 - 197 = 54 $

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Jojo scored 54 points.**

### **Step 1: Initial amount of water in the tank**

The tank starts with:

$$
120 \text{ liters}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Water used to water the garden**

Celine uses:

$$
90 \text{ liters}
$$

So, the amount of water left in the tank after watering is:

$$
120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Rainwater collected**

She collects **rainwater that is twice as much as what was left** in the tank.

What was left in the tank was **30 liters**, so the rainwater she collects is:

$$
2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ liters}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total water in the tank now**

Now, the total water in the tank is the original leftover (30 liters) plus the rainwater (60 liters):

$$
30 + 60 = 90 \text{ liters}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{90} \text{ liters}

### **Step 1: Initial counts**

- Fire type: **30**
- Grass type: **20**
- Water type: **40**

---

### **Step 2: Changes in the number of cards**

- James **loses 8 water type** cards:
  - New water count = 40 - 8 = **32**
- He **buys 14 grass type** cards:
  - New grass count = 20 + 14 = **34**

---

### **Step 3: Total number of cards now**

- Fire: 30  
- Grass: 34  
- Water: 32  

Total = 30 + 34 + 32 = **96**

---

### **Step 4: Percentage of water type cards**

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Water cards}}{\text{Total cards}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100
$$

$$
\frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333
$$

$$
0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\%
$$

---

### **Step 5: Round to the nearest integer**

$$
33.33\% \rightarrow \boxed{33\%}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 33%**

$5.00

---

### **Amount still owed:**  
$14.00 - $5.00 = **$9.00**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $9.00**
We are given:

- Total puzzle pieces: **360**
- Kalinda's rate: **4 pieces per minute**
- Her mom's rate: **half as many as Kalinda**, so **2 pieces per minute**

### Step 1: Find their combined rate
Kalinda: 4 pieces/minute  
Mom: 2 pieces/minute  
**Combined rate = 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute**

### Step 2: Time to complete the puzzle
Total pieces = 360  
Rate = 6 pieces/minute  
Time = Total / Rate = 360 / 6 = **60 minutes**

### Step 3: Convert minutes to hours

### **Step 1: Total number of watermelons**
The farm produced:

$$
120 \text{ baby watermelons}
$$

---

### **Step 2: First harvest (after 2 months)**
Ashlyn found that **30%** of the watermelons were ready for harvest.

So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest at this point is:

$$
30\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \text{ watermelons}
$$

So, she took **36** watermelons home.

That leaves:

$$
120 - 36 = 84 \text{ watermelons remaining}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Second harvest (two weeks later)**
At this point, **3/4** of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest.

So, the number of watermelons ready for harvest now is:

$$
\frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \text{ watermelons}
$$

She harvested those 63 watermelons.

That leaves:

$$
84 - 63 = 21 \text{ watermelons not ready for harvest}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{21}
$$

**21 watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Total cost of the cars**

Mark buys **12 cars**, and each car costs **$20,000**.

$$
\text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Tax on the cars**

He pays **10% tax** on the total cost of the cars.

$$
\text{Tax} = 10\% \times 240,000 = 0.10 \times 240,000 = 24,000
$$

---

### **Step 3: Registration fees**

He pays **$1,000 registration fee** for **each car**.

$$
\text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total amount paid**

Now, add up all the costs:

- Cost of cars: $240,000  
- Tax: $24,000  
- Registration: $12,000  

$$
\text{Total cost} = 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $276,000**

### Step 1: Determine how many shells Kylie collected on Monday

We are told:

- **Robert collects 20 shells on Monday.**
- **Kylie collects 5 more shells than Robert on Monday.**

So, Kylie's shells on Monday =  
$$
20 + 5 = 25 \text{ shells}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday

We are told:

- **On Tuesday, Kylie collects 2 times more shells than she did on Monday.**

This means:
$$
\text{Shells on Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Shells on Monday} = 2 \times 25 = 50
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **We are told** that Dax found **half as many bugs as ants** in the garden.
2. **There were 50 ants** in the garden.
3. So, the number of **bugs** is half the number of ants:
   $$
   \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   $$
4. Now, we need to find the **total number of insects** in the garden. Insects include both **ants** and **bugs**.
5. So, total insects = number of ants + number of bugs:
   $$
   \text{Total insects} = 50 + 25 = 75
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **75 insects** in the garden.
Let's solve this step by step.

We are told:

- There are **36 penguins** sunbathing in the snow.
- **One-third** of them jump in and swim in the ocean.
- **Another one-third** go inside the cave to eat their dinner.

We need to find how many penguins are **still left sunbathing**.

---

### Step 1: Find one-third of 36

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
$$

So, **12 penguins** jump in the ocean.

---

### Step 2: Another one-third go into the cave

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
$$

So, **another 12 penguins** go into the cave.

---

### Step 3: Total number of penguins that left

$$
12 + 12 = 24
$$

---

### Step 4: Subtract from the original total

$$
36 - 24 = 12
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**12 penguins** are still left sunbathing.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many tomatoes Steve eats per week**

Steve eats **6 tomatoes per day**.

There are **7 days in a week**, so:

$$
6 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ tomatoes/week}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many tomatoes one vine produces per week**

The problem says:

> "A vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week."

So, **1 vine = 3 tomatoes/week**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how many vines are needed to get 42 tomatoes per week**

We need to find how many vines are required to produce **42 tomatoes per week**, given that each vine produces **3 tomatoes per week**.

$$
\frac{42 \text{ tomatoes}}{3 \text{ tomatoes/vine}} = 14 \text{ vines}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Steve needs 14 vines.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of slices needed

John has **20 friends**, and he wants each friend to have **4 slices**.

$$
\text{Total slices needed} = 20 \times 4 = 80 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many slices are in one pizza

Each pizza is sliced into **8 portions**, so:

$$
\text{Slices per pizza} = 8
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate how many pizzas are needed

To find out how many pizzas John needs to order, divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:

$$
\text{Number of pizzas} = \frac{80}{8} = 10
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{10}
$$

John needs to order **10 pizzas**.
We are told:

- Ram uses **5 empty pens** to make **1 new full pen**.
- He starts with **25 pens**.
- He uses them until the ink runs out, and **reuses** the empty ones to make more pens.

We need to find how many **total pens** he ends up with.

---

### Step 1: Initial pens
He starts with **25 pens**.

Let’s track the process step by step.

---

### Step 2: First round of usage

He uses the 25 pens. After using them, he has **25 empty pens**.

Now, he can make:
$$
\left\lfloor \frac{25}{5} \right\rfloor = 5 \text{ new pens}
$$

So now he has:
- 5 new pens (from the 25 empty ones)
- 0 pens left from the original 25 (they were used up)

Total pens so far: **5**

---

### Step 3: Second round

Now he uses those 5 pens. After using them, he has **5 empty pens**.

He can make:
$$
\left\lfloor \frac{5}{5} \right\rfloor = 1 \text{ new pen}
$$

Now he has:
- 1 new pen (from the 5 empty ones)
- 0 pens left from the previous 5 (they were used up)

Total pens so far: **5 + 1 = 6**

---

### Step 4: Third round

He uses that 1 pen. After using it, he has **1 empty pen**.

He can’t make any more pens because he needs 5 empty pens to make 1 new one.

So the process stops here.

---

### Final total:

From the initial 25 pens, he gets:
- 5 new pens from the first 25
- 1 new pen from the next 5
- No more pens from the 1 empty pen

So total pens:
$$
25 \text{ (original)} + 5 + 1 = \boxed{31}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **31 pens**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial Allowance**: Johnny starts with **$20**.
2. **Added Money**: He adds an extra **$10**, so the total amount he has is:
   $$
   20 + 10 = 30
   $$
3. **Investment Growth**: He invests this **$30**, and it **triples** in a year.

To find out how much money he has after a year, we multiply the initial investment by 3:
$$
30 \times 3 = 90
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$90**.
We are given the following information:

- **Jessa is 20 years old.**
- **Joan is five years older than Jessa.**
- **Mary is two years younger than Joan.**

We are asked to find the **sum of the ages** of Mary, Joan, and Jessa.

---

### Step 1: Find Joan's age

Joan is **five years older than Jessa**, and Jessa is **20 years old**.

$$
\text{Joan's age} = 20 + 5 = 25
$$

---

### Step 2: Find Mary's age

Mary is **two years younger than Joan**.

$$
\text{Mary's age} = 25 - 2 = 23
$$

---

### Step 3: Add all three ages together

$$
\text{Sum of ages} = \text{Jessa} + \text{Joan} + \text{Mary} = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{68}
$$
We are given:

- Total number of students in the hall = **1000**
- 30% of the students left through **exit A**
- Then, **3/5** of the **remaining** students left through **exit B**
- The rest left through **exit C**

We need to find how many students left through **exit C**.

---

### Step 1: Students leaving through exit A

30% of 1000 =  
$$
0.30 \times 1000 = 300
$$

So, **300 students** left through **exit A**.

---

### Step 2: Remaining students after exit A

Total students - students who left through A =  
$$
1000 - 300 = 700
$$

---

### Step 3: Students leaving through exit B

3/5 of the remaining 700 students left through **exit B**:

$$
\frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
$$

So, **420 students** left through **exit B**.

---

### Step 4: Remaining students (those who went through exit C)

Remaining students = total students - students who left through A and B:

$$
1000 - 300 - 420 = 280
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{280}
$$

**280 students went out through exit C.**
We are given the following information:

- **James has 6 more candies than Robert.**
- **John has twice as many candies as Robert.**
- **John has 54 candies.**

We need to find: **How many more candies does John have than James?**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ R $ = number of candies Robert has
- $ J $ = number of candies James has
- $ N $ = number of candies John has

From the problem:

- $ J = R + 6 $ (James has 6 more than Robert)
- $ N = 2R $ (John has twice as many as Robert)
- $ N = 54 $ (John has 54 candies)

---

### Step 2: Use the given value for John

Since $ N = 2R $ and $ N = 54 $, we can solve for $ R $:

$$
2R = 54 \Rightarrow R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
$$

So, **Robert has 27 candies**.

---

### Step 3: Find how many candies James has

From earlier:  
$$
J = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
$$

So, **James has 33 candies**.

---

### Step 4: Find how many more candies John has than James

$$
N - J = 54 - 33 = 21
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**John has 21 more candies than James.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the number of books each person has
- **Dolly** has **2 books**.
- **Pandora** has **1 book**.

So, **together**, they have:
$$
2 + 1 = 3 \text{ books}
$$

### Step 2: Understand how many books each reads
The problem says:
> "If both Dolly and Pandora read each others' books as well as their own..."

This means:
- **Dolly** reads:
  - Her **own 2 books**
  - **Pandora's 1 book**

So Dolly reads:
$$
2 + 1 = 3 \text{ books}
$$

- **Pandora** reads:
  - Her **own 1 book**
  - **Dolly's 2 books**

So Pandora reads:
$$
1 + 2 = 3 \text{ books}
$$

### Step 3: Add up the total number of books read by both
- Dolly reads 3 books
- Pandora reads 3 books

So together, they read:
$$
3 + 3 = 6 \text{ books}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**6 books** in total.
Let's break this down step by step to find out **how many hours Mike spends writing a week**.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many pen pals he still has**

- Initially, Mike had **5 pen pals**.
- He stopped being a penpal with **2 of them**.
- So, he now has **5 - 2 = 3 pen pals**.

---

### **Step 2: How many letters does each pen pal send per week?**

- Each pen pal sends **2 letters per week**.
- There are **3 pen pals** left.
- So, total letters sent per week = **3 × 2 = 6 letters**.

---

### **Step 3: How many pages per letter?**

- Each letter is **5 pages long**.
- So, for 6 letters: **6 × 5 = 30 pages**.

---

### **Step 4: How long does it take to write one page?**

- Mike can write **1 page every 6 minutes**.
- So, for 30 pages: **30 × 6 = 180 minutes**.

---

### **Step 5: Convert minutes to hours**

- There are **60 minutes in an hour**.
- So, **180 ÷ 60 = 3 hours**.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Mike spends 3 hours writing a week.**

15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Extra minutes used for other people**

He has used **300 extra minutes** for calls to other people.

So, the total minutes used are:

$$
450 \text{ (boss)} + 300 \text{ (others)} = 750 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Minutes left**

Total minutes in the plan:  
$$
1000 \text{ minutes}
$$

Minutes used:  
$$
750 \text{ minutes}
$$

Minutes left:

$$
1000 - 750 = \boxed{250} \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

We are given a problem involving the number of french fries Griffin has at different points in time. Let's go step by step and solve it carefully.

---

### Step 1: Start with Griffin’s initial amount

Griffin **had 24** french fries.

---

### Step 2: Kyle takes 5 fries

So, Griffin now has:

$$
24 - 5 = 19 \text{ fries}
$$

---

### Step 3: Billy takes twice as many as Kyle

Kyle took 5, so Billy took:

$$
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ fries}
$$

Now Griffin has:

$$
19 - 10 = 9 \text{ fries}
$$

---

### Step 4: Ginger gives Griffin some fries

Let’s call the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin **x**.

Now Griffin has:

$$
9 + x \text{ fries}
$$

---

### Step 5: Colby takes 3 less than the number of fries Kyle had taken

Kyle took 5, so Colby takes:

$$
5 - 3 = 2 \text{ fries}
$$

Now Griffin has:

$$
(9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x \text{ fries}
$$

---

### Step 6: In the end, Griffin has 27 fries

So we set up the equation:

$$
7 + x = 27
$$

Solving for **x**:

$$
x = 27 - 7 = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Ginger gave Griffin 20 french fries.**
We are given the following information:

- There are **4 snails** in one aquarium.
- There are **32 snails** in another aquarium.
- The **difference between the number of snails** in the two aquariums is **twice the amount of fish** in both aquariums.
- Both aquariums have the **same number of fish**.

We are to find: **How many fish are there in each aquarium?**

---

### Step 1: Find the difference in the number of snails

$$
\text{Difference in snails} = 32 - 4 = 28
$$

---

### Step 2: Let the number of fish in each aquarium be $ f $

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both is:

$$
2f
$$

---

### Step 3: Use the given condition

> The difference between the number of snails is **twice the amount of fish in both aquariums**.

So:

$$
28 = 2 \times (2f)
$$

Simplify:

$$
28 = 4f
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for $ f $

$$
f = \frac{28}{4} = 7
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

There are **7 fish in each aquarium**.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much Jean paid.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the total number of hours worked**

- Each day, the makeup artist works **6 hours**.
- She does this **4 times a week**.
- The movie takes **5 weeks** to finish.

So, total hours =  
$$
6 \text{ hours/day} \times 4 \text{ days/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the total cost before discount**

- The makeup artist charges **$250 per hour**.

Total cost before discount =  
$$
120 \text{ hours} \times 250 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Apply the 10% discount**

- The discount is **10%** of the total cost.

Discount amount =  
$$
30,000 \times 0.10 = 3,000 \text{ dollars}
$$

Final amount Jean pays =  
$$
30,000 - 3,000 = 27,000 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{27,000}
$$

Jean paid **$27,000** after the 10% discount.

### **Step 1: Understand the information given**

- **Monday:**
  - Sue ate **4 times as many cookies** as her sister.
  - Her sister ate **5 cookies** on Monday.
  
- **Tuesday:**
  - Sue ate **twice as many cookies** as her sister.
  - Her sister ate **13 cookies** on Tuesday.

- **Each cookie has 200 calories.**

We are asked to find:  
> How many **more calories** did Sue consume than her sister?

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how many cookies Sue ate each day**

#### **Monday:**
- Sister: 5 cookies
- Sue: 4 × 5 = **20 cookies**

#### **Tuesday:**
- Sister: 13 cookies
- Sue: 2 × 13 = **26 cookies**

---

### **Step 3: Total cookies eaten by each person**

- **Sue:**
  - Monday: 20 cookies
  - Tuesday: 26 cookies
  - Total: 20 + 26 = **46 cookies**

- **Sister:**
  - Monday: 5 cookies
  - Tuesday: 13 cookies
  - Total: 5 + 13 = **18 cookies**

---

### **Step 4: Calculate total calories**

- Each cookie = 200 calories

- **Sue’s total calories:**
  - 46 cookies × 200 = **9,200 calories**

- **Sister’s total calories:**
  - 18 cookies × 200 = **3,600 calories**

---

### **Step 5: Find the difference in calories**

Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- Each class has **20 students**.
- There are **3 classes** in total.
- The **school as a whole is 50% boys and 50% girls**.
- **First class**: 15 girls → So, boys = 20 - 15 = **5 boys**
- **Second class**: 12 girls → So, boys = 20 - 12 = **8 boys**

We need to find how many **boys are in the third class**.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of students in the school**

Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes:

$$
\text{Total students} = 3 \times 20 = 60
$$

Since the school is **50% boys and 50% girls**, that means:

$$
\text{Total boys} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
$$
$$
\text{Total girls} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find number of girls in the third class**

From the first two classes:

- First class: 15 girls  
- Second class: 12 girls  

So, total girls in the first two classes:

$$
15 + 12 = 27
$$

Therefore, the number of girls in the **third class** is:

$$
30 - 27 = 3
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find number of boys in the third class**

Each class has 20 students. So, the number of boys in the third class is:

$$
20 - 3 = 17
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{17}
$$

There are **17 boys** in the third class.
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Start with the original number of apps:**  
   Travis had **61** apps on his tablet.

2. **Subtract the number of apps he deleted:**  
   He deleted **9** apps.  
   So, after deleting:  
   $ 61 - 9 = 52 $ apps left.

3. **Add the number of apps he downloaded:**  
   He downloaded **18** more apps.  
   So, after downloading:  
   $ 52 + 18 = 70 $ apps.

### Final Answer: **70 apps** are on Travis's tablet now.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Last Night's Kill**

Rick killed:
- **10 wolves**
- **15 cougars**

So, last night he killed:

$$
10 + 15 = 25 \text{ animals}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Today's Kill**

We are told:

- **Today Rick killed three times as many wolves as cougars.**
- **He also killed three fewer cougars than the previous night (which was 15).**

Let’s define variables:

- Let $ c $ = number of **cougars** killed today  
- Then, number of **wolves** killed today = $ 3c $

Also, from the second statement:

$$
c = 15 - 3 = 12
$$

So, today he killed:

- **Cougars**: 12  
- **Wolves**: $ 3 \times 12 = 36 $

Total animals killed today:

$$
12 + 36 = 48
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total Animals Killed**

Last night: 25  
Today: 48

$$
25 + 48 = \boxed{73}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **73 animals**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

**Step 1: Identify Bill's starting floor.**

Bill starts on the **3rd floor**.

---

**Step 2: Understand the rule for the new floor.**

The problem says:

> He rides the elevator up to the floor that's equal to **4 times his starting floor plus 6**.

So, we need to compute:

$$
\text{New floor} = 4 \times (\text{Starting floor}) + 6
$$

Substitute the starting floor (3):

$$
\text{New floor} = 4 \times 3 + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18
$$

---

**Final Answer:**  
Bill is now on the **18th floor**. ✅
We are given the following information:

- **Mitchel** went down the water slide **30 times**.
- **Anne** went down the slide **30% less** than Mitchel.
- **Robert** went down the slide **4 times as much as Anne**.

We need to find out how many times **Robert** went down the slide.

---

### Step 1: Find how many times Anne went down the slide

Anne went down the slide **30% less** than Mitchel.

Mitchel went down the slide **30 times**.

So, 30% of 30 is:

$$
0.30 \times 30 = 9
$$

So, Anne went down the slide:

$$
30 - 9 = 21 \text{ times}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many times Robert went down the slide

Robert went down the slide **4 times as much as Anne**.

Anne went down the slide **21 times**, so:

$$
4 \times 21 = 84
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{84}
$$

Robert went down the water slide **84 times**.
We are given the following:

- There are **10 stalls**, each with **20 cows**.
- Mr. Sylas **buys 40 cows** and **divides them equally** among the **20 stalls**.

Let’s break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Total number of cows initially

Each of the 10 stalls has 20 cows:

$$
10 \text{ stalls} \times 20 \text{ cows per stall} = 200 \text{ cows}
$$

---

### Step 2: Mr. Sylas buys 40 more cows

So now the total number of cows is:

$$
200 + 40 = 240 \text{ cows}
$$

---

### Step 3: He divides the 40 new cows equally into the 20 stalls

He puts an equal number of the **new cows** into each of the **20 stalls**:

$$
\frac{40}{20} = 2 \text{ new cows per stall}
$$

---

### Step 4: How many cows are in each stall now?

Each stall originally had 20 cows, and now gets 2 more from the new purchase:

$$
20 + 2 = 22 \text{ cows per stall}
$$

---

### Step 5: How many cows are in 8 stalls?

$$
8 \text{ stalls} \times 22 \text{ cows per stall} = 176 \text{ cows}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{176}
$$
Let's calculate the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank step by step.

---

### Step 1: Pennies  
- **100 pennies**  
- Each penny is worth **$0.01**  
- Total value = $ 100 \times 0.01 = \$1.00 $

---

### Step 2: Nickels  
- **40 nickels**  
- Each nickel is worth **$0.05**  
- Total value = $ 40 \times 0.05 = \$2.00 $

---

### Step 3: Dimes  
- **20 dimes**  
- Each dime is worth **$0.10**  
- Total value = $ 20 \times 0.10 = \$2.00 $

---

### Step 4: Dollar bills  
- **40 dollar bills**  
- Each bill is worth **$1.00**  
- Total value = $ 40 \times 1.00 = \$40.00 $

---

### Step 5: Add them all together  
- Pennies: \$1.00  
- Nickels: \$2.00  
- Dimes: \$2.00  
- Dollar bills: \$40.00  

**Total = $1.00 + $2.00 + $2.00 + $40.00 = \$45.00**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **\$45.00**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many 10-foot sections are in a 200-foot redwood**

$$
\frac{200 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet per section}} = 20 \text{ sections}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the weight of one 10-foot section**

Each 10-foot section weighs **400 pounds**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the entire tree (before termites)**

$$
20 \text{ sections} \times 400 \text{ pounds per section} = 8000 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate how much the termites ate (30% of the total weight)**

$$
30\% \text{ of } 8000 = 0.30 \times 8000 = 2400 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Subtract the weight eaten by termites from the original weight**

$$
8000 - 2400 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{5600} \text{ pounds}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for the overdue books

Nancy owes **$0.50** per book for **8 books**.

$$
\text{Cost per book} = \$0.50 \\
\text{Number of books} = 8 \\
\text{Total cost for books} = 0.50 \times 8 = \$4.00
$$

---

### Step 2: Add the flat fee

She also has to pay a **flat $2.00 fee** for having at least one book that's over a week overdue.

$$
\text{Flat fee} = \$2.00
$$

---

### Step 3: Add both amounts together

$$
\text{Total amount to pay} = \$4.00 + \$2.00 = \$6.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Nancy has to pay a total of \$6.00.**
We are given the following information:

- **Andrea has 52 apples.**
- **Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.**
- **Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.**
- **Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.**

We need to find the **total number of fruits** (apples and bananas) that Andrea and Jamal have together.

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ A_a $ = number of apples Andrea has = **52**
- $ J_a $ = number of apples Jamal has
- $ J_b $ = number of bananas Jamal has
- $ A_b $ = number of bananas Andrea has

---

### Step 2: Use the given relationships

From the problem:

1. **Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal:**

$$
A_a = J_a + 8
$$

Since $ A_a = 52 $, we can solve for $ J_a $:

$$
52 = J_a + 8 \Rightarrow J_a = 52 - 8 = 44
$$

So, **Jamal has 44 apples**.

2. **Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:**

$$
A_b = \frac{1}{2} J_b
$$

3. **Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:**

$$
J_b = J_a + 4
$$

We already found $ J_a = 44 $, so:

$$
J_b = 44 + 4 = 48
$$

Now plug into the equation for Andrea's bananas:

$$
A_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
$$

So, **Andrea has 24 bananas**.

---

### Step 3: Total number of fruits

- Andrea: 52 apples + 24 bananas = **76 fruits**
- Jamal: 44 apples + 48 bananas = **92 fruits**

Total fruits = 76 + 92 = **168**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{168}
$$
We are given:

- **2 cups of flour** are needed to make **12 cookies** (a dozen).
- Carla is making **36 cookies today** and **30 cookies tomorrow**.

---

### Step 1: Find how much flour is needed per cookie

$$
\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ cup per cookie}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the flour needed for 36 cookies today

$$
36 \times \frac{1}{6} = 6 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the flour needed for 30 cookies tomorrow

$$
30 \times \frac{1}{6} = 5 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add both amounts together

$$
6 + 5 = 11 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Carla will need 11 cups of flour** to bake 36 cookies today and 30 cookies tomorrow.
We are given:

- There are **9,300 pennies** in a cup.
- We need to find the **total dollar amount** in a stack that contains **two-thirds of the pennies**.

---

### Step 1: Find two-thirds of 9,300 pennies

$$
\frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = ?
$$

First, divide 9,300 by 3:

$$
9,300 \div 3 = 3,100
$$

Now multiply by 2:

$$
3,100 \times 2 = 6,200
$$

So, there are **6,200 pennies** in the stack.

---

### Step 2: Convert pennies to dollars

Since **1 dollar = 100 pennies**, we divide the number of pennies by 100 to get the dollar amount:

$$
6,200 \div 100 = 62
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{62}
$$

The total dollar amount in the stack is **$62**.

### Step 3: Find how many trees Harry has.

Harry has **5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has**.

First, find twice the number of trees Ferdinand has:

$$
2 \times 3 = 6
$$

Then add 5:

$$
6 + 5 = 11
$$

So, **Harry has 11 trees**.

---

### Step 4: Find how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand.

$$
11 - 3 = 8
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Harry has 8 more trees than Ferdinand.**

Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Selling Price of the House**
The selling price of the house is:

$$
\$350{,}000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Brokerage Fee (5% of selling price)**
Brokerage fee:

$$
5\% \times 350{,}000 = 0.05 \times 350{,}000 = \$17{,}500
$$

---

### **Step 3: Transfer Fee (12% of selling price)**
Transfer fee:

$$
12\% \times 350{,}000 = 0.12 \times 350{,}000 = \$42{,}000
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total Cost of the House**
Total cost = Selling price + Brokerage + Transfer fee

$$
350{,}000 + 17{,}500 + 42{,}000 = 350{,}000 + 59{,}500 = \$409{,}500
$$

---

### **Step 5: Compare with Mrs. Cruz’s Budget**
Mrs. Cruz’s budget is:

$$
\$400{,}000
$$

So, how much more is the total price than her budget?

$$
409{,}500 - 400{,}000 = \$9{,}500
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$9{,}500}
$$

The total price of the house is **\$9,500 more** than Mrs. Cruz's budget.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find **Mr. Tan's net proceeds** from selling the house.

---

### **Step 1: Selling Price of the House**
The selling price is:

$$
\$400{,}000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Transfer Fees (3% of selling price)**

$$
\text{Transfer fees} = 3\% \times 400{,}000 = 0.03 \times 400{,}000 = \$12{,}000
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate Brokerage Fee (5% of selling price)**

$$
\text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times 400{,}000 = 0.05 \times 400{,}000 = \$20{,}000
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total Expenses**

$$
\text{Total expenses} = \text{Transfer fees} + \text{Brokerage fee} = 12{,}000 + 20{,}000 = \$32{,}000
$$

---

### **Step 5: Loan Amount Paid by Mr. Tan**

He paid:

$$
\$250{,}000
$$

This is the amount he used to pay off the loan on the house.

---

### **Step 6: Net Proceeds Calculation**

Net proceeds = Selling price - Total expenses - Loan amount paid

$$
\text{Net proceeds} = 400{,}000 - 32{,}000 - 250{,}000 = \$118{,}000
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$118{,}000}
$$

This is how much Mr. Tan's **net proceeds** were from selling the house.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Time to heat oil to 300°F**
It takes **20 minutes** for the oil to heat up to **300°F**.

---

### **Step 2: Time to heat oil from 300°F to 400°F**

This part takes **40% longer** than the time it took to heat to 300°F.

- Time to heat to 300°F = 20 minutes  
- 40% of 20 minutes = $ 0.4 \times 20 = 8 $ minutes  
- So, time to heat from 300°F to 400°F = $ 20 + 8 = 28 $ minutes

---

### Step 1: Determine the number of bedrooms and windows in each house

- **Each house has 3 bedrooms.**
- **Each bedroom has 2 windows.**

So, the number of **bedroom-related windows** per house is:

$$
3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}
$$

---

### Step 2: Add the additional windows in each house

- **Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms.**

So, total windows per house:

$$
6 \text{ (bedroom windows)} + 4 \text{ (additional windows)} = 10 \text{ windows/house}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total windows in both houses

- There are **2 houses**, so:

$$
2 \text{ houses} \times 10 \text{ windows/house} = 20 \text{ total windows}

$$
\boxed{20}
$$

There are **20 total windows** between the houses.
Let's calculate the total cost of the items first:

- Cocoa: $4.20  
- Laundry: $9.45  
- Pasta: $1.35  

### Step 1: Add the costs together  
$$
4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65  
$$  
$$
13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00  
$$

So, the total cost is **$15.00**.

### Step 2: Subtract the total cost from the amount paid  
She paid **$20.00**, so:  
$$
20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00  
$$

We are given the total number of stitches in the sweater and the number of stitches used for different parts of the sweater. We need to find how many stitches each **sleeve** takes.

---

### Step 1: Total Stitches in the Sweater
> The whole sweater is an **1800-stitch project**.

So:

$$
\text{Total Stitches} = 1800
$$

---

### Step 2: Stitches Used for Other Parts

- **Body**: 900 stitches  
- **Collar**: A tenth of the body →  
  $$
  \frac{1}{10} \times 900 = 90 \text{ stitches}
  $$

- **Rosette**: Twice as many as the collar →  
  $$
  2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Add Up the Known Parts

$$
\text{Body} + \text{Collar} + \text{Rosette} = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \text{ stitches}
$$

---

### Step 4: Subtract from Total to Find Stitches for Sleeves

There are **two sleeves**, so let’s call the number of stitches per sleeve $ x $. Then:

$$
2x = 1800 - 1170 = 630
$$

$$
x = \frac{630}{2} = 315
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Each **sleeve** takes **315 stitches**.

Let's break down the problem step by step and calculate how many lines Sean has to memorize.

---

### **Given:**

1. **Solo song:**  
   - Has **54 lines** in total.

2. **First scene:**  
   - Has **twice the number of lines** as the solo song.  
     So, lines in first scene = $ 2 \times 54 = 108 $ lines.  
   - Only **a third of them are his lines**.  
     So, Sean's lines in first scene = $ \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 $ lines.

3. **Second scene:**  
   - Has **six more lines than the song**.  
     So, lines in second scene = $ 54 + 6 = 60 $ lines.  
   - **Four-fifths of them are his lines**.  
     So, Sean's lines in second scene = $ \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 $ lines.

---

### **Total lines Sean has to memorize:**

- Solo song: 54 lines  
- First scene: 36 lines  
- Second scene: 48 lines  

$$
\text{Total} = 54 + 36 + 48 = 138
$$

---

### ✅ **Answer:**
Sean has to memorize **138 lines**.
We are given that **Carly had 80 cards**, and we need to determine how many of them had the letter **D** on them.

Let’s go step by step:

---

### Step 1: Total number of cards = 80

---

### Step 2: Cards with the letter **A**

- $ \frac{2}{5} $ of the cards have the letter A:
  
$$
\frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \text{ cards}
$$

So, **32 cards** have A.

Remaining cards (not A):  
$$
80 - 32 = 48 \text{ cards}
$$

---

### Step 3: Cards with the letter **B**

- $ \frac{1}{2} $ of the remaining 48 cards have the letter B:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \text{ cards}
$$

So, **24 cards** have B.

Remaining cards (not B):  
$$
48 - 24 = 24 \text{ cards}
$$

---

### Step 4: Cards with the letter **C**

- $ \frac{5}{8} $ of the remaining 24 cards have the letter C:

$$
\frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \text{ cards}
$$

So, **15 cards** have C.

Remaining cards (not C):  
$$
24 - 15 = 9 \text{ cards}
$$

---

### Step 5: Cards with the letter **D**

These are the remaining cards that do **not** have A, B, or C.

$$
\boxed{9} \text{ cards}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{9}
$$

**9 cards had the letter D on them.**

$$
90 \text{ minutes} + 150 \text{ minutes} = 240 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 4: Convert minutes to hours  
$$
240 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 4 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **4 hours**
We are given that the **sum of Mico and Marco's current ages is 20**.

We are given the following information:

- **Ruby is 6 times older than Sam.**
- **In 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam.**

Let’s define the variables:

- Let $ S $ be Sam's current age.
- Then Ruby's current age is $ 6S $ (since she is 6 times older than Sam).

---

### Step 1: Express future ages

In 9 years:

- Sam will be $ S + 9 $ years old.
- Ruby will be $ 6S + 9 $ years old.

According to the problem:

$$
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve the equation

Start by expanding the right-hand side:

$$
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
$$

Now subtract $ 3S $ from both sides:

$$
3S + 9 = 27
$$

Subtract 9 from both sides:

$$
3S = 18
$$

Divide both sides by 3:

$$
S = 6
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Sam is currently 6 years old.**

We are given that a 76-star flag has:

- **3 rows of 8 stars**
- **2 rows of 6 stars**
- The **rest** are **rows of 5 stars**

We are to find: **How many rows of 5 stars are there?**

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of stars in the rows with known numbers

- 3 rows of 8 stars:  
  $ 3 \times 8 = 24 $ stars

- 2 rows of 6 stars:  
  $ 2 \times 6 = 12 $ stars

Total so far:  
$ 24 + 12 = 36 $ stars

---

### Step 2: Subtract from total to find how many stars are left for 5-star rows

Total stars on the flag = 76  
Stars used in known rows = 36  
So, remaining stars =  
$ 76 - 36 = 40 $ stars

---

### Step 3: Find how many rows of 5 stars can be made from the remaining 40 stars

Each row of 5 stars uses 5 stars.  
Number of such rows =  
$ \frac{40}{5} = 8 $

---

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 3 trucks** are needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.
We are given the following information:

- **Fast lane car speed**: 60 miles per hour  
- **Slow lane car speed**: Half of that = $ \frac{60}{2} = 30 $ miles per hour  
- **Distance traveled by fast lane car**: 480 miles  

We are asked to find **how long it took the slow lane car to travel the same distance (480 miles)**.

---

### Step 1: Find the time taken by the **fast lane car** (for reference)

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} = 8 \text{ hours}
$$

So, the fast lane car took **8 hours** to travel 480 miles.

---

### Step 2: Use the same distance (480 miles) for the **slow lane car**

Now, we calculate how long it takes the slow lane car to travel **the same distance**, at a speed of **30 mph**.

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ mph}} = 16 \text{ hours}

### Step 1: Determine how many medals Izzy has.

Ali has **22** medals.

Izzy has **5 less** than Ali:

$$
\text{Izzy's medals} = 22 - 5 = 17
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together.

$$
\text{Total medals (Ali + Izzy)} = 22 + 17 = 39
$$

---

### Step 3: Understand the phrase "together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting."

This means:

$$
\text{Total medals (Ali + Izzy)} = \frac{\text{Total medals given out}}{10}
$$

So:

$$
39 = \frac{\text{Total medals given out}}{10}
$$

To find the total medals given out, multiply both sides by 10:

$$
\text{Total medals given out} = 39 \times 10 = 390
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{390}
$$

So, **390 medals** have been given out for counting.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the time frame**
Susan works **between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.**, which is a total of:

$$
11 - 8 = 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ minutes}
$$

But she **pauses for half an hour (30 minutes)** in between. So, the actual time she works is:

$$
180 - 30 = 150 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate her earnings per minute**
She earns **$5 every 10 minutes**.

So, her earnings per minute are:

$$
\frac{5}{10} = 0.5 \text{ dollars per minute}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total earnings**
She works for **150 minutes**, so her total earnings are:

- **Jim** has **3 points less than Mike**, so:
  $$
  \text{Jim} = 21 - 3 = 18
  $$
- **Tony** has **2 times more than Mike**, so:
  $$
  \text{Tony} = 2 \times 21 = 42
  $$

So, after 3 rounds:
- Mike: 21
- Jim: 18
- Tony: 42

---

### **Step 2: Apply the fourth round rule**

In the **fourth round**, **every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points**.

Let’s check who qualifies:

- **Mike**: 21 → **over 20** → gets +1 → **22**
- **Jim**: 18 → **not over 20** → no extra point → **18**
- **Tony**: 42 → **over 20** → gets +1 → **43**

---

### **Step 3: Total points after the fourth round**

Now add up all the final points:

- Mike: 22
- Jim: 18
- Tony: 43

$$
\text{Total} = 22 + 18 + 43 = \boxed{83}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **83 points in total**.

We are told that there are **2 sons**, and their ages are **8** and **4**.

---

### Step 3: How many oranges each son washes

The problem says:

> "He asks his 2 sons to wash as many oranges as they are years old."

So:

- The **oldest son (8 years old)** washes **8 oranges**.
- The **youngest son (4 years old)** washes **4 oranges**.

Total number of oranges washed:

$$
8 + 4 = 12 \text{ oranges}
$$

---

### Step 4: Oranges left unwashed

Total oranges = 15  
Oranges washed = 12  

$$
15 - 12 = 3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**3 oranges are left unwashed.**
Let's break this down step by step to find the **total number of activities** Darren does over **two days**.

---

### **Day 1:**
- Pushups: **100**
- Squats: **50**
- Dumbbell presses: **20**

**Total for Day 1:**
$$
100 + 50 + 20 = 170 \text{ activities}
$$

---

### **Day 2:**
- Pushups: **20 more than Day 1** → $100 + 20 = 120$
- Squats: **10 fewer than Day 1** → $50 - 10 = 40$
- Dumbbell presses: **doubled** → $20 \times 2 = 40$

**Total for Day 2:**
$$
120 + 40 + 40 = 200 \text{ activities}
$$

---

### **Total over 2 days:**
$$
170 + 200 = \boxed{370} \text{ activities}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{370}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last.

---

### **Step 1: Determine daily rice consumption per person**

Each person consumes **0.2 kg of rice per meal**.

They eat **lunch and dinner**, so that’s **2 meals per day**.

So, per person per day:

$$
0.2 \, \text{kg/meal} \times 2 \, \text{meals/day} = 0.4 \, \text{kg/day}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Total daily consumption for the household**

There are **5 people** in the household.

$$
0.4 \, \text{kg/person/day} \times 5 \, \text{people} = 2.0 \, \text{kg/day}
$$

---

### **Step 3: How many days will 42 kg last?**

$$
\frac{42 \, \text{kg}}{2.0 \, \text{kg/day}} = 21 \, \text{days}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Convert days to weeks**

$$
\frac{21 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 3 \, \text{weeks}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{3} \text{ weeks}
$$

The 42 kg bag of rice will last **3 weeks**.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many crates Sam was **off** from his target for the week.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the target**
Sam’s **target** is to sell **120 crates of bread in a week**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many days he actually sold bread**
- He was **closed on Monday and Friday** → so he only sold on **Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday**.
- That’s **4 days** of sales.

---

### **Step 3: Add up the number of crates sold each day**

- **Saturday**: 20 crates  
- **Tuesday**: 15 crates  
- **Wednesday**: 12 crates  
- **Thursday**: 18 crates  

Now add those:

$$
20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 \text{ crates}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Compare to the target**

Sam’s **target** was 120 crates, but he only sold **65 crates**.

So, he was **off by**:

$$
120 - 65 = \boxed{55} \text{ crates}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Sam was off from his target by 55 crates.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- **Opening bid:** $200
- **Bids increase by $50 each time**
- **3 other people each bid once**
- **Carmen bids after each of the 3 people**
- **Carmen eventually wins**

We need to find out **how much Carmen paid for the desk**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the bidding sequence**

The auction starts with an opening bid of **$200**.

Then, **3 other people each bid once**, and **Carmen bids after each of them**. So the order of bids is:

1. Opening bid: **$200**
2. First person bids: **$200 + $50 = $250**
3. Carmen bids: **$250 + $50 = $300**
4. Second person bids: **$300 + $50 = $350**
5. Carmen bids: **$350 + $50 = $400**
6. Third person bids: **$400 + $50 = $450**
7. Carmen bids: **$450 + $50 = $500**

At this point, Carmen has made three bids after the three other people, and she **wins** the desk on her third bid of **$500**.

---

### **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{500}
$$

So, **Carmen pays $500** for the desk.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much John pays a year for the driving service.

---

### **1. Distance per day**
- One-way distance: 30 miles
- Round trip (to work and back):  
  $ 30 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 60 \text{ miles/day} $

---

### **2. Distance per year**
- Days per week: 5
- Weeks per year: 50  
  So, total days per year:  
  $ 5 \text{ days/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 250 \text{ days/year} $

- Total miles per year:  
  $ 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 250 \text{ days/year} = 15,000 \text{ miles/year} $

---

### **3. Cost per mile**
- Charge per mile: $2  
  So, cost for miles per year:  
  $ 15,000 \text{ miles} \times 2 = \$30,000 $

---

### **4. Bonus per month**
- Bonus: $150 per month  
- Months per year: 12  
  So, total bonus per year:  
  $ 150 \times 12 = \$1,800 $

---

### **5. Total annual cost**
- Cost for miles: $30,000  
- Bonus: $1,800  
- **Total**:  
  $ 30,000 + 1,800 = \$31,800 $

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**John pays $31,800 a year for the driving service.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the goal

Peter wants to **exercise for twice the amount of time** he did on **Monday and Sunday combined** on **Tuesday**.

So, we need to:

- Find how much time Peter exercised on **Monday and Sunday**.
- Then double that total to find out how much he needs to exercise on **Tuesday**.

---

### Step 2: Given information

- Time on **Sunday**: 23 minutes  
- Time on **Monday**: 16 minutes  

---

### Step 3: Add Monday and Sunday times

$$
23 + 16 = 39 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 4: Double that amount for Tuesday's goal

$$
2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Peter has to exercise for **78 minutes** on Tuesday to reach his goal.
We are asked to determine **how many pieces of paper** are used in a **32-page tabloid**, assuming it's made by folding a single sheet of paper **vertically** and then unfolding it, and printing pages in a specific way.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Folding Process

A **tabloid** is a type of newspaper with **32 pages**. When you fold a single sheet of paper **vertically** (i.e., along the vertical axis), you can create **two leaves** (i.e., two pages on each side of the folded sheet). Each leaf has **two pages**: one on the front and one on the back.

So:

- One folded sheet → 4 pages
- Therefore, to get 32 pages, we need:
  
  $$
  \frac{32}{4} = 8 \text{ sheets of paper}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Confirm the Page Layout

Let’s confirm this by thinking about how the pages are arranged when you fold a sheet of paper vertically:

- Folded sheet → 4 pages total
- The pages are printed in the following order (assuming left-to-right, front-to-back):

  - Left back → Page 1
  - Left front → Page 2
  - Right front → Page 32
  - Right back → Page 31

This is a common way to print a tabloid, where the pages are printed in reverse order on the folded sheet.

So for each folded sheet (which becomes 4 pages), the pages are:

- 1, 2, 32, 31

Then, the next sheet would be:

- 3, 4, 29, 28

And so on...

Each sheet contributes **4 pages**, so to get 32 pages:

$$
\frac{32}{4} = 8 \text{ sheets}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{8}
$$

So, **8 pieces of paper** are used to make a 32-page tabloid.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial amount**: Annika starts with **$50**.

2. **Spent on food and snacks**: She spends **half of $50** on food and snacks.  
   $$
   \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   $$

3. **Spent on rides**: She spends an additional **$10** on rides.

4. **Total spent**:  
   $$
   25 + 10 = 35
   $$

5. **Amount left**:  
   $$
   50 - 35 = 15
   $$

### Final Answer: **$15** is left.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much **Elise earned in the second year**.

---

### **Given:**

- Total number of books: **250**
- Price per book: **$20**
- She has been selling for **3 years**
- She sold **twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year**
- There are **currently 50 unsold books**
- Her sales this year (current year) is **45 books**

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many books were sold in the current year**

She sold **45 books this year**.

---

### **Step 2: Use the information about the first year**

> "She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year."

So, books sold in the **first year** = 2 × books sold in the **current year**  
= 2 × 45 = **90 books**

---

### **Step 3: Find out how many books were sold in the second year**

We know:

- Total books = 250
- Books currently unsold = 50
- Books sold in first year = 90
- Books sold in current year = 45

So, books sold in the **second year** = Total books - (books sold in first year + books sold in current year + books unsold)

= 250 - (90 + 45 + 50)  
= 250 - 185 = **65 books**

---

### **Step 4: Calculate total earnings in the second year**

Each book sells for **$20**, and she sold **65 books** in the second year.

Total earnings in the second year = 65 × 20 = **$1,300**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $1,300**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### 1. **Determine how many hours Watson works in a week:**
- Watson works **10 hours per day**.
- He works **5 days a week**.
  
$$
\text{Hours per week} = 10 \, \text{hours/day} \times 5 \, \text{days/week} = 50 \, \text{hours/week}
$$

### 2. **Calculate his weekly earnings from hourly wage:**
- He earns **$10 per hour**.

$$
\text{Weekly wage} = 50 \, \text{hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$500
$$

### 3. **Add the weekly bonus:**
- He gets a **$300 bonus** each week if the company performs well.

$$
\text{Total weekly earnings} = \$500 + \$300 = \$800
$$

### 4. **Find out how many weeks are in April:**
- April has **30 days**.
- Since he works **5 days a week**, the number of weeks is:

$$
\text{Number of weeks} = \frac{30}{5} = 6 \, \text{weeks}
$$

### 5. **Calculate total earnings for April:**
- He earns **$800 per week**.
- For 6 weeks:

$$
\text{Total earnings} = 6 \times \$800 = \$4800
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Watson made $4800 in April.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem

- John **arm-wrestles 20 people**.
- He **beats 80%** of them.
- We are asked: **How many people did he lose to?**

---

### Step 2: Calculate how many people John beats

He beats 80% of the 20 people:

$$
0.80 \times 20 = 16
$$

So, John **beats 16 people**.

---

### Step 3: Find out how many people he loses to

Since he wrestled **20 people** in total, and he beat **16**, the number of people he lost to is:

$$
20 - 16 = 4
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**John lost to 4 people.**
We are given:

- The bakery produces **60 loaves of bread each day**.
- **Two-thirds** of the loaves are sold in the **morning**.
- After the morning sales, **half of what is left** is sold **equally in the afternoon and evening**.

We need to find how many loaves are sold in the **afternoon**.

---

### Step 1: Find how many loaves are sold in the morning

Two-thirds of 60 loaves are sold in the morning:

$$
\frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
$$

So, **40 loaves are sold in the morning**.

---

### Step 2: Find how many loaves are left after the morning

$$
60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves left}
$$

---

### Step 3: Half of the remaining loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening

Half of 20 is:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
$$

These 10 loaves are **equally sold in the afternoon and evening**, so:

$$
\frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves sold in the afternoon}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{5}
$$

**5 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how much weight Joey loses in one week.**

Joey loses **8 pounds in 4 weeks**.

So, the amount of weight Joey loses per week is:

$$
\frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how much weight Sandy loses per week.**

We are told that **Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week**.

Joey loses **2 pounds per week**, so in **one week**, Joey loses **2 pounds**.

That means Sandy needs **4 weeks** to lose **2 pounds**.

So, how much does Sandy lose per week?

$$
\frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
$$

---

### **Step 3: How many weeks will it take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey?**

We want to find out how many weeks it takes Sandy to lose **8 pounds** (the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks).

Since Sandy loses **0.5 pounds per week**, we divide:

$$
\frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
It will take **16 weeks** for Sandy to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much you will save if you buy **2 tubs of ice cream** and **4 packets of milk**.

---

### Step 1: Ice Cream Discount

- Original price of one tub of ice cream = **$13**
- Discounted price = **$11**
- So, the **discount per tub** =  
  $$
  13 - 11 = 2 \text{ dollars}
  $$

- For **2 tubs**, the total discount is:  
  $$
  2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Milk Discount

- The **discount per packet of milk** = **$0.5**

- For **4 packets**, the total discount is:  
  $$
  4 \times 0.5 = 2 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Total Savings

Now, add up the savings from both ice cream and milk:

$$
4 \text{ (from ice cream)} + 2 \text{ (from milk)} = 6 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
You will save **$6** if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Problem Summary:**

- **Helena** gives someone a serum.
- The serum causes **extra arms** every **3 days**.
- It causes **extra legs** every **5 days**.
- We are to find out how many **new limbs** (arms + legs) the person will have grown after **15 days**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the pattern of limb growth**

- Every **3 days**, the person gets **1 extra arm**.
- Every **5 days**, the person gets **1 extra leg**.

So, we need to count how many times each of these events happens in **15 days**.

---

### **Step 2: Count the number of arms added in 15 days**

We want to know how many times 3 divides into 15.

$$
\frac{15}{3} = 5
$$

So, the person gets **5 extra arms**.

---

### **Step 3: Count the number of legs added in 15 days**

We want to know how many times 5 divides into 15.

$$
\frac{15}{5} = 3
$$

So, the person gets **3 extra legs**.

---

### **Step 4: Add the number of arms and legs**

$$
5 \text{ arms} + 3 \text{ legs} = 8 \text{ new limbs}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

**8 new limbs** will be grown after 15 days.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total money Theo has**
Theo has:

$$
\$6000
$$

He wants to **save $2000** for the trip, so he can spend the remaining amount on other things, including **gifts for his business partners**.

So, the amount he is allowed to **spend** is:

$$
\$6000 - \$2000 = \$4000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the cost of the business suits**

He buys **6 business suits** at **$100 each**:

$$
6 \times 100 = \$600
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the cost of the suitcases**

He buys **3 suitcases** at **$50 each**:

$$
3 \times 50 = \$150
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the cost of the flight ticket**

The flight ticket costs **$700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit**.

- Cost of one business suit = \$100  
- 5 times that = $5 \times 100 = \$500$  
- Add \$700:  
$$
500 + 700 = \$1200
$$

So, the **flight ticket costs \$1200**.

---

### **Step 5: Total amount spent so far**

Now add up all the expenses:

- Business suits: \$600  
- Suitcases: \$150  
- Flight ticket: \$1200  

$$
600 + 150 + 1200 = \$1950
$$

---

### **Step 6: Amount left to spend on gifts**

Theo can spend up to **\$4000** (since he wants to save \$2000). He has already spent **\$1950**, so the amount left for **gifts** is:

$$
4000 - 1950 = \$2050
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{2050}
$$

Theo has to spend **\$2050** on buying gifts for his business partners.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the family structure
- The family has **5 people**.
- **3 people** eat **3 eggs each day**.
- The remaining **2 people** eat **2 eggs each day**.

### Step 2: Calculate daily egg consumption
- For the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each:
  $$
  3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}
  $$
- For the 2 people who eat 2 eggs each:
  $$
  2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}
  $$

### Step 3: Total daily egg consumption
$$
9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs/day}
$$

### Step 4: Weekly egg consumption (7 days)
$$
13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The family consumes 91 eggs in a week.**
We are given the following information:

- **Quinn is 30 years old.**
- **Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.**
- **Trent is 5 years older than Jane.**

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find Jane's age

Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.

$$
\text{Jane's age} = \text{Quinn's age} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
$$

So, **Jane is 27 years old**.

---

### Step 2: Find Trent's age

Trent is 5 years older than Jane.

$$
\text{Trent's age} = \text{Jane's age} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Trent is 32 years old.**
We are given the following information:

1. **Currently**, Cera is **46 years old**.
2. **Six years ago**, Noah was **half as old as Cera**.
3. **Six years ago**, the population of Chile was **half what it is now**.
4. **Six years ago**, the population of Chile was **3000 times Noah's age** at that time.

We are to find: **What is the current population of Chile?**

---

### Step 1: Determine Noah's current age

Let’s denote:
- $ N $ = Noah's current age
- Cera's current age = 46 (given)

Six years ago:
- Cera was $ 46 - 6 = 40 $ years old
- Noah was half as old as Cera then, so Noah was $ \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 $ years old six years ago

So, Noah's **current age** is:
$$
N = 20 + 6 = 26
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the population information

Let’s denote:
- $ P $ = current population of Chile
- Then, six years ago, the population was $ \frac{P}{2} $

Also, six years ago, the population was **3000 times Noah's age at that time**.

Noah was 20 years old six years ago, so:
$$
\text{Population six years ago} = 3000 \times 20 = 60,000
$$

But we also said the population six years ago was $ \frac{P}{2} $, so:
$$
\frac{P}{2} = 60,000
$$

Solve for $ P $:
$$
P = 2 \times 60,000 = 120,000
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{120,000}
$$

So, the **current population of Chile is 120,000**.
We are given the following information:

- The **total number of players** on the football team is **105**.
- There are **twice as many players on the offense** as there are on the **defense**.
- There are **half as many players on the special teams** as there are on the **defense**.

Let’s define:

- Let $ D $ = number of players on **defense**.
- Then, number of players on **offense** = $ 2D $ (since it's twice the defense).
- Number of players on **special teams** = $ \frac{D}{2} $ (since it's half the defense).

Now, the total number of players is the sum of players on offense, defense, and special teams:

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Offense} + \text{Defense} + \text{Special Teams}
$$

$$
105 = 2D + D + \frac{D}{2}
$$

Now solve this equation step by step.

---

### Step 1: Combine like terms

$$
105 = 2D + D + \frac{D}{2}
$$

$$
105 = 3D + \frac{D}{2}
$$

To combine these, convert to a common denominator:

$$
3D = \frac{6D}{2}
$$

So:

$$
105 = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2}
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ D $

$$
\frac{7D}{2} = 105
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
7D = 210
$$

Divide both sides by 7:

$$
D = \frac{210}{7} = 30
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{30}
$$

There are **30 players on the defense**.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many people show up for Martha's Christmas party.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of invited people**

Martha invited:

- 2 families with 6 people each → $ 2 \times 6 = 12 $ people  
- 3 families with 4 people each → $ 3 \times 4 = 12 $ people  

So the **total number of people invited** is:

$$
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ people}
$$

---

### **Step 2: People who couldn't come due to illness**

We're told:

- **8 people** couldn't come due to illness.

---

### **Step 3: People who had previous commitments**

We're also told:

- **1/4 that number** (of the 8 who were ill) had previous commitments.

So:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ people}
$$

These 2 people also didn't come to the party.

---

### **Step 4: Total number of people who didn't come**

Add the two groups:

$$
8 \text{ (ill)} + 2 \text{ (previous commitments)} = 10 \text{ people didn't come}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Number of people who showed up**

Subtract those who didn’t come from the total number of people invited:

$$
24 - 10 = 14
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 14 people show up for Martha's party.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 2: Marbles already in the store**
The store originally had **50 marbles**.

So, after adding the 20 marbles from Johanna, the total number of marbles is:

$$
50 + 20 = 70 \text{ marbles}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Marbles given by Solomon's father**
His father gave him **2/5 times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna**.

He bought 20 marbles from Johanna, so:

$$
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = 8 \text{ marbles}
$$

Add these to the total:

$$
70 + 8 = 78 \text{ marbles}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Weight of each marble**
Each marble weighs **2 kg**.

So, the total weight of all marbles is:

$$
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{156 \text{ kg}}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find the volume of the pool**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so its volume is calculated as:

$$
\text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
$$

Given:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 5 feet

$$
\text{Volume} = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the cost**

The cost to fill is $0.10 per cubic foot.

$$
\text{Cost} = 120 \times 0.10 = 12 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $12**
We are given the following information:

- The classroom has **30 boys**.
- There are **3 times as many girls as boys**.
- There are **1/10 as many nongendered children as boys**.

We are to find the **total number of children** in the classroom.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of girls

It says there are **3 times as many girls as boys**.

$$
\text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the number of nongendered children

It says there are **1/10 as many nongendered children as boys**.

$$
\text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
$$

---

### Step 3: Add up all the children

$$
\text{Total children} = \text{boys} + \text{girls} + \text{nongendered children}
$$
$$
= 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{123}
$$
We are given:

- The **ratio of electric poles to electric wires** is **1:3**.
- The **total number of electric wires** is **45**.

We are asked to find the **total number of electric poles** needed.

---

### Step 1: Understand the ratio

The ratio **1:3** means that for every **1 electric pole**, there are **3 electric wires**.

So, if we let the number of poles be **P**, then the number of wires is **3P**.

---

### Step 2: Use the given number of wires

We are told that the total number of wires is **45**.

So,

$$
3P = 45
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for P

$$
P = \frac{45}{3} = 15
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{15}
$$

The electric company needs **15 electric poles** to supply electricity in the neighborhood.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial number of people**

- Number of **men** at the beginning: **25**
- Number of **women** at the beginning: **15**

So, total number of people at the start:

$$
25 + 15 = 40 \text{ people}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Number of people who left**

After an hour, **1/4 of the total number of people left**.

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ people left}
$$

So, **30 people stayed** at the party.

---

### **Step 3: Number of men who stayed**

We are told that **22 men stayed** at the party.

So, number of men who left:

$$
25 - 22 = 3 \text{ men left}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Number of women who left**

We know that **10 people left in total**, and **3 of them were men**.

So, the number of **women who left** is:

$$
10 - 3 = 7 \text{ women left}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Number of women remaining**

Initial number of women: **15**

Women who left: **7**

So, number of women **left at the party**:

$$
15 - 7 = 8
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{8}
$$

So, **8 women are left** at the party.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find the cost of the magazine

We are told:

- A **magazine** costs **half as much as a book**.
- A **book** costs **$4**.

So, the cost of the magazine is:

$$
\text{Magazine cost} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Book cost} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
$$

So, the **magazine costs $2**.

---

### Step 2: Find the cost of the pen

We are told:

- A **pen** costs **$1 less than a magazine**.

So, the cost of the pen is:

$$
\text{Pen cost} = \text{Magazine cost} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{1}
$$

The pen costs **$1**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the total number of pencils Jam has**

- Jam has **3 boxes full of pencils**.
- Each box is **full**, so we need to know how many pencils are in each box.
- She also has **2 loose pencils**.
- The **total number of pencils** Jam has is **26**.

So, if she has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils:

$$
\text{Pencils in boxes} + \text{Loose pencils} = \text{Total}
$$

$$
\text{Pencils in boxes} + 2 = 26
$$

$$
\text{Pencils in boxes} = 24
$$

So, **each box contains**:

$$
\frac{24}{3} = 8 \text{ pencils per box}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Total number of pencils both Jam and Meg have**

- Jam has **26 pencils**
- Meg has **46 pencils**

$$
\text{Total pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72 \text{ pencils}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine how many boxes they need to store all 72 pencils**

Each box holds **8 pencils** (as calculated earlier).

To find how many boxes are needed:

$$
\frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ boxes}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{9} \text{ boxes}
$$

Jam and Meg need **9 boxes** to store all their pencils.
We are given the following information:

- **Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees**.
- **Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker**.
- **Any added liquid (including cream) also weakens the coffee**.
- Shannon’s iced coffee is cooled by **65 degrees**.
- She adds **15 milliliters of cream**.

We are to find: **How many milliliters weaker is Shannon’s iced coffee?**

---

### Step 1: Determine how many ice cubes were used

Each ice cube cools the coffee by **13 degrees**, and the total cooling is **65 degrees**.

$$
\text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{65}{13} = 5
$$

So, she used **5 ice cubes**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the weakening from the ice cubes

Each ice cube makes the coffee **12 mL weaker**, so:

$$
\text{Weakening from ice cubes} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ mL}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add the weakening from the cream

She adds **15 mL of cream**, which also weakens the coffee. So:

$$
\text{Total weakening} = 60 + 15 = 75 \text{ mL}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{75} \text{ milliliters}
$$

Shannon’s iced coffee is **75 milliliters weaker**.
We are told:

- **People can trade 2 old records for 1 new record.**
- **5 people come in with old records and leave with 7 new records between them.**
- We need to find **how many old records the 5 people brought in**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the trade rate

Each person can trade **2 old records** for **1 new record**.

So, for every **2 old records**, you get **1 new record**.

This means that for every **new record given out**, **2 old records were used up**.

---

### Step 2: Total number of new records given out

The problem says that **5 people leave with 7 new records between them**.

So, a total of **7 new records** were given out.

---

### Step 3: Calculate how many old records were used

Since **2 old records = 1 new record**, then:

$$
\text{Total old records used} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 = 14 \text{ old records}
$$

---

### Step 4: Conclusion

Therefore, the **5 people brought in a total of 14 old records**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**14 old records**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of employees**
The company has **100 employees** in total.

---

### **Step 2: Number of junior programmers**
We are told that the number of **junior programmers** is **2/5 of the total number of employees**.

$$
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
$$

---

### **Step 3: Number of senior programmers**
Since there are 100 employees total and 40 are junior, the rest must be senior:

$$
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 40 = 60
$$

---

### **Step 4: Salary of junior programmers**
We are told that each **junior programmer** is paid **$2000 per month**.

$$
\text{Total salary for juniors} = 40 \times 2000 = 80,000
$$

---

### **Step 5: Salary of senior programmers**
Senior programmers are paid **$400 more than junior programmers**. So:

$$
\text{Salary of senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
$$

Now calculate the total salary for seniors:

$$
\text{Total salary for seniors} = 60 \times 2400 = 144,000
$$

---

### **Step 6: Total amount paid to all programmers per month**

$$
\text{Total monthly payment} = 80,000 + 144,000 = \boxed{224,000}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{224,000}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

We are told:

- At the **terminal**, some people **got on** the bus.
- At the **first stop**, **5 more people got on**.
- At the **second stop**, **7 people got off**, and **8 more people got on**.
- After these changes, there were **20 people heading to the third stop**.

We need to find out **how many people got on the bus at the terminal**.

---

### Step 1: Let’s define a variable

Let:
- $ x $ = number of people who got on the bus **at the terminal**

---

### Step 2: Track the number of people on the bus after each stop

- **Terminal**: $ x $ people
- **First stop**: $ +5 $ → total now is $ x + 5 $
- **Second stop**: $ -7 $ (people get off), then $ +8 $ (people get on)  
  So net change is $ -7 + 8 = +1 $

So after second stop, total number of people is:
$$
(x + 5) + 1 = x + 6
$$

We are told that after the second stop, there are **20 people** on the bus.

---

### Step 3: Set up the equation

$$
x + 6 = 20
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = 20 - 6 = 14
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**14 people got on the bus at the terminal.**
Let's break down the problem step by step and calculate how many lollipops Oscar has at the end.

---

### **Initial amount:**
Oscar starts with **24 lollipops**.

---

### **Step 1: He eats 2 on his way to school.**

$$
24 - 2 = 22 \text{ lollipops left}
$$

---

### **Step 2: He passes 14 out to his friends.**

$$
22 - 14 = 8 \text{ lollipops left}
$$

---

### **Step 3: He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends.**

He gave away **14**, so he buys:

$$
2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ lollipops}
$$

Add that to what he had left:

$$
8 + 28 = 36 \text{ lollipops}
$$

---

### **Step 4: He eats 3 more that night.**

$$
36 - 3 = 33 \text{ lollipops left}
$$

---

### **Step 5: He eats 2 more in the morning.**

$$
33 - 2 = 31 \text{ lollipops left}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{31}
$$

Oscar has **31 lollipops** left.
We are told:

- The phone charges at a rate of **1 percentage-point every 3 minutes**.
- The phone is currently at **60% charge**.
- We want to know how long it will take to **fully charge** (i.e., reach **100%**).

---

### Step 1: Determine the amount of charge needed

Currently at 60%, so we need:

$$
100\% - 60\% = 40\%
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the charging rate in percentage per minute

The phone charges **1 percentage-point every 3 minutes**, so the rate is:

$$
\frac{1\%}{3 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{3} \% \text{ per minute}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate time to charge 40%

We need to find the time $ t $ such that:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \% \text{ per minute} \times t = 40\%
$$

Solve for $ t $:

$$
t = 40 \div \left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 4: Convert minutes to hours

$$
120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{2} \text{ hours}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Start with how many lollipops Erin has:**  
   Erin has **7** lollipops.

2. **Her mother gives her more lollipops:**  
   Her mother gives her **10** more lollipops.  
   So now she has:  
   $ 7 + 10 = 17 $ lollipops.

3. **Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella:**  
   She gives away **3** lollipops.  
   So now she has:  
   $ 17 - 3 = 14 $ lollipops left.

### ✅ Final Answer: **14** lollipops.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the rewards system**

- For every **$20** spent, the customer gets **$1 off** on their **next purchase**.
- The customer spent **$80** on their last shopping trip.
- So, they earned:

$$
\frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ rewards}
$$

Each reward is **$1 off**, so they get **$4 off** on their next purchase.

---

### **Step 2: This shopping trip**

- They spent **$43**.
- They used their **rewards** (which were **$4 off**).
- Then, they applied a **coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off**.

So, the coupon takes **twice** the value of the rewards, which is:

$$
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars off}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total discount**

They got **$4 off** from the loyalty card and **$8 off** from the coupon.

Total discount:

$$
4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars off}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Final amount paid**

Original total spent: **$43**

Minus the total discount: **$12**

$$
43 - 12 = 31
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $31**
Let's calculate the **net pay** for both jobs and then find the difference between them.

---

### **Job A:**
- **Hourly wage:** $15/hour  
- **Hours per year:** 2000 hours  
- **Annual salary before taxes:**  
  $$
  15 \times 2000 = 30,000
  $$

- **Tax rate:** 20% (total tax on income)  
- **Taxes paid:**  
  $$
  30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000
  $$

- **Net pay (after taxes):**  
  $$
  30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000
  $$

---

### **Job B:**
- **Annual salary before taxes:** $42,000  
- **Property tax:** $6,000  
- **Income after property tax:**  
  $$
  42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000
  $$

- **Tax rate on net income after property tax:** 10%  
- **Taxes paid on income:**  
  $$
  36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600
  $$

- **Total taxes paid:**  
  $$
  6,000 \text{ (property)} + 3,600 \text{ (income tax)} = 9,600
  $$

- **Net pay (after all taxes):**  
  $$
  42,000 - 9,600 = 32,400
  $$

---

### **Comparison:**

- **Job A net pay:** $24,000  
- **Job B net pay:** $32,400  

- **Difference (Job B - Job A):**  
  $$
  32,400 - 24,000 = 8,400
  $$

---

### ✅ **Answer:**
Nick will make **$8,400 more** at the job with the higher net pay (Job B).
Let's solve this step by step.

So, the number of ruined castles is:

$$
0.40 \times 220 = 88
$$

---

### Step 3: Number of **unmanned** ruined castles  
We are told:

> Half of the **ruined** castles are unmanned.

So, the number of unmanned ruined castles is:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 88 = 44
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{44}
$$

There are **44 unmanned ruined castles** in Scotland.
We are given two offers for a bookshelf and a sofa, and we need to find the **cost difference** between the two offers.

---

### Step 1: Understand the structure of each offer

#### **Furniture United:**
- **Advance payment:** $1,350

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers  
Mason needs **30 ounces** of sugar per batch of suckers.  
So for 8 batches:

$$
8 \times 30 = 240 \text{ ounces}
$$

---

### Step 2: Sugar needed for 1 batch of fudge  
Mason needs **70 ounces** of sugar per batch of fudge.  
So for 1 batch:

$$
1 \times 70 = 70 \text{ ounces}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total sugar needed  
Add the sugar for suckers and fudge:

$$
240 + 70 = 310 \text{ ounces}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**310 ounces of sugar** are needed to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.
Let's calculate the final value of Maria's shares step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Investment**

Maria buys **8 shares** at **$8 each**:

$$
\text{Initial value} = 8 \times 8 = \$64
$$

---

### **Step 2: First Year — Stock Price Increases by 50%**

A 50% increase means the price becomes:

$$
\text{New price per share} = 8 + (0.50 \times 8) = 8 + 4 = \$12
$$

So, the value of all shares after the first year is:

$$
\text{Value after first year} = 8 \times 12 = \$96
$$

---

### **Step 3: Second Year — Stock Price Decreases by 25%**

A 25% decrease means the price becomes:

$$
\text{New price per share} = 12 - (0.25 \times 12) = 12 - 3 = \$9
$$

So, the value of all shares after the second year is:

$$
\text{Final value} = 8 \times 9 = \$72
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$72}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: How many hot dogs did Luke eat?

Luke ate **2 hot dogs**.

---

### Step 2: How many hot dogs did Thomas eat?

Thomas ate **three times more** than Luke.

So,  
$$
\text{Thomas} = 3 \times \text{Luke} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hot dogs}
$$

---

### Step 3: How many hot dogs did John eat?

John ate **half the amount** that Thomas ate.

So,  
$$
\text{John} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ hot dogs}
$$

---

### Step 4: How many more hot dogs did John eat than Luke?

$$
\text{Difference} = \text{John} - \text{Luke} = 3 - 2 = 1
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.**
We are given:

- A class of **200 students** is split into **3 groups**.
- **2 of the groups are equal in number.**
- The **third group (smallest)** is **10 less than each of the other two groups**.

Let’s define variables to represent the sizes of the groups.

---

### Step 1: Let the size of the **smaller group** be $ x $.

Then, the **other two groups** are each $ x + 10 $ in size.

So, the total number of students is:

$$
x + (x + 10) + (x + 10) = 200
$$

Simplify:

$$
x + x + 10 + x + 10 = 200 \\
3x + 20 = 200
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

$$
3x = 200 - 20 = 180 \\
x = \frac{180}{3} = 60
$$

---

### Final Answer:

The **smallest group** has $ \boxed{60} $ students.
We are told:

- Farmer Brown has **60 animals** in total, all either **chickens** or **cows**.
- He has **twice as many chickens as cows**.
- We are to find the **total number of legs** all the animals have.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ c $ = number of **cows**
- $ h $ = number of **chickens**

We are given two facts:

1. Total number of animals:  
   $$
   c + h = 60
   $$

2. Number of chickens is twice the number of cows:  
   $$
   h = 2c
   $$

---

### Step 2: Substitute and solve

Substitute $ h = 2c $ into the first equation:

$$
c + 2c = 60 \\
3c = 60 \\
c = 20
$$

Now find the number of chickens:

$$
h = 2c = 2 \times 20 = 40
$$

So:
- Cows = 20
- Chickens = 40

---

### Step 3: Calculate total number of legs

- Each **cow** has **4 legs**
- Each **chicken** has **2 legs**

Total legs from cows:  
$$
20 \times 4 = 80
$$

Total legs from chickens:  
$$
40 \times 2 = 80
$$

---

### Step 4: Add them together

$$
80 + 80 = 160
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{160}
$$

The animals have **160 legs** in total.

Thus, **only 1 ball remains** with Josh on stage.

---

### **Final Answer:**
Josh starts to juggle on stage with **1 ball**. 

✅ **Answer: 1 ball**.
We are given the following information about the weights of different animals, and we're told that a **pink frog weighs 50 pounds**.

Let’s define:

- $ P = \text{weight of pink frog} = 50 $ pounds  
- $ B = \text{weight of blue beetle} $  
- $ T = \text{weight of green toad} $  
- $ S = \text{weight of yellow snake} $  
- $ R = \text{weight of red bird} $

From the problem:

1. A pink frog weighs the **same as a blue beetle**:  
   $$
   P = B \Rightarrow B = 50
   $$

2. A pink frog also weighs the **same as a green toad**:  
   $$
   P = T \Rightarrow T = 50
   $$

3. A pink frog weighs **10 pounds less than a yellow snake**:  
   $$
   P = S - 10 \Rightarrow 50 = S - 10 \Rightarrow S = 60
   $$

4. A pink frog weighs **20 pounds more than a red bird**:  
   $$
   P = R + 20 \Rightarrow 50 = R + 20 \Rightarrow R = 30
   $$

Now we have all the individual animal weights:

- Pink frog: 50 pounds  
- Blue beetle: 50 pounds  
- Green toad: 50 pounds  
- Yellow snake: 60 pounds  
- Red bird: 30 pounds  

We are asked to find the **total weight of a container carrying one of each animal**, plus the **container itself**, which weighs **20 pounds**.

So the total weight is:

$$
\text{Total weight} = (\text{pink frog} + \text{blue beetle} + \text{green toad} + \text{yellow snake} + \text{red bird}) + \text{container}
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
= (50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30) + 20
$$

Add the animal weights:

$$
= (240) + 20 = 260
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **260 pounds**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.**  
   → So far, she has **24** outfits.

2. **At her baby shower, she received twice the amount of new baby outfits.**  
   → Twice 24 is:  
     $ 2 \times 24 = 48 $  
   → Now she has:  
     $ 24 + 48 = 72 $ outfits.

3. **Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.**  
   → Adding 15 to the 72:  
     $ 72 + 15 = 87 $

### ✅ Final Answer:  
Laurel has **87** baby outfits for her baby.

### Step 1: Understand the original daily distance
Tyson runs **5000 meters every day**.

---

### Step 2: Interpret "1/5 times more meters"
The phrase **"1/5 times more meters"** means he should run **5000 + (1/5 × 5000)** meters per day.

Let’s calculate that:

$$
\frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000
$$

So, the new daily distance is:

$$
5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters}
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine how many days in June
June has **30 days**.

---

### Step 4: Calculate total distance for the month
If Tyson runs **6000 meters per day** for **30 days**, then:

$$
6000 \times 30 = 180,000 \text{ meters}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**180,000 meters** is the total distance Tyson covered in June if he followed his coach's advice.

### Step 1: Find the price of Juice Box A  
We are told:

- **Juice Box A** costs **$4**.

---

### Step 2: Find the price of Juice Box B  
We are told:

- **Juice Box B** is **$5 more** than Juice Box A.

So,  
$$
\text{Price of B} = \text{Price of A} + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the price of Juice Box C  
We are told:

- **Juice Box C** is **$7 more** than Juice Box A.

So,  
$$
\text{Price of C} = \text{Price of A} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11
$$

---

### Step 4: Find how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B  
Now subtract the price of B from the price of C:

$$
\text{Difference} = \text{Price of C} - \text{Price of B} = 11 - 9 = 2
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.**
Sure! Let's break this down step by step.

We are told:

- There are **40 tables with 4 legs**.
- There are **50 tables with 3 legs**.

We need to find the **total number of legs** from all the tables.

---

### Step 1: Calculate legs from the 4-legged tables

Each of the 40 tables has 4 legs:

$$
40 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 160 \text{ legs}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate legs from the 3-legged tables

Each of the 50 tables has 3 legs:

$$
50 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ legs per table} = 150 \text{ legs}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add both amounts together

$$
160 \text{ legs} + 150 \text{ legs} = 310 \text{ legs}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{310}
$$

The restaurant's tables have a total of **310 legs**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Total number of cookies in a bag**
Jenny buys **1 bag of cookies per week**, and each bag has **36 cookies**.

So, total cookies per week = **36 cookies**.

---

### **Step 2: Cookies given to her son**

- She puts **4 cookies in her son's lunch box** **5 days a week**.
- So, cookies for the son =  
  $$
  4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Cookies eaten by her husband**

- Her husband eats **1 cookie a day for 7 days**.
- So, cookies for the husband =  
  $$
  1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Cookies eaten by Jenny**

Now, we subtract the cookies given to the son and the husband from the total:

$$
\text{Cookies Jenny eats} = 36 - 20 - 7 = 9
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**Jenny eats 9 cookies.**
Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Original price of one shirt**: $30  
2. **Number of shirts bought**: 2  
3. **Discount percentage**: 40%  

---

### Step 1: Calculate the original total cost without discount

$$
\text{Total original cost} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the discount amount (40% of $60)

$$
\text{Discount} = 40\% \times 60 = 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Subtract the discount from the original total to get the final price

$$
\text{Final price} = 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$36**
Let's break this down step by step to find out **what percentage more** the factory is making per day now compared to when they made tractors.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate daily revenue from tractors**

- They sold **10 tractors/day**
- Each tractor made **$100**

$$
\text{Daily revenue (tractors)} = 10 \times 100 = \$1,000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate daily revenue from silos**

- They sell **5 silos/day**
- Each silo makes **$220**

$$
\text{Daily revenue (silos)} = 5 \times 220 = \$1,100
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the difference in daily revenue**

$$
\text{Difference} = 1,100 - 1,000 = \$100
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase**

To find the **percentage increase**, use the formula:

$$
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Original Amount}} \right) \times 100
$$

$$
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{100}{1,000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**They are making 10% more per day now.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year.

---

### **Step 1: Cost of Food per Year**

- Food costs **$25 per week**.
- There are **4 weeks in a month**, so:
  
  $$
  \text{Food cost per month} = 25 \times 4 = 100 \text{ dollars}
  $$

- There are **12 months in a year**, so:

  $$
  \text{Food cost per year} = 100 \times 12 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Cost of Treats per Year**

- Treats cost **$20 per month**.

  $$
  \text{Treats cost per year} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Cost of Medicine per Year**

- Medicine costs **$100 per month**.

  $$
  \text{Medicine cost per year} = 100 \times 12 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Total Annual Cost**

Now, add up all the costs:

$$
\text{Total annual cost} = 1200 \ (\text{food}) + 240 \ (\text{treats}) + 1200 \ (\text{medicine}) = 2640 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

### Step 1: Determine how many pots are needed for roses

April needs **30 pots** for the daisies, and **twice as many** for the roses.

$$
\text{Roses} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ pots}
$$

---

### Step 2: Total number of pots needed

$$
\text{Total needed} = \text{Daisies} + \text{Roses} = 30 + 60 = 90 \text{ pots}
$$

---

### Step 3: Subtract from the pots April already has

April had already bought **100 pots**.

$$
\text{Pots left over} = 100 - 90 = 10
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**April has 10 plant pots left over.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- Andrea starts with **$36**.
- She **spends $11 on a sweater**.
- She **gives her brother $4**.
- We are to find out how much **Andrea saved**.

---

### **Step 1: Total amount spent**

She spends:
- $11 on a sweater
- $4 on her brother

So, total spent = $11 + $4 = **$15**

---

### **Step 2: Money left after spending**

She started with $36 and spent $15, so:

$$
36 - 15 = 21
$$

This means she has **$21 left** after buying the sweater and giving money to her brother.

---

### **Step 3: How much did she save?**

The question asks: **How much did Andrea save?**

We assume that "saved" means the money she kept after spending. Since she had $36 at the beginning and spent $15, the rest is what she **saved**.

So, the amount she **saved** is:

$$
\boxed{21}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$21**
Let's break this down step by step to find out **how much time John spent sightseeing**.

---

### Step 1: Time spent boating and swimming

- **Boating:** 6 hours  
- **Swimming:** Half of 6 hours = **3 hours**

So, total time spent **boating and swimming** is:

$$
6 + 3 = 9 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 2: Time spent watching shows

He watched **3 different shows**, each **2 hours** long.

$$
3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
$$

This was **30%** of the total time he spent.

So, let’s call the **total time** he spent on all activities **T**.

We are told:

$$
6 = 0.3T
$$

Solve for T:

$$
T = \frac{6}{0.3} = 20 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 3: Time spent sightseeing

He spent **40%** of his time sightseeing.

$$
0.4 \times 20 = 8 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**John spent 8 hours sightseeing.**
Let's break down how much money Annabelle has and how much she still needs to save for the phone.

---

### Step 1: Initial Savings
Annabelle already has:

$$
\$80
$$

---

### Step 2: Earnings from First Job
- Hourly rate: \$10/hour  
- Hours worked: 20 hours  

$$
10 \times 20 = \$200
$$

---

### Step 3: Earnings from Second Job
- Hourly rate: \$5/hour  
- Hours worked: 15 hours  

$$
5 \times 15 = \$75
$$

---

### Step 4: Total Money Saved So Far
Add up all the money Annabelle has:

$$
\$80 + \$200 + \$75 = \$355
$$

---

### Step 5: Cost of the Phone
The phone costs:

$$
\$400
$$

---

### Step 6: Amount Still Needed
Subtract the money she has from the cost of the phone:

$$
\$400 - \$355 = \$45
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Annabelle still needs to save \$45.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Find the height of the shortest tree  
We are told:

> The shortest tree has a height of **6 feet**.

So,  
**Shortest tree = 6 feet**

---

### Step 2: Find the height of the second tree  
We are told:

> The second tree has a height of **5 feet more than the shortest tree**.

So,  
**Second tree = 6 + 5 = 11 feet**

---

### Step 3: Find the height of the tallest tree  
We are told:

> The height of the **tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined**.

First, find the total height of the two trees:

$$
\text{Shortest} + \text{Second} = 6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet}
$$

Now, the tallest tree is **twice** that:

$$
\text{Tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{34} \text{ feet}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Initial money
Dean starts with **$28**.

---

### Step 2: Cost of toys
- **Toy cars**: 6 toy cars × $2 each = **$12**
- **Teddy bears**: 5 teddy bears × $1 each = **$5**

Total cost of toys = $12 + $5 = **$17**

---

### Step 3: Money left after buying toys
Initial money: $28  
Minus cost of toys: $17  
Money left = $28 - $17 = **$11**

---

### Step 4: Mother gives extra money
Dean's mother gives him an extra **$10**.

So, total money now = $11 + $10 = **$21**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Dean has $21 left.**
Let's break down the problem step by step to figure out how many friends Morgan can invite.

---

### **Given:**
- **Total budget:** $90
- **Morgan wants to:**
  - Play **1 round of mini-golf** (costs $5)
  - Get **$5 in arcade tokens**
  - Ride **go-karts twice** (each ride costs $10)

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total cost for the activities**

- Mini-golf: $5  
- Arcade tokens: $5  
- Go-karts: 2 rides × $10 = $20  

**Total cost for activities:**
$$
5 + 5 + 20 = 30 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Subtract this from the total budget**

$$
90 - 30 = 60 \text{ dollars remaining}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine how much money is left for friends**

Assuming Morgan will **share the remaining money equally with her friends**, and that each person (including Morgan) gets the same amount, we need to know how much **each person** can be given.

But the question is:

> **How many friends can she invite?**

So we assume that Morgan will spend the remaining $60 on **friends**, and each friend gets **some amount of money**. But the problem doesn’t specify how much each friend should get.

However, there’s a standard assumption in such problems — that **each person (Morgan + friends)** gets an equal share of the remaining money.

So let’s assume that **Morgan and her friends** will split the $60 equally, and each person gets **$X**.

We don’t know X, but we can find the **maximum number of people** (including Morgan) who can be invited if they all get at least **$1** each.

That would mean:

$$
\text{Number of people} = \frac{60}{1} = 60
$$

But this seems too high. So maybe the question is asking:

> **How many friends can she invite, assuming that Morgan and her friends all get to play one round of mini-golf, have $5 in arcade tokens, and ride go-karts twice?**

In that case, we need to **find how many people (including Morgan)** can do all those things within the $90 budget.

Let’s try this approach:

---

### **Step 4: Let’s define variables**

Let:
- $ x $ = number of people (Morgan + friends)
- Each person:
  - Pays $5 for mini-golf
  - Gets $5 in arcade tokens
  - Rides go-karts twice → $20 per person

So total cost per person:
$$
5 + 5 + 20 = 30 \text{ dollars}
$$

Total cost for $ x $ people:
$$
30x
$$

We know the total budget is $90, so:
$$
30x \leq 90
$$

Solve for $ x $:
$$
x \leq \frac{90}{30} = 3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Morgan can invite 2 friends**, making a total of **3 people** (Morgan + 2 friends), since that fits within the $90 budget.

---

### 🧠 Summary:

- Total cost per person: $30
- Total budget: $90
- Maximum number of people: $ 90 ÷ 30 = 3 $
- Therefore, **Morgan can invite 2 friends**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Daily pocket money
Marisa gets **$5** every day.

### Step 2: Cost of lollipops
She buys **4 lollipops**, each costing **25 cents**.

So the total cost for lollipops per day is:
$$
4 \times 25\, \text{cents} = 100\, \text{cents} = \$1.00
$$

### Step 3: Daily savings
She saves the **change** from her daily pocket money.

So, she saves:
$$
\$5 - \$1.00 = \$4.00 \text{ per day}
$$

### Step 4: Total savings over 5 days
She does this for **5 days**, so:
$$
\$4.00 \times 5 = \$20.00
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Marisa puts **\$20.00** in her piggy bank after 5 days.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the total money Billy has
Billy starts with **$10**.

---

### Step 2: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ x $ = number of **pounds of candy** he buys.
- The **cost per pound of candy** is **$1.50**.
- So, the **cost of candy** is $ 1.5x $ dollars.

---

### Step 3: After buying candy, he has some change left

So, the amount of **change** he has after buying candy is:

$$
\text{Change} = 10 - 1.5x
$$

---

### Step 4: He spends **half of his change** on gumballs

He spends:

$$
\frac{1}{2}(10 - 1.5x)
$$

on gumballs.

Each gumball costs **$0.05**, and he buys **40 gumballs**.

So, the total cost of gumballs is:

$$
40 \times 0.05 = 2 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 5: Set up the equation

We know that the amount he spent on gumballs is equal to half of his change:

$$
\frac{1}{2}(10 - 1.5x) = 2
$$

Now solve for $ x $:

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
10 - 1.5x = 4
$$

Subtract 10 from both sides:

$$
-1.5x = -6
$$

Divide both sides by -1.5:

$$
x = \frac{-6}{-1.5} = 4
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{4}
$$

Billy bought **4 pounds of candy**.
We are given:

- Carver is **45 years old**.
- Carver is **5 years less than twice the age of his son**.

Let’s define:

- Let $ x $ be the **age of Carver's son** (in years).

According to the problem:

$$
\text{Carver's age} = 2 \times (\text{son's age}) - 5
$$

Substitute Carver's age:

$$
45 = 2x - 5
$$

Now solve for $ x $:

$$
45 + 5 = 2x \\
50 = 2x \\
x = \frac{50}{2} = 25
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Carver's son is **25 years old**.
Let's break this problem down step by step.

### **Step 1: Find the total distance of one round trip**

The train travels between three cities:

- From **City A to City B**: 75 miles  
- From **City B to City C**: 100 miles  
- From **City C back to City A**: 50 miles **less than** the combined distance of the first two legs.

First, find the combined distance of the first two legs:

$$
75 + 100 = 175 \text{ miles}
$$

Then, the third leg (C to A) is 50 miles less:

$$
175 - 50 = 125 \text{ miles}
$$

Now, add up all three legs for a full round trip:

$$
75 + 100 + 125 = 300 \text{ miles}
$$

So, **one round trip is 300 miles**.

---

### **Step 2: How many miles does the train travel in one day?**

The train makes this trip **3 times a day**, so:

$$
300 \text{ miles/trip} \times 3 \text{ trips/day} = 900 \text{ miles/day}
$$

---

### **Step 3: How many days until the train needs service?**

The train needs service every **18,000 miles**. So, divide the total miles needed by the miles traveled per day:

$$
\frac{18,000}{900} = 20 \text{ days}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{20} \text{ days}
$$

The train goes between services every **20 days**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the amount of stuffing for each bed type

- **Rottweiler bed**: 8 pounds of stuffing  
- **Chihuahua bed**: 2 pounds of stuffing  
- **Collie bed**: The **average** of Rottweiler and Chihuahua beds  
  $$
  \text{Collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Calculate total stuffing needed

- **4 chihuahua beds**:  
  $$
  4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
  $$

- **3 collie beds**:  
  $$
  3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ pounds}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Add them together

$$
8 + 15 = \boxed{23} \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **23 pounds** of stuffing.
Let's break down the problem step by step and calculate the total time John spent on his trip.

---

### **1. Outbound Trip (to friend's house)**

- **Distance:** Normally 200 miles, but he took a detour that added 10 miles → **210 miles**
- **Speed:** 70 mph

**Time = Distance ÷ Speed**

$$
\text{Time}_{\text{out}} = \frac{210}{70} = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **2. Return Trip (home)**

- **Distance:** 240 miles
- **Speed:** 80 mph

$$
\text{Time}_{\text{return}} = \frac{240}{80} = 3 \text{ hours}

**49 fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday.**
We are given:

- There are **6 girls** in the park.
- There are **twice as many boys** as girls.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of boys

Since there are twice as many boys as girls:

$$
\text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 6 = 12
$$

---

### Step 2: Add the number of girls and boys to find the total number of kids

$$
\text{Total number of kids} = \text{Number of girls} + \text{Number of boys} = 6 + 12 = 18
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{18}
$$
We are given the following information:

- Jane must score **at least 42 points** in total across **3 tests** to pass.
- She scored **15 points** on the first test.
- She scored **18 points** on the second test.

We need to find the **minimum number of points** she must score on the **third test** to meet the total requirement of **at least 42 points**.

---

### Step 1: Add the scores from the first two tests

$$
15 + 18 = 33
$$

So, Jane has already scored **33 points** in the first two tests.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many more points she needs

She needs a **total of at least 42 points**, so:

$$
42 - 33 = 9
$$

Jane needs **at least 9 points** on the third test to reach the required total.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{9}
$$

Jane must score **at least 9 points** on her third test to pass.
We are given the following information:

- **3 customers** were kicked out for **refusing to wear masks**.
- A number equals **four times that many minus 5** were kicked out for **shoplifting**.
- **Three times the number of shoplifters** were kicked out for **physical violence over goods on sale**.
- The **total number of people kicked out** is **50**.
- We are to find how many were kicked out for **other reasons**.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ M = 3 $ (number of people kicked out for refusing to wear masks)
- $ S = $ number of people kicked out for **shoplifting**
- $ V = $ number of people kicked out for **physical violence over goods on sale**
- $ O = $ number of people kicked out for **other reasons**

We are told:
- $ S = 4M - 5 $
- $ V = 3S $
- Total: $ M + S + V + O = 50 $

---

### Step 2: Plug in known values

We know $ M = 3 $, so:

$$
S = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
$$

Then:

$$
V = 3S = 3(7) = 21
$$

Now we have:

- $ M = 3 $
- $ S = 7 $
- $ V = 21 $

So far, total is:

$$
3 + 7 + 21 = 31
$$

Total people kicked out = 50  
So:

$$
O = 50 - (3 + 7 + 21) = 50 - 31 = 19
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{19}
$$

**19 people were kicked out for other reasons.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Given:
- **After scoring 14 points**, Erin has **three times more points than Sara**.
- **Sara scored 8 points**.

We are asked to find: **How many points did Erin have before she scored those 14 points?**

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationship

After scoring 14 points, Erin has **three times more points than Sara**.

This means:

$$
\text{Erin's total after scoring} = 3 \times \text{Sara's score}
$$

But we are told that **Sara scored 8 points**. So:

$$
\text{Erin's total after scoring} = 3 \times 8 = 24
$$

So, **after scoring 14 points**, Erin has **24 points**.

---

### Step 2: Find how many points Erin had before scoring 14

If Erin now has **24 points**, and she **scored 14 points** to get there, then before she scored those 14 points, she had:

$$
24 - 14 = 10
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{10}
$$

Erin had **10 points** before she scored the 14 points.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total cost of the senior gifts.

---

### **Step 1: Cost of picture frames**

- **Number of seniors**: 44  
- **Cost per frame**: $20  
- **Total cost for frames**:  
  $$
  44 \times 20 = 880
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Etching cost (20% of frame cost)**

- **Etching cost per frame**: 20% of $20 = $4  
- **Total etching cost**:  
  $$
  44 \times 4 = 176
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Total cost for frames and etching**

$$
880 + 176 = 1056
$$

---

### **Step 4: Cost of pins**

- **Number of seniors receiving pins**: 2  
- **Cost per pin**: $5  
- **Total cost for pins**:  
  $$
  2 \times 5 = 10
  $$

---

### **Step 5: Cost of cords for officers**

- **Number of officers**: 1/4 of 44 = 11  
- **Cost per cord**: $12  
- **Total cost for cords**:  
  $$
  11 \times 12 = 132
  $$

---

### **Step 6: Total cost of all gifts**

Now, sum up all the costs:

- Picture frames and etching: $1056  
- Pins: $10  
- Cords: $132  

$$
1056 + 10 + 132 = 1198
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $1198** will be spent on the senior gifts.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Original cost of the hand-painted wallpaper at the market:**  
   $400

2. **DIY saves 20% on the cost:**  
   This means Ethan pays **80%** of the original price when he makes it himself.

3. **Calculate 80% of $400:**  
   $$
   0.80 \times 400 = 320
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
The total cost for Ethan to make his own hand-painted wallpaper is **$320**.
Let's break this down step by step to find the total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale.

---

### **Step 1: Friday Sales**

- On **Friday**, the store sold **14 pairs** of tennis shoes.

---

### **Step 2: Saturday Sales**

- On **Saturday**, they sold **double** the number of shoes as on Friday.
- So, Saturday sales = 2 × 14 = **28 pairs**

---

### **Step 3: Sunday Sales**

- On **Sunday**, they sold **one-half** the amount they sold on Saturday.
- So, Sunday sales = (1/2) × 28 = **14 pairs**

However, **6 people returned** their shoes because they didn't fit. This means **6 pairs were returned**, so those **do not count as sold**.

So, **actual shoes sold on Sunday** = 14 – 6 = **8 pairs**

---

### **Step 4: Total Shoes Sold**

Now, we add up the number of pairs sold each day:

- Friday: 14 pairs  
- Saturday: 28 pairs  
- Sunday: 8 pairs  

Total = 14 + 28 + 8 = **50 pairs**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**50 pairs of tennis shoes were sold by the end of the sale.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

Tuesday's practice is **1 hour**, so:

$$
\text{Saturday's practice} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 2: Add up all the practice times for the week

- **Tuesday:** 1 hour  
- **Thursday:** 2 hours  
- **Saturday:** 2 hours  

$$
\text{Total} = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**5 hours per week**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total cost of equipment**

The company bought equipment worth:

$$
\$400,000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine the value of faulty equipment**

40% of the total amount was for faulty equipment. So:

$$
\text{Faulty equipment value} = 40\% \times 400,000 = 0.4 \times 400,000 = \$160,000
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the value of functioning equipment**

The rest of the equipment was functioning. So:

$$
\text{Functioning equipment value} = 400,000 - 160,000 = \$240,000
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$240,000}
$$

So, the company spent **\$240,000** on functioning pieces of equipment.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total number of sheep**: 30  
   - Half of them = $ \frac{30}{2} = 15 $ sheep

2. **Milk production**:
   - From **15 sheep**, Mary gets **1 kg of milk per sheep**.
     - So, $ 15 \times 1 = 15 $ kg
   - From the other **15 sheep**, she gets **2 kg of milk per sheep**.
     - So, $ 15 \times 2 = 30 $ kg

3. **Total milk collected every day**:
   - $ 15 + 30 = 45 $ kg

### ✅ Final Answer: **45 kg of milk** every day.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Total number of rolls
Mrs. Sherman made **a dozen** bread rolls.

$$
1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ rolls}
$$

---

### Step 2: Rolls given to the children
She feeds **6 children**, one roll each.

$$
6 \text{ rolls} \text{ were given to the children}
$$

---

### Step 3: Rolls left after feeding the children
$$
12 - 6 = 6 \text{ rolls remaining}
$$

---

### Step 4: Rolls broken into pieces
Each of the **6 remaining rolls** is broken into **8 pieces**.

$$
6 \text{ rolls} \times 8 \text{ pieces per roll} = 48 \text{ pieces}
$$

---

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{48}
$$

So, Mrs. Sherman fed **48 pieces** of rolls to the chickens.
We are given:

- Total number of pupils = **40**
- Half of the class likes **blue**.
- One-fourth of the **remaining** pupils like **green**.
- The rest like **yellow**.

Let’s solve step by step.

---

### Step 1: Number of pupils who like blue

Half of the class likes blue:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ pupils}
$$

So, **20 pupils like blue**.

---

### Step 2: Number of pupils remaining after blue

Total pupils - pupils who like blue:

$$
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ pupils}
$$

These 20 pupils are the ones who **do not like blue**.

---

### Step 3: Number of pupils who like green

One-fourth of the remaining (non-blue) pupils like green:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pupils}
$$

So, **5 pupils like green**.

---

### Step 4: Number of pupils who like yellow

The rest like yellow. That is:

$$
20 \text{ (remaining after blue)} - 5 \text{ (like green)} = 15 \text{ pupils}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{15} \text{ pupils like yellow}
$$
We are told:

- Lucy sells **apples at $4 per piece**.
- On **Monday**, she sold **all the apples she picked**.
- On **Tuesday**, she picked **12 apples**.
- On **Wednesday**, she picked **double the number of apples she did on Tuesday**.
- She got **$56 from selling the apples picked on Monday**.

We need to find: **How many apples did she pick over the three days?**

---

### Step 1: Find how many apples she sold on Monday

She sold all the apples she picked on Monday, and she got **$56** from selling them at **$4 per apple**.

So, the number of apples she sold on Monday is:

$$
\frac{56}{4} = 14 \text{ apples}
$$

Therefore, she picked **14 apples on Monday**.

---

### Step 2: Find how many apples she picked on Tuesday and Wednesday

- On **Tuesday**, she picked **12 apples**.
- On **Wednesday**, she picked **double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday**:

$$
2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add up the total number of apples picked over the three days

- Monday: 14 apples  
- Tuesday: 12 apples  
- Wednesday: 24 apples  

$$
14 + 12 + 24 = 50 \text{ apples}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Lucy picked a total of 50 apples over the three days.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand what is given
- Total number of socks that **need washing**: **50**
- Lindsay washes:
  - **10 pairs of socks**
  - **15 loose socks**

We are asked to find out how many **socks Lindsay has missed** (i.e., not washed).

---

### Step 2: Convert pairs to individual socks
Each pair of socks = 2 socks  
So, 10 pairs = $ 10 \times 2 = 20 $ socks

Add the 15 loose socks:  
$ 20 + 15 = 35 $ socks washed in total

---

### Step 3: Subtract from total needed
Total socks that need washing = 50  
Socks washed = 35  
So, socks **missed** =  
$$
50 - 35 = 15
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Lindsay has missed 15 socks.**
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Rachel initially bought 23 cookies.**
2. **Janet gave her 42 cookies.**

So, the total number of cookies Rachel has is:

$$
23 + 42 = 65 \text{ cookies}
$$

3. **Her brother ate 44 of those cookies.**

Now we subtract the number of cookies eaten by her brother from the total:

$$
65 - 44 = 21
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **21 cookies are left for Rachel.**
We are given the following:

- **Principal (P)** = $3,650  
- **Time (t)** = 5 months  
- **Interest rate (r)** = 10% per year  
- **Payment frequency** = monthly  
- **Number of payments (n)** = 5  

We are to find the **monthly payment (M)** that Karan must make.

---

### Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate

The annual interest rate is 10%, so the **monthly interest rate** is:

$$
r_{\text{monthly}} = \frac{10\%}{12} = \frac{0.10}{12} \approx 0.008333
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the loan amortization formula

For a loan with equal monthly payments, the formula for the monthly payment is:

$$
M = P \cdot \frac{r_{\text{monthly}} (1 + r_{\text{monthly}})^n}{(1 + r_{\text{monthly}})^n - 1}
$$

Where:
- $ M $ = monthly payment
- $ P $ = principal ($3,650)
- $ r_{\text{monthly}} $ = monthly interest rate (≈ 0.008333)
- $ n $ = number of payments (5)

---

### Step 3: Plug in the values

$$
M = 3650 \cdot \frac{0.008333 (1 + 0.008333)^5}{(1 + 0.008333)^5 - 1}
$$

First, compute $ (1 + 0.008333)^5 $:

$$
(1 + 0.008333)^5 \approx 1.0422
$$

Now plug into the formula:

$$
M = 3650 \cdot \frac{0.008333 \cdot 1.0422}{1.0422 - 1}
$$

$$
M = 3650 \cdot \frac{0.008679}{0.0422}
$$

$$
M = 3650 \cdot 0.20566
$$

$$
M \approx 3650 \cdot 0.20566 \approx 750.29
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Karan has to pay approximately **$750.29 per month**.
We are given the following information:

- **Cho** hiked at a speed of **14 km/h** for **8 hours**.
- **Chloe** hiked at a speed of **9 km/h** for **5 hours**.

We need to find how many **kilometers farther** Cho hiked than Chloe.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the distance each person hiked

**Distance = Speed × Time**

#### For Cho:
$$
\text{Distance}_{\text{Cho}} = 14 \, \text{km/h} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 112 \, \text{km}
$$

#### For Chloe:
$$
\text{Distance}_{\text{Chloe}} = 9 \, \text{km/h} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 45 \, \text{km}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the difference in distance

$$
\text{Difference} = 112 \, \text{km} - 45 \, \text{km} = 67 \, \text{km}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many silver and gold pesos Axel has.

- **Axel has:**
  - **50 silver pesos**
  - **80 gold pesos**

---

### Step 2: Determine how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.

- **Anna has twice as many silver pesos as Axel**:
  $$
  2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos}
  $$

- **Anna has 40 more gold pesos than Axel**:
  $$
  80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of pesos they have together.

- **Total silver pesos**:
  $$
  50 \text{ (Axel)} + 100 \text{ (Anna)} = 150
  $$

- **Total gold pesos**:
  $$
  80 \text{ (Axel)} + 120 \text{ (Anna)} = 200
  $$

- **Total pesos together**:
  $$
  150 + 200 = 350
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{350}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out **how much profit Millie makes per hour** that she spends running the lemonade stand.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of cups of lemonade**

- She buys enough supplies for **3 pitchers**.
- Each pitcher holds **12 cups**.
  
$$
\text{Total cups} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Total revenue from selling all lemonade**

- She sells each cup for **$1**.
  
$$
\text{Total revenue} = 36 \times 1 = \$36
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total cost of supplies**

- She spent **$18** on supplies.

$$
\text{Total cost} = \$18
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total profit**

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = 36 - 18 = \$18
$$

---

### **Step 5: Time to sell all lemonade**

- She sells **4 cups per hour**.
- Total cups = 36

$$
\text{Time to sell all lemonade} = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 6: Profit per hour**

$$
\text{Profit per hour} = \frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**Millie makes $2 profit per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.**
We are given that Mr. Ruther sold **3/5** of his land and had **12.8 hectares** left.

Let’s denote the total amount of land he originally had as **x** (in hectares).

---

### Step 1: Understand what's left

If he sold **3/5** of his land, then the remaining land is:

$$
1 - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
$$

So, **2/5 of his original land** is left, and that equals **12.8 hectares**.

---

### Step 2: Set up the equation

$$
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for x

Multiply both sides by 5 to eliminate the denominator:

$$
2x = 12.8 \times 5 = 64
$$

Now divide both sides by 2:

$$
x = \frac{64}{2} = 32
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Mr. Ruther originally had **32 hectares** of land.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of choir members**
The choir has **52 members**.

---

### **Step 2: Number of boys and girls**
- 50% of the choir are boys, so:
  $$
  \text{Number of boys} = 50\% \times 52 = 26
  $$
- 50% of the choir are girls, so:
  $$
  \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \times 52 = 26
  $$

So, there are **26 girls** in the choir.

---

### **Step 3: Performance with just female members**
The choir decides to perform with **just its female members**, so initially, **26 girls** are expected to perform.

---

### **Step 4: Half the performers can't make it**
On the day of the performance, **half the people performing can't make it**. That means:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13 \text{ girls can't make it}
$$

So, the number of girls who actually perform is:

$$
26 - 13 = 13 \text{ girls}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Teachers join the performance**
The choir’s **3 teachers** decide to sing with them.

So, we add the 3 teachers to the 13 girls who performed:

$$
13 + 3 = 16
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{16}
$$

**16 people sang in the performance.**
To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the **average of his 5 test scores**.

His test scores are:  
**65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.**

---

### Step 1: Add the scores together

$$
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = ?
$$

Let’s add them step by step:

- $65 + 94 = 159$
- $159 + 81 = 240$
- $240 + 86 = 326$
- $326 + 74 = 400$

So, the total of the scores is **400**.

---

### Step 2: Divide by the number of tests (5)

$$
\frac{400}{5} = 80
$$

---

### Final Answer:

Wilson's current math grade is **80**.

Since he needs **80 or higher** to have the car for the weekend, **he meets the requirement**. ✅
We are given:

We need to find the total cost of **6 erasers** and **8 pencils**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of 6 erasers  
$$
6 \text{ erasers} \times \$2/\text{eraser} = 6 \times 2 = \$12
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of 8 pencils  
$$
8 \text{ pencils} \times \$3/\text{pencil} = 8 \times 3 = \$24
$$

---

### Step 3: Add the two amounts together  
$$
\$12 + \$24 = \$36
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**The total cost is \$36.**
We are told that:

- James delivers **66 messages** to **Ms. Thompson**.
- He delivers **1/3 as many messages** to **Mr. Yu**.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of messages to Mr. Yu

He delivers **1/3 as many** messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson.

$$
\text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
$$

---

### Step 2: Add the messages to both teachers

$$
\text{Total messages} = 66 + 22 = 88
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{88}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the costs**

- **Ride ticket price:** $2 per ride.
- **Ride bracelet price:** $30, which gives you **9 rides** (one for each of the 9 rides at the carnival).

---

### **Step 2: What happens in this scenario?**

- **David buys a ride bracelet.**  
  - This costs him **$30**, and gives him **9 rides** (one for each of the 9 rides).
- **Dasha buys tickets.**  
  - She will buy **9 tickets**, each costing **$2**, so she spends:
    $$
    9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars}
    $$

---

### **Step 3: Total cost for both of them**

- David: $30
- Dasha: $18  
- **Total cost together:** $30 + $18 = **$48**

---

### **Step 4: What would have been the total cost if both had bought tickets?**

If **both** David and Dasha had bought **9 tickets each**, that would be:
$$
9 \text{ rides} \times 2 \text{ tickets/ride} \times 2 \text{ people} = 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ tickets}
$$
$$
36 \times 2 = 72 \text{ dollars}
$$

So, **without the bracelet**, they would have spent **$72**.

---

### **Step 5: How much did David save?**

- If both had bought tickets: **$72**
- Actual cost: **$48**
- So, **total savings** = $72 - $48 = **$24**

But we are only asked: **How much money does David save?**

David saved the **difference between what he would have paid if he had bought tickets and what he actually paid with the bracelet**.

- If David had bought 9 tickets: $9 × $2 = **$18**
- He actually paid **$30** for the bracelet.

Wait — that doesn't make sense! The **bracelet is more expensive than buying tickets**.

Hold on — let's re-evaluate.

---

### **Revised Step 4: What is David's individual cost?**

- If David had bought **9 tickets**, it would have cost him:
  $$
  9 \times 2 = 18 \text{ dollars}
  $$
- But instead, he bought a **$30 bracelet**, which gives him **9 rides**.

So, **David spent $30**, but could have spent only **$18** if he had bought tickets.

Therefore, **David saved:**
$$
18 - 30 = -12
$$

Wait — that means **he actually lost money** by buying the bracelet!

But the question says:

> "If David buys a ride bracelet and Dasha buys tickets, and they ride all 9 rides, how much money does David save?"

So, **David saves money compared to if he had bought tickets himself.**

So, he paid **$30** for the bracelet, but if he had bought **9 tickets**, it would have cost him **$18**.

So, **he actually spent $12 more** than he would have if he had just bought tickets.

So, **he didn’t save money** — he **lost $12**.

But that seems counterintuitive.

Let’s clarify again:

- **David gets 9 rides for $30**.
- **Dasha gets 9 rides for $18**.
- **Total cost**: $30 + $18 = $48
- **Alternative**: Both buy 9 tickets each → 18 tickets × $2 = $36

So, **total cost is $48 vs. $36** — meaning **they paid $12 more** when David bought the bracelet.

So, **David's individual cost was $30**, while if he had bought tickets, it would have been $18.

So, **David spent $12 more**.

Thus, **David did not save money** — he actually **spent $12 more**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**David does not save money** — he actually **spends $12 more** by buying the bracelet instead of tickets.

So, the answer is:

> **David saves $-12**, or **he loses $12**.

But since the question asks: *"how much money does David save?"*, the correct answer is:

> **David saves $-12**, or **he spends $12 more**.

However, if the question is interpreted as asking how much **money is saved overall**, then:

> **They saved $24** in total.

But the question specifically asks about **David**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **David saves $-12**, or he **spends $12 more**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of gifts
Monica has:
- 6 gifts for her family
- 4 gifts for her friends
- 2 gifts for her teachers

So, the total number of gifts is:

$$
6 + 4 + 2 = 12 \text{ gifts}
$$

### Step 2: Ribbon available
She has **144 inches** of ribbon.

### Step 3: Ribbon per gift bow
She wants to make **one bow per gift**, and she wants to use **all the ribbon** for the bows.

\frac{144 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ gifts}} = 12 \text{ inches per gift}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**12 inches of ribbon can be used for each gift bow.**
We are given:

- The **ratio** of popsicles that **Betty** and **Sam** have is **5:6**.
- The **total** number of popsicles they have together is **165**.

We are to find: **How many more popsicles does Sam have than Betty?**

---

### Step 1: Understand the ratio

The ratio **5:6** means:

- For every **5** popsicles Betty has, Sam has **6**.
- So, the total parts = 5 + 6 = **11 parts**.

---

### Step 2: Find how many popsicles each part represents

Total popsicles = 165  
So, each part = $ \frac{165}{11} = 15 $

---

### Step 3: Find how many popsicles each person has

- **Betty's popsicles** = 5 parts × 15 = **75**
- **Sam's popsicles** = 6 parts × 15 = **90**

---

### Step 4: Find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty

$$
90 - 75 = \boxed{15}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.**
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much Tim saves by canceling his $60 cable subscription and switching to streaming services.

---

### **Step 1: Cost of Cable Subscription**
Tim was paying **$60 per month** for cable.

---

### **Step 2: Cost of Streaming Services**

He gets:
- **Netflix**: $10/month
- **Hulu and Disney Plus**: Normally $10 each, but he gets a **20% discount** for bundling.

#### Calculate the discount on Hulu and Disney Plus:
- Each costs $10, so together they cost $20.
- 20% off = 0.20 × $20 = **$4**
- So, bundled price = $20 - $4 = **$16**

Now add Netflix:
- Netflix = $10
- Hulu + Disney Plus (bundled) = $16

**Total streaming cost per month** = $10 + $16 = **$26**

---

### **Step 3: Savings Calculation**

- Original cable cost: **$60**
- New streaming cost: **$26**
- **Savings per month** = $60 - $26 = **$34**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Tim saves $34 per month by cancelling his $60 cable package and switching to streaming services.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Convert all times to the same unit**

Carol's time is given in **hours** and **minutes**, so we'll convert everything to **minutes** for consistency.

- **Writing a song**: 4 hours  
  → 4 × 60 = **240 minutes**

- **Recording**: Half the time she spent writing  
  → 240 ÷ 2 = **120 minutes**

- **Editing**: 90 minutes (already in minutes)

---

### **Step 2: Find total work time**

Add up all the times:

- Writing: 240 minutes  
- Recording: 120 minutes  
- Editing: 90 minutes  

Total time = 240 + 120 + 90 = **450 minutes**

---

### **Step 3: Find the percentage of time spent editing**

Use the formula:

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Time spent editing}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
$$

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{90}{450} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **20%**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand what is being asked

Wendy wants to **place 20 more than double** the number of books in a shelving system with **6 rows and 6 columns**.

So, we need to figure out how many books that is.

---

### Step 2: Determine the total number of shelves or positions

The shelving system has:

- **6 rows**
- **6 columns**

This means there are:

$$
6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ positions (or slots)}
$$

So, Wendy wants to place **20 more than double** the number of books in these 36 positions.

---

### Step 3: Define the expression for "20 more than double"

Let’s call the number of books she will place **x**.

Then:

$$
x = 2 \times (\text{number of positions}) + 20
$$

Substitute the number of positions:

$$
x = 2 \times 36 + 20 = 72 + 20 = 92
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{92}
$$

Wendy will need to carry **92 books** to complete her task.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many **Valentine's Day cards Erica now has**.

---

### **Step 1: Start with the cards Erica made**

Erica made **20** Valentine's cards.

---

### **Step 2: Add the cards her dad brought**

Her dad brought **2 boxes**, each with **15 cards**:

$$
2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ cards}
$$

So, total cards she had before giving any out:

$$
20 + 30 = 50 \text{ cards}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Subtract the cards she gave out**

She passed out:

- **24** to her classmates  
- **5** to her family  

Total given out:

$$
24 + 5 = 29 \text{ cards}
$$

So, after giving out:

$$
50 - 29 = 21 \text{ cards left}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add the cards she received**

She received **17** cards from family and friends.

$$
21 + 17 = 38 \text{ cards}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{38}
$$

Erica now has **38** Valentine's Day cards.

Mark needs to save for **25 days** to afford the bike.
We are given the following information:

- Nancy saw **90 spiders**.
- She saw **1/3 as many millipedes as spiders**.
- She saw a number of **stink bugs equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12**.

We need to find the **total number of bugs** she counted.

---

### Step 1: Number of spiders
She saw **90 spiders**.

---

### Step 2: Number of millipedes
She saw **1/3 as many millipedes as spiders**.

$$
\text{Millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
$$

---

### Step 3: Number of stink bugs
She saw **twice the number of millipedes minus 12**.

$$
\text{Stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
$$

---

### Step 4: Total number of bugs

$$
\text{Total bugs} = \text{Spiders} + \text{Millipedes} + \text{Stink bugs}
$$
$$
= 90 + 30 + 48 = 168

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**168 bugs** in total.
We are given the following information:

- Alice is **7 years older** than Beth.
- Beth is **5 years older** than Erica.
- Erica is **30 years old**.

We need to find the **difference in age between Alice and Erica**.

---

### Step 1: Find Beth's age

Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Erica is 30 years old.

$$
\text{Beth's age} = \text{Erica's age} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35
$$

---

### Step 2: Find Alice's age

Alice is 7 years older than Beth.

$$
\text{Alice's age} = \text{Beth's age} + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42
$$

---

There are **4 weeks in a month**.

So, the number of days worked in a month is:

$$
6 \text{ days/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 24 \text{ days/month}
$$

---

### Step 3: Months in a year  
There are **12 months in a year**.

So, the number of days worked in a year is:

$$
24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year}
$$

---

### Step 4: Daily pay  
The builder earns **$50 per day**.

So, total earnings for the year are:

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the power and time usage**

- **Power of the air conditioner:** 900 watts (W)
- **Original daily usage time:** 8 hours
- **Reduced daily usage time:** 8 - 5 = **3 hours**
- **Time saved per day:** 5 hours

---

### **Step 2: Calculate energy used per day before and after**

Energy is calculated as:

$$
\text{Energy (in watt-hours)} = \text{Power (watts)} \times \text{Time (hours)}
$$

**Before reduction:**
$$
900 \, \text{W} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 7200 \, \text{watt-hours}
$$

**After reduction:**
$$
900 \, \text{W} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 2700 \, \text{watt-hours}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the energy saved per day**

$$
7200 - 2700 = 4500 \, \text{watt-hours per day}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Convert watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (kWh)**

$$
4500 \, \text{watt-hours} = 4.5 \, \text{kilowatt-hours (kWh)}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Calculate energy saved over 30 days**

$$
4.5 \, \text{kWh/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 135 \, \text{kWh}

Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the number of zebras and their stripe counts

- **Two zebras** with **17 stripes each**
- **One zebra** with **36 stripes**
- **Another zebra** with **half that many stripes** (i.e., half of 36)

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of stripes

#### Two zebras with 17 stripes:
$$
2 \times 17 = 34
$$

#### One zebra with 36 stripes:
$$
36
$$

#### One zebra with half of 36:
$$
\frac{36}{2} = 18
$$

Now add them all together:
$$
34 + 36 + 18 = 88
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the average number of stripes per zebra

There are **4 zebras** in total.

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total stripes}}{\text{Number of zebras}} = \frac{88}{4} = 22
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{22}

### **Step 1: Determine how many sandwiches are needed**

- Each sandwich serves **4 people**.
- There are **20 people** watching the game.

$$
\text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
$$

So, Tyson needs to make **5 muffaletta sandwiches**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine how much meat and cheese is needed**

- Each sandwich requires **1 pound of meat** and **1 pound of cheese**.
- So for 5 sandwiches:

$$
\text{Total meat needed} = 5 \text{ pounds}
$$
$$
\text{Total cheese needed} = 5 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the cost of meat and cheese**

- Meat costs **$7.00 per pound**
- Cheese costs **$3.00 per pound**

$$
\text{Cost of meat} = 5 \times 7 = 35 \text{ dollars}
$$
$$
\text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add the costs together**

$$
\text{Total cost} = 35 + 15 = \boxed{50} \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Tyson would spend **$50** on meat and cheese to make enough muffaletta sandwiches to serve 20 people.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information

- **Allan has twice as much corn as cannolis.**
- **He has a total of 40 cannolis in his house.**
- **He bought 60 more cannolis at the store.**
- **He also bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis.**

We are to find the **combined total** of the number of **corns and cannolis** Allan has in his house.

---

### Step 2: Assign variables

Let’s define:

- Let $ C $ = number of **cannolis** Allan originally had.
- Let $ Co $ = number of **corns** Allan originally had.

From the problem:

- He originally had **40 cannolis**:  
  $$
  C = 40
  $$

- He has **twice as much corn as cannolis**:  
  $$
  Co = 2 \times C = 2 \times 40 = 80
  $$

---

### Step 3: Account for the new purchases

- He **bought 60 more cannolis**:  
  So now, total number of **cannolis** is:  
  $$
  C_{\text{new}} = 40 + 60 = 100
  $$

- He **bought 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis** (which is now 100):  
  So he bought:  
  $$
  Co_{\text{added}} = 100 - 40 = 60
  $$

So now, total number of **corns** is:  
$$
Co_{\text{total}} = 80 + 60 = 140
$$

---

### Step 4: Find the combined total

Now we have:

- Total **cannolis** = 100  
- Total **corns** = 140

So the **combined total** is:

$$
100 + 140 = \boxed{240}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{240}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog.

---

### Step 1: Total steps Elliott wants to take in a day  
He wants to walk **10,000 steps** in a day.

---

### Step 2: Steps taken on walks to and from school  
He finished **half of his steps** on his walks to and from school.

So:

$$
\text{Steps on walks to and from school} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10,000 = 5,000 \text{ steps}
$$

---

### Step 3: Steps taken going for a short walk with his friend  
He did **another 1,000 steps** going for a short walk with his friend.

So:

$$
\text{Steps with friend} = 1,000 \text{ steps}
$$

---

### Step 4: Steps left after these walks  
After the walks to and from school and the walk with his friend, he had **2,000 steps left** to take.

That means:

$$
\text{Steps taken so far} = 5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
$$

$$
\text{Steps left} = 2,000 \text{ steps}
$$

So, the **jog** must have accounted for the remaining steps.

---

### Step 5: Steps taken during the jog  
Since he had **2,000 steps left** to take, that means:

$$
\text{Steps during the jog} = 2,000
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
$$
\boxed{2000}
$$

Elliott took **2,000 steps** during his jog.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many minutes early Toby will be.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of words in the book**

- The book is **45 pages long**.
- Each page has **200 words**.

$$
\text{Total words} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Time to read the book**

- Toby reads at a rate of **300 words per minute**.

$$
\text{Time to read} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

- Toby must be at the airport in **60 minutes**.
- He needs **10 minutes** to get to the airport.

So, the **latest time he can start reading** is:

$$
60 - 10 = 50 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Compare reading time with available time**

- It takes **30 minutes** to read the book.
- He has **50 minutes** before he needs to leave.

$$
\text{Minutes early} = 50 - 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Toby will be **20 minutes early**.

### **May:**
- **Number of employees hired:** 40
- **Hourly wage:** $15
- **Hours per week:** 40
- **Weeks in May:** 4 (assuming a standard 4-week month)

**Total pay in May:**

$$
\text{Total pay} = 40 \text{ employees} \times 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 4 \text{ weeks}
$$

$$

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Shannon will need to make **5 dozen** madeleine cookies to last her 30 days.
We are given the following information:

- Marcy makes **50,000 candles**.
- Candles are **99% guaranteed not to explode**, meaning **1% of the candles will explode**.
- Of the **more dangerous candles**, **5% have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog**.

We are asked: **How many of the 50,000 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode?**

---

### Step 1: Determine how many candles explode

Marcy says **99% of the candles do not explode**, so:

$$
\text{Percentage that explode} = 100\% - 99\% = 1\%
$$

$$
\text{Number of exploding candles} = 1\% \times 50,000 = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500
$$

So, **500 candles explode**.

---

### Step 2: Understand what "more dangerous candles" means

The problem says:  
> "5% of the more dangerous candles also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog."

This is a bit ambiguous, but we can interpret it as:

- Only **some** of the candles are "more dangerous."
- Of those **dangerous candles**, **5% also smell like wet dog**.

But we don’t know how many candles are **more dangerous** in total.

However, the key is that **only the dangerous ones** are the ones that could explode or smell like wet dog.

So we need to assume that the **explosive candles** are among the **more dangerous candles**.

So we can interpret this as:

- The **1% (500) exploding candles** are all part of the **more dangerous group**.
- Then, **5% of those 500** also smell like wet dog.

---

### Step 3: Find how many of the exploding candles smell like wet dog

$$
\text{Candles that explode and smell like wet dog} = 5\% \times 500 = 0.05 \times 500 = 25
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{25}
$$

So, **25 candles** out of the 50,000 will **both smell like wet dog and explode**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Regular price of each blouse**: $20  
2. **Discount**: 30% off  
3. **Number of blouses Misha picks**: 4

---

### Step 1: Calculate the discount amount per blouse

A 30% discount on a $20 blouse is:

$$
0.30 \times 20 = 6
$$

So, the **discounted price** of one blouse is:

$$
20 - 6 = 14
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses

$$
4 \times 14 = 56
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

The total cost of the discounted blouses is **$56**.
We are given a problem about how many apples Joanne and her sister gathered from different types of trees. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s define:

- $ J_a $: Number of apples Joanne gathers from **average trees**
- $ J_t = 30 $: Joanne gathers **30 apples** from the **tallest trees**
- $ J_s = \frac{J_t}{2} = 15 $: Joanne gathers **half this amount** from the **shortest trees**, so 15 apples
- $ J_{av} = ? $: Unknown — number of apples Joanne gathers from average trees (this is what we're solving for)

Now, her **sister**:

- Gathers **twice as many as Joanne from tallest trees**: $ 2 \times 30 = 60 $
- Gathers **3 times as many as Joanne from shortest trees**: $ 3 \times 15 = 45 $
- Gathers **none** from average trees

So, total apples gathered by **sister**:
$$
S_t = 60, \quad S_s = 45, \quad S_{av} = 0
$$

---

### Step 2: Total apples collected by both

Total apples collected by **Joanne**:
$$
J = J_t + J_s + J_{av} = 30 + 15 + J_{av} = 45 + J_{av}
$$

Total apples collected by **sister**:
$$
S = S_t + S_s + S_{av} = 60 + 45 + 0 = 105
$$

Combined total:
$$
J + S = 45 + J_{av} + 105 = 150 + J_{av}
$$

We are told that the **combined total is 500**:
$$
150 + J_{av} = 500
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ J_{av} $

$$
J_{av} = 500 - 150 = 350
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.**
We are given:

- A herd of **camels** and **dromedaries**.
- There are **180 heads**.
- There are **304 humps**.
- **Camels** have **2 humps each**.
- **Dromedaries** have **1 hump each**.

We are to find the number of **dromedaries** in the herd.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ c $ = number of **camels**
- $ d $ = number of **dromedaries**

We know:
- Each animal has **1 head**, so total number of heads is:
  $$
  c + d = 180 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
  $$

- Each camel has **2 humps**, and each dromedary has **1 hump**, so total number of humps is:
  $$
  2c + d = 304 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Solve the system of equations

From Equation 1:
$$
c + d = 180 \Rightarrow c = 180 - d
$$

Substitute into Equation 2:
$$
2(180 - d) + d = 304
$$
$$
360 - 2d + d = 304
$$
$$
360 - d = 304
$$
$$
d = 360 - 304 = 56
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{56}
$$

There are **56 dromedaries** in the herd.
Let's break down Tom's trip step by step and calculate the total distance he traveled.

---

### **First 4 Days:**
- He traveled **200 km every day**.
- So, for 4 days:  
  $$
  4 \times 200 = 800 \text{ km}
  $$

---

### **Next 2 Days:**
- He traveled **30% of the distance from the first 4 days**.
- First 4 days = 800 km  
  So, 30% of that is:  
  $$
  0.3 \times 800 = 240 \text{ km}
  $$

---

### **Next Day (Day 7):**
- He **didn't travel at all**.  
  So, distance = **0 km**

---

### **Second Week (Days 8 to 14):**
- That’s **7 days**.
- He traveled **300 km every day**.
- So, total for the second week:  
  $$
  7 \times 300 = 2100 \text{ km}
  $$

---

### **Total Distance:**
Now, let's add up all the distances:

- First 4 days: 800 km  
- Next 2 days: 240 km  
- Day 7: 0 km  
- Second week (7 days): 2100 km  

$$
\text{Total} = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = \boxed{3140} \text{ km}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **3140 kilometers**
We are given the following information:

- **Peter's locker** is **5 cubic inches**.
- **Peter's locker** is **1/4 as big as Zack's locker**.
- **Zack's locker** is **half as big as Timothy's locker**.

We need to find the size of **Timothy's locker** in cubic inches.

---

### Step 1: Find the size of Zack's locker

Peter's locker = $ \frac{1}{4} $ × Zack's locker  
So, Zack's locker = 4 × Peter's locker

$$
\text{Zack's locker} = 4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the size of Timothy's locker

Zack's locker = $ \frac{1}{2} $ × Timothy's locker  
So, Timothy's locker = 2 × Zack's locker

$$
\text{Timothy's locker} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the starting positions

- **Stanley** is at an elevation of **10,000 feet**.
- **Oliver** is at an elevation of **3,000 feet**.

### Step 2: Where is the comb?

The comb fell from **Stanley's pocket**, which was at **10,000 feet**, and it fell **4,000 feet** to a ledge below. So, the comb is now at:

$$
10,000 - 4,000 = 6,000 \text{ feet}
$$

### Step 3: How far must Oliver climb?

Oliver is at **3,000 feet**, and the comb is at **6,000 feet**. To reach the comb, he needs to climb:

$$
6,000 - 3,000 = 3,000 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Oliver must climb 3,000 feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial capital**: Mr. Josue starts with **$5000**.

2. **First bank**: The first bank gives him **$4000**.

3. **Second company**: The second company gives him **twice as much** as the first bank.  
   So, the second company gives:  
   $ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 $

4. **Total money from banks**:  
   $ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 $

5. **Total capital now**:  
   Initial capital + money from banks:  
   $ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **$17,000**
Let's solve this step by step.

### **Step 1: Start with the total number of cats**

There were **50 cats** on the rock.

---

### **Step 2: Cats carried away by the boats**

- Four boats came.
- Each boat carried **5 cats**.
- So, total number of cats carried away =  
  $$
  4 \times 5 = 20
  $$

- Subtract that from the original number of cats:
  $$
  50 - 20 = 30
  $$

So, **30 cats** are left after the boats leave.

---

### **Step 3: Cats that ran after the mouse**

- Later, **3/5 of the remaining cats** ran after a mouse.
- The remaining cats are **30**, so:
  $$
  \frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18
  $$

- These 18 cats **ran away**, so they are no longer on the rock.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate how many cats are left**

- Cats remaining before the mouse event: **30**
- Cats that ran after the mouse: **18**
- Cats left on the rock:
  $$
  30 - 18 = 12
  $$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 12 cats** are left on the rock.
Let's break down the cost of the streaming service over **2 years (24 months)** based on the pricing changes.

---

### Step 1: Understand the pricing structure

- **First 6 months**: $8 per month  
- **Next 8 months (months 7–14)**: $12 per month  
- **After that (months 15–24)**: $14 per month  

So, we have three different price periods:

| Time Period | Number of Months | Monthly Cost | Total Cost |
|-------------|------------------|--------------|------------|
| First 6 months | 6 | $8 | 6 × $8 = **$48** |
| Next 8 months | 8 | $12 | 8 × $12 = **$96** |
| Last 10 months | 10 | $14 | 10 × $14 = **$140** |

---

### Step 2: Add up the total cost

$$
\text{Total Cost} = \$48 + \$96 + \$140 = \boxed{\$284}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$284**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the prices

- **Tattered jeans cost**: $28  
- **Jogger jeans cost**: $6 less than tattered jeans →  
  $$
  28 - 6 = 22
  $$

So:
- Tattered jeans: $28  
- Jogger jeans: $22  

---

### Step 2: Total cost of both jeans

$$
28 + 22 = 50
$$

So, Cole spent a total of **$50**.

---

### Step 3: Total savings

He saved a total of **$6**.

We are told:

- He saved **1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans**.
- The rest (i.e., the remaining 2/3) was saved from the tattered jeans.

Let’s define:

- Total savings = $6  
- Savings from jogger jeans = $ \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 $
- Savings from tattered jeans = $ 6 - 2 = 4 $

So:
- He saved **$2** from the jogger jeans.
- He saved **$4** from the tattered jeans.

---

### Step 4: How much more do the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?

Wait — this is actually already given in the problem:

> "The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans."

So the **difference in price** is:

$$
28 - 22 = 6
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**The jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.**

So, the answer is:  
**$\boxed{6}$**
Let's calculate the total number of employees that can join the day trip by adding up the capacities of all the vehicles.

### Step 1: Calculate the capacity of the buses
- **4 buses**, each with a capacity of **60 employees**  
  $ 4 \times 60 = 240 $ employees

### Step 2: Calculate the capacity of the minibusses
- **6 minibusses**, each with a capacity of **30 employees**  
  $ 6 \times 30 = 180 $ employees

### Step 3: Calculate the capacity of the minivans
- **10 minivans**, each with a capacity of **15 employees**  
  $ 10 \times 15 = 150 $ employees

### Step 4: Add them all together
$$
240 + 180 + 150 = 570
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**570 employees** can join the day trip.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the total number of bird feeders

- Lillian **builds 3** bird feeders.
- She **buys 3** other bird feeders.
- So, total feeders = **3 + 3 = 6**

---

### Step 2: Understand how many birds each feeder attracts

- The **store-bought** feeders attract **20 birds** per day.
- The **self-made** feeders attract **10 more birds** than that, so:
  
  $$
  20 + 10 = 30 \text{ birds per self-made feeder}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Calculate total birds attracted

- **3 self-made feeders** × 30 birds each = $ 3 \times 30 = 90 $ birds
- **3 store-bought feeders** × 20 birds each = $ 3 \times 20 = 60 $ birds

---

### Step 4: Add them together

$$
90 + 60 = 150 \text{ birds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Lillian can expect to see **150 birds** in her garden each day.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Aleksandra paid for her dinner.

---

### Step 1: Determine the cost of the soup

- The **bagel** costs **$4**.
- The **soup** is **25% more expensive** than the bagel.

To find the cost of the soup:

$$
\text{Soup cost} = \text{Bagel cost} + 25\% \text{ of bagel cost}
$$
$$
= 4 + 0.25 \times 4 = 4 + 1 = 5
$$

So, the **soup costs $5**.

---

### Step 2: Determine the cost of the cake

- The **cake** is **half the price of the bagel**.

$$
\text{Cake cost} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2
$$

So, the **cake costs $2**.

---

### Step 3: Add up the total cost

Now we add up the prices of all the items she ordered:

- Soup: $5  
- Bagel: $4  
- Cake: $2  

$$
\text{Total cost} = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Aleksandra needed to pay **$11** for her dinner.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- Kenny wants to buy a ticket to an amusement park that costs **$100**.
- He plans to sell his **Pokemon cards** for **$1.5 each**.
- He **keeps 1/3 of the cards**.
- After selling the remaining **2/3 of the cards**, he has **$50 in spending cash**.
- He uses this $50 along with the money from the cards to **buy the $100 ticket**.

---

### **Let’s define variables:**

Let:
- $ x $ = total number of cards Kenny started with.

He keeps $ \frac{1}{3}x $ cards, so he sells $ \frac{2}{3}x $ cards.

---

### **Step 1: Money from selling cards**

Each card is sold for $1.50, so:

$$
\text{Money from selling cards} = \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = \frac{3}{3}x = x
$$

So, he gets **$x** from selling the cards.

---

### **Step 2: Total money available**

He has **$50 in spending cash**, and he also gets **$x** from selling cards.

So, total money he has is:

$$
x + 50
$$

This must be **at least $100** to afford the ticket.

$$
x + 50 \geq 100
$$

Solving:

$$
x \geq 50
$$

But we can go further — we know that **he uses all the money** to buy the ticket, which costs $100.

So:

$$
x + 50 = 100
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $**

$$
x = 100 - 50 = 50
$$

---

### ✅ **Answer:**

Kenny started with **50 cards**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of guests**
- The caterer was told to prepare for **36 guests**.

---

### **Step 2: Initial hotdog preparation**
- Most people would only eat **one hotdog**, but the caterer prepared enough for **half of the guests** to have **two hotdogs**.
- So, half of 36 is:

$$
\frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ guests}
$$

- These 18 guests are expected to eat **2 hotdogs each**.
- The other 18 guests are expected to eat **1 hotdog each**.

So, total hotdogs prepared:

$$
18 \times 2 + 18 \times 1 = 36 + 18 = 54 \text{ hotdogs}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Actual attendees**
- **40 guests** showed up.
- Everyone wanted a **second hotdog**.

So:
- Each of the 40 guests got **2 hotdogs**.

Total hotdogs needed:

$$
40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ hotdogs}
$$

But the caterer only had **54 hotdogs**.

---

### **Step 4: How many hotdogs were left over?**
$$
80 - 54 = 26 \text{ hotdogs short}
$$

So, **26 hotdogs were not enough**.

But the question asks:

> **How many guests did not get a second hotdog?**

Each guest needs **2 hotdogs**. If there are **26 hotdogs short**, that means **26 hotdogs were not given out**, and since each hotdog is for one person, that means **26 guests did not get a second hotdog**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{26}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- **Indras' name** has **6 letters**.
- Her **sister's name** has **4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name**.

---

### Step 2: Find half of the letters in Indras' name
Indras' name has 6 letters.

Half of that is:
$$
\frac{6}{2} = 3
$$

---

### Step 3: Add 4 to that number
The sister's name has:
$$
3 + 4 = 7 \text{ letters}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add the number of letters in both names
- Indras: 6 letters  
- Sister: 7 letters  

Total:
$$
6 + 7 = 13
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**13 letters** in total.
Let's calculate the total cost of Charlotte's order **before** the discount, and then apply the 20% discount.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of each item

- **Pot and pans**: $120.00  
- **Mixing bowls**: $20.00  
- **5 utensils at $5.00 each**:  
  $ 5 \times 5 = 25 $ dollars

---

### Step 2: Add up the prices before discount

$$
120 + 20 + 25 = 165 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Apply the 20% discount

A 20% discount means she pays **80%** of the original total.

$$
\text{Discounted price} = 165 \times (1 - 0.20) = 165 \times 0.80 = 132 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Charlotte's total order cost after the 20% discount is $132.00.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Find the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy.
- Skipping rope: $6  
- Board game: $11  
- Playground ball: $2  

**Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19**

### Step 2: Find out how much money Dora has.
- Savings from allowance: $2  
- Money from her mother: $16  

**Total money Dora has = $2 + $16 = $18**

### Step 3: Calculate how much more money Dora needs.
**Money needed = Total cost – Total money Dora has**  
= $19 – $18 = **$1**

### ✅ Final Answer:
Dora needs **$1 more** to buy all the items.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Prince Thaddeus
- Slew **100 dragons**.

---

### Step 2: Prince Arthur
- Slew **three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus**.
- That means:
  $$
  \text{Arthur's dragons} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
  $$

---

### Step 3: Prince Walter
- Slew **twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur**.
- That means:
  $$
  \text{Walter's dragons} = 2 \times 75 = 150
  $$

---

### Step 4: Prince Bruce
- Slew **one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter**.
- That means:
  $$
  \text{Bruce's dragons} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{30}
$$

Prince Bruce slew **30 dragons**.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total gas divided into containers**

- Total gas = **15 gallons**
- Divided equally into **5 containers**

So, each container has:

$$
\frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### **Step 2: How much gas Josey used**

- Josey needed **1/4 of a container**

So, the amount of gas she used is:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 3 = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Convert gallons to pints**

We know that:

$$
1 \text{ gallon} = 8 \text{ pints}
$$

So,

$$
\frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{6} \text{ pints}
$$
We are given the following information:

- Chips cost **40 cents** each.
- Candy bars cost **75 cents** each.
- George spent **$5**, which is **500 cents**.
- He bought **3 bags of chips**.
- After buying these, he had **1% of his money left**.

We need to find out how many **candy bars** he bought.

---

### Step 1: Calculate how much money George had left

George started with $5 = 500 cents.  
He had **1% of his money left**, so:

$$
\text{Money left} = 1\% \times 500 = 0.01 \times 500 = 5 \text{ cents}
$$

So, he spent:

$$
500 - 5 = 495 \text{ cents}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate how much he spent on chips

He bought **3 bags of chips**, each costing 40 cents:

$$
3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ cents}
$$

---

### Step 3: Subtract the cost of chips from total spent

Total spent was 495 cents.  
Subtract the cost of chips:

$$
495 - 120 = 375 \text{ cents}
$$

This is the amount he spent on candy bars.

---

### Step 4: Find out how many candy bars he bought

Each candy bar costs 75 cents.

$$
\frac{375}{75} = 5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

George bought **5 candy bars**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1:** Ray had a total of **25 lollipops**.

**Step 2:** He **kept 5 lollipops** for himself.

So, the number of lollipops he **shared** is:  
$$
25 - 5 = 20 \text{ lollipops}
$$

**Step 3:** He shared these **20 lollipops equally** with his **4 friends**.

To find out how many lollipops each friend received, divide the 20 lollipops by 4:

$$
20 \div 4 = 5
$$

**Answer:** Each of Ray's friends received **5 lollipops**.
Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Total weight of the cake**: 20 ounces  
2. **Number of pieces**: 8  
3. **Weight per piece**:  
   $$
   \frac{20}{8} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece}
   $$

4. **Rory and her mom each have a piece**, so that's 2 pieces in total.  
   $$
   2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces}
   $$

5. **Remaining cake weight**:  
   $$
   20 - 5 = 15 \text{ ounces}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **15 ounces**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Total number of oranges**

Sitti has **34** oranges, and Juris has **22** oranges.

So, total oranges =  
$$
34 + 22 = 56
$$

Let's break down the problem step by step to find the **cost per serving** of Antoine's soup.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the amount of onions needed**

- The recipe calls for **2 pounds of onions**.
- Antoine **doubles** that amount, so he needs:
  
  $$
  2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds of onions}
  $$

- Onions are on sale for **$2.00 per pound**, so the cost for onions is:

  $$
  4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Determine the cost of beef stock**

- He needs **2 boxes of beef stock**, each at **$2.00 per box**.

  $$
  2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Total cost of ingredients**

$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{onion cost} + \text{beef stock cost} = \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00
$$

---

### **Step 4: Divide total cost by number of servings**

- The soup serves **6 people**.

$$
\text{Cost per serving} = \frac{\$12.00}{6} = \$2.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\$2}
$$

The **cost per serving** is **\$2** (rounded to the nearest integer).
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- **Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.**
- **The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel.**
- **It takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.**

We are to find **how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne** so that she arrives **first**, i.e., **5 minutes before Wayne**.

---

### **Step 1: Let’s define variables.**

Let:

- $ t $ = time (in minutes) it takes Wayne to drive from his hotel to the theater.
- Then, the time it takes Bernadette to drive from her apartment to the theater is $ 4t $.

From the problem:

- It takes Wayne **4 minutes** to get to the theater → $ t = 4 $
- So, Bernadette's drive time is $ 4t = 4 \times 4 = 16 $ minutes

---

### **Step 2: Determine departure times.**

Let’s assume both start driving at the same time, and we want to find how much **earlier** Bernadette must leave to arrive **5 minutes before Wayne**.

Let’s denote:

- $ x $ = number of minutes **Bernadette leaves earlier** than Wayne.

Then:

- **Wayne's arrival time** = $ t + \text{departure time} $
- **Bernadette's arrival time** = $ 4t + (\text{departure time} - x) $

We want Bernadette to arrive **5 minutes before** Wayne:

$$
4t + (\text{departure time} - x) = \text{departure time} - 5
$$

Subtract "departure time" from both sides:

$$
4t - x = -5
$$

Now plug in $ t = 4 $:

$$
4(4) - x = -5 \\
16 - x = -5 \\
x = 16 + 5 = 21
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Bernadette should leave **21 minutes earlier** than Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.

---

**Answer: 21 minutes**.
We are given:

- The **area** of Billie's rectangular bedroom is **360 square feet**.
- The **length** of the room is **3 yards**.

We are to find the **perimeter** of the room in **feet**.

---

### Step 1: Convert length from yards to feet

Since **1 yard = 3 feet**, then:

$$
\text{Length} = 3 \text{ yards} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the area formula for a rectangle

$$
\text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
$$

We know:

- Area = 360 ft²
- Length = 9 ft

So,

$$
360 = 9 \times \text{Width}
$$

Solve for Width:

$$
\text{Width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the perimeter

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:

$$
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{98} \text{ feet}
$$
We are given the following information:

- **Elizabeth** bought:
  - 1 pack of **red** beads
  - 2 packs of **clear** beads

- **Margareth** bought:
  - 3 packs of **blue** beads
  - 4 packs of **red** beads

- Each **pack** contains **20 beads**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the number of beads each sister has.

#### Elizabeth:
- Red beads: $1 \text{ pack} \times 20 = 20$ beads
- Clear beads: $2 \text{ packs} \times 20 = 40$ beads  
- **Total for Elizabeth**: $20 + 40 = 60$ beads

#### Margareth:
- Blue beads: $3 \text{ packs} \times 20 = 60$ beads
- Red beads: $4 \text{ packs} \times 20 = 80$ beads  
- **Total for Margareth**: $60 + 80 = 140$ beads

---

### Step 2: Find the difference in the number of beads.

$$
140 - 60 = 80
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Initial Temperature:**
- The house starts at **40 degrees**.

---

### **Step 1: Baking in the Oven**

- Marcus bakes for **3 hours**.
- Every **hour**, the oven raises the temperature by **5 degrees**.
- So, over 3 hours, the temperature increases by:

$$
3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
$$

- New temperature after baking:

$$
40 + 15 = 55 \text{ degrees}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Opening the Window**

- Marcus opens a window for **30 minutes**.
- The house cools down **2 degrees for every 10 minutes** the window is open.

First, calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 30 minutes:

$$
\frac{30}{10} = 3 \text{ intervals}
$$

So, the cooling is:

$$
3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ degrees}
$$

- New temperature after cooling:

$$
55 - 6 = 49 \text{ degrees}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{49}
$$

The house’s final temperature is **49 degrees**.
We are given the times for Jon and James in a triathlon, and we need to find how long it took **James** to do the **run**.

---

### Step 1: Convert all times to minutes

- **Jon's swim**: 40 minutes  
- **Jon's bike**: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes  
- **Jon's run**: 50 minutes  

So, **Jon's total time** is:

$$
40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine James's times

- **Swim**: 10% faster than Jon → 40 minutes × (1 - 0.10) = 40 × 0.90 = **36 minutes**
- **Bike**: 5 minutes longer than Jon → 80 + 5 = **85 minutes**
- **Run**: Unknown → Let’s call this **x** minutes

So, **James's total time** is:

$$
36 + 85 + x = 121 + x \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Use the fact that Jon won by 10 minutes

This means:

$$
\text{Jon's time} - \text{James's time} = 10 \text{ minutes}
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
170 - (121 + x) = 10
$$

Simplify:

$$
170 - 121 - x = 10 \\
49 - x = 10 \\
x = 49 - 10 = 39
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{39} \text{ minutes}
$$

So, **James took 39 minutes to do the run.**
We are given the following information:

1. **Movie C** is **1.25 hours** long.
2. **Movie B** is **5 minutes longer** than Movie C.
3. **Movie A** is **one-fourth the length** of Movie B.

We need to find the **length of Movie A in minutes**.

---

### Step 1: Convert Movie C's length to minutes

Since 1 hour = 60 minutes,

$$
\text{Length of Movie C} = 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the length of Movie B

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C:

$$
\text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the length of Movie A

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B:

$$
\text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{20} \text{ minutes}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much **change** Michael has after buying the hay.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes**

- The horse runs at **32 miles per hour (MPH)**.
- 30 minutes is **0.5 hours**.

So, the distance the horse runs is:

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \, \text{MPH} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how many bails of hay are needed**

- For every **1 mile**, the horse eats **½ bail** of hay.
- So for **16 miles**, the horse eats:

$$
16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the hay**

- Each bail of hay costs **$3**.
- So, 8 bails cost:

$$
8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{\$/bail} = 24 \, \text{\$}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Determine how much money Michael has**

- Michael has **six $5 bills**.
- That’s:

$$
6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{\$}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Calculate the change**

$$
\text{Change} = \text{Total money} - \text{Cost of hay} = 30 - 24 = 6 \, \text{\$}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

**Michael has $6 in change after buying the hay.**
Let's solve this step by step.

### **Step 1: Cost of the sneakers**

The salesman bought a case of **48 sneakers** for **$576**.

So, the **cost price** (total cost) is:

$$
\text{Cost} = \$576
$$

---

### **Step 2: Revenue from Monday's flash sale**

He sold **17 sneakers** at **$20 each** on Monday.

$$
\text{Revenue from Monday} = 17 \times 20 = \$340
$$

---

### **Step 3: Revenue from the rest of the week**

He sold the remaining sneakers to a department store at **$25 each**.

Number of sneakers left to sell:

$$
48 - 17 = 31
$$

$$
\text{Revenue from the rest} = 31 \times 25 = \$775
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total revenue**

$$
\text{Total Revenue} = \$340 + \$775 = \$1115
$$

---

### **Step 5: Profit calculation**

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
$$

$$
\text{Profit} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{539}
$$

The salesman's **profit** was **\$539**.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

Beatrice bought **10 packets** of crayons. These are divided into two groups:

- **6 packets** with **8 colors each**
- **4 packets** with **16 colors each**

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of colors in the first group (6 packets with 8 colors each)

$$
6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ colors per packet} = 48 \text{ colors}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of colors in the second group (4 packets with 16 colors each)

$$
4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ colors per packet} = 64 \text{ colors}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add both amounts to get the total number of colors

$$
48 + 64 = 112 \text{ colors}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Beatrice bought a total of 112 colors of crayons.**
We are given the following information:

- **Super ticket**: $20, includes **one movie** and **one popcorn + soda** for **$1 extra**.
- **Regular ticket**: $12, plus **popcorn and soda at regular price**.
- **Soda costs $3**.
- You **did not buy the super ticket**, and **ended up saving $2**.

We are to find the **regular price of popcorn**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the cost options

#### Option 1: Super ticket
- Cost: $20
- Includes: 1 movie + 1 popcorn + 1 soda
- Soda = $3
- So popcorn = $20 - $3 - (movie cost)  
But we don't know the movie cost. However, we can compare this to the other option.

#### Option 2: Regular ticket
- Cost: $12
- Plus popcorn and soda at regular price
- Soda = $3
- Let popcorn = **P**

So total cost with regular ticket:
$$
\text{Total} = 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the savings information

You **didn’t buy the super ticket**, so you used the **regular ticket**.

You **saved $2** compared to what you would have paid if you had bought the super ticket.

So, the **super ticket price** is $20, but you only paid $15 + P for the regular ticket.

Therefore:
$$
\text{Amount saved} = \text{Super ticket price} - \text{Regular ticket price}
$$
$$
2 = 20 - (15 + P)
$$

Now solve for **P**:

$$
2 = 20 - 15 - P \\
2 = 5 - P \\
P = 5 - 2 = 3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

The **regular price of popcorn is $3**.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

\frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars per balloon}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the new cost per balloon after the increase

Two days later, the **cost of each balloon increased by $20**.

So, the **new cost per balloon** is:

$$
45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars per balloon}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price

Bentley fills **170 balloons**, and each now costs **$65**.

So, the total cost is:

$$
170 \times 65 = 11,050 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{11050}
$$

Bentley paid **$11,050** to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.
To find the **average speed** of the car during the entire trip, we need to use the formula:

$$
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
$$

---

### Step 1: Calculate the distance for each part of the trip

- **First part**:  
  Speed = 60 mph  
  Time = 2 hours  
  Distance = $ 60 \times 2 = 120 $ miles

- **Second part**:  
  Speed = 30 mph  
  Time = 1 hour  
  Distance = $ 30 \times 1 = 30 $ miles

---

### Step 2: Add up the total distance and total time

- **Total Distance** = $ 120 + 30 = 150 $ miles  
- **Total Time** = $ 2 + 1 = 3 $ hours

---

### Step 3: Calculate the average speed

$$
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{150}{3} = 50 \text{ mph}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The car's average speed during the trip is 50 mph.**

### **Step 1: Initial Value of Sapphires**

Jenna starts with **8 sapphires**.

- Each sapphire is worth **$800**.

So, the total value of the sapphires is:

$$
8 \times 800 = 6400 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Trade 3 Sapphires for 2 Rubies**

She trades **3 sapphires** for **2 rubies**.

- The value of the 3 sapphires she gives away is:

$$
3 \times 800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
$$

- She receives **2 rubies**, each worth **$1200**, so the value of the rubies is:

$$
2 \times 1200 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
$$

So, in this trade, she **gives away $2400** in sapphires and **receives $2400** in rubies. There is **no net gain or loss** in terms of value from the trade.

---

### **Step 3: Remaining Sapphires**

She started with 8 sapphires and traded 3, so she has:

$$
8 - 3 = 5 \text{ sapphires left}
$$

Value of remaining sapphires:

$$
5 \times 800 = 4000 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total Value of All Jewels**

- Value of remaining sapphires: **$4000**
- Value of rubies received: **$2400**

So, the total value of all her jewels is:

$$
4000 + 2400 = 6400 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{6400} \text{ dollars}

- There are **60% more green cards** than red cards.
- There are **as many yellow cards as the sum of red and green cards**.

We are to find the **total number of cards** of all three colors: red, green, and yellow.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of green cards

We are told that there are **60% more green cards than red cards**.

Red cards = 15  
So, green cards = 15 + (60% of 15)  
= 15 + (0.6 × 15)  
= 15 + 9  
= **24 green cards**

---

### Step 2: Find the number of yellow cards

Yellow cards = red cards + green cards  
= 15 + 24  
= **39 yellow cards**

---

### Step 3: Add up all the cards

### **Step 1: Initial Observation**

Katelyn sees **50 fairies** flying above the nearby forest.

So, at the beginning:
- **Total fairies = 50**

---

### **Step 2: After 20 Minutes**

One of Katelyn’s friends sees **half as many fairies as Katelyn saw** come from the east and join the fairies that were there.

- Katelyn saw **50 fairies**
- Friend sees **half as many**:  
  $ \frac{50}{2} = 25 $ fairies

So, **25 more fairies** join the original 50.

Now total fairies:
$$
50 + 25 = 75
$$

---

### **Step 3: Ten Minutes Later (30 Minutes Total)**

**30 fairies flew away.**

So we subtract 30 from the current total:
$$
75 - 30 = 45
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{45}
$$

**So, 45 fairies are remaining.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

8 + 12 = 20
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the total number of puppies with spots**

- Jennifer's dog has **3 puppies with spots**.
- Brandon's dog has **4 puppies with spots**.

So, the **total number of puppies with spots** is:

$$
3 + 4 = 7
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots**

We want to find what percentage **7 out of 20** is.

Use the formula for percentage:

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number with spots}}{\text{Total number}} \right) \times 100

### Initial Position:
Finley **started in first place**, so her **starting position is 1st**.

---

### Step 1: Fell back 5 spots  
Starting at **1st**, falling back 5 spots means she moves to:

$$
1 - 5 = -4
$$

So, she is now **4th from the back**, or **7th from the front**? Wait — let's clarify.

Actually, if you're in **1st place**, and you fall back **5 spots**, that means you move **down 5 positions** in the race. So:

- 1st → 2nd → 3rd → 4th → 5th → 6th  
So after falling back 5 spots, she is **6th**.

---

### Step 2: Moved ahead 2 spots  
From **6th**, moving up 2 spots:

$$
6 - 2 = 4
$$

So now she is **4th**.

---

### Step 3: Fell behind 3 spots  
From **4th**, falling back 3 spots:

$$
4 + 3 = 7
$$

Now she is **7th**.

---

### Step 4: Jumped ahead 1 spot  
From **7th**, moving up 1 spot:

$$
7 - 1 = 6
$$

So she finishes in **6th place**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **6th place**.

Let's break this down step by step.

We are told:

- Each **room** has:
  - **2 sheets**
  - **1 comforter**
  - **Twice as many pillow cases as sheets**
  - **Twice as many towels as pillow cases**

So, for **one room**, we calculate the number of each type of laundry:

---

### Step 1: Sheets
- 2 sheets per room

---

### Step 2: Pillow Cases
- Pillow cases = 2 × number of sheets = 2 × 2 = **4 pillow cases per room**

---

### Step 3: Towels
- Towels = 2 × number of pillow cases = 2 × 4 = **8 towels per room**

---

### Step 4: Comforters
- 1 comforter per room

---

### Step 5: Total laundry per room
Now add up all the items in one room:

- Sheets: 2  
- Pillow Cases: 4  
- Towels: 8  
- Comforters: 1  

Total per room = 2 + 4 + 8 + 1 = **15 pieces of laundry per room**

---

### Step 6: Total for 80 rooms
- 15 pieces/room × 80 rooms = **1200 pieces of laundry**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**1200 pieces of laundry** in 80 rooms.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Initial Information:**

- Fireman Frank starts with **200 shoes**.
- He gains more shoes over the week:
  - **Monday**: 5 pairs of shoes
  - **Wednesday**: 15 pairs of shoes
  - **Friday**: 30 pairs of shoes
- On **Saturday**, he **gets rid of 180 shoes**.
- We are to find out how many **shoes he has on Sunday**.

---

### **Step 1: Convert pairs to individual shoes**

Each pair = 2 shoes

So:

- Monday: 5 pairs × 2 = **10 shoes**
- Wednesday: 15 pairs × 2 = **30 shoes**
- Friday: 30 pairs × 2 = **60 shoes**

---

### **Step 2: Add all the new shoes to the initial amount**

Start with: **200 shoes**

Add:
- Monday: +10
- Wednesday: +30
- Friday: +60

Total added:  
10 + 30 + 60 = **100 shoes**

Now total shoes before Saturday:  
200 + 100 = **300 shoes**

---

### **Step 3: Subtract the shoes he gets rid of on Saturday**

He gets rid of: **180 shoes**

Remaining shoes on Sunday:  
300 - 180 = **120 shoes**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 120 shoes**
Let's break this down step by step.

$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Mary should bake 4 pans worth of cupcakes.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find the price of the pen
Theo bought a **pen for $2**.

---

### Step 2: Find the price of the paper
The paper costs **$1 less than three times the price of the pen**.

- Price of the pen = $2  
- Three times the price of the pen = $ 3 × 2 = $6  
- Paper cost = $6 - $1 = **$5**

---

### Step 3: Total cost
- Pen = $2  
- Paper = $5  
- **Total cost = $2 + $5 = $7**

---

### Step 4: Amount given to the cashier
Theo gave the cashier **$10**.

---

### Step 5: Calculate the change
- Amount given = $10  
- Total cost = $7  
- **Change received = $10 - $7 = $3**

Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of pencils at the start**

There are **30 students**, and each student starts with **10 pencils**.

$$
\text{Total pencils} = 30 \times 10 = 300 \text{ pencils}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Pencils used after two months**

After two months, **1/5 of the total pencils in the class were used**.

$$
\text{Pencils used} = \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \text{ pencils}
$$

So, the remaining pencils after two months:

$$
\text{Remaining pencils} = 300 - 60 = 240 \text{ pencils}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Pencils left at the end of the year**

At the end of the year, **only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left**.

That means **2/3 of the remaining pencils were used** during the rest of the year.

So, the number of pencils **left** is:

$$
\text{Pencils left} = \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \text{ pencils}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{80}
$$

So, **80 pencils were left** at the end of the year.
We are given the following:

- Matt wants to eat **5 cookies** in total.
- His dad says:  
  - He can have **half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats**,  
  - Plus **2 extra cookies for cleaning his room**.

Let’s define:

- Let $ x $ be the number of **carrot sticks** Matt eats.
- Then, according to the rule:
  - He gets $ \frac{1}{2}x $ cookies from the carrot sticks.
  - Plus 2 extra cookies for cleaning.
  - So total cookies = $ \frac{1}{2}x + 2 $

We know that Matt wants to eat **5 cookies** in total. So we set up the equation:

$$
\frac{1}{2}x + 2 = 5
$$

Now solve for $ x $:

Subtract 2 from both sides:

$$
\frac{1}{2}x = 3
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
x = 6
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Matt has to eat **6 carrot sticks**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Convert all measurements to the same unit
We are given:

- The shark is **10 feet** long.
- Each remora is **2 inches** long.
- There are **2 remoras**.

First, convert the shark’s length from **feet to inches**, since the remoras are measured in inches.

$$
10 \text{ feet} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ inches}
$$

Now calculate the total length of the remoras:

$$
2 \text{ remoras} \times 2 \text{ inches/remora} = 4 \text{ inches}
$$

### Step 2: Calculate the percentage
We want to find what **percentage of the shark's body length** is taken up by the **combined length of the remoras**.

Use the formula for percentage:

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
$$

Here:
- Part = 4 inches (total length of remoras)
- Whole = 120 inches (shark's length)

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{120} \right) \times 100 = \frac{1}{30} \times 100 \approx 3.33\%
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**3.33%** (rounded to two decimal places) of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras.
We are told:

- Three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer at home.
- 20 students **do not** have a desktop computer.

Let’s find the total number of students in the grade.

---

### Step 1: Let the total number of students be $ x $.

Then, the number of students who **do** have a desktop computer is:

$$
\frac{3}{4}x
$$

And the number of students who **do not** have a desktop computer is:

$$
x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x
$$

We are told that this number is 20:

$$
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

Multiply both sides by 4:

$$
x = 20 \times 4 = 80
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{80}
$$

There are **80 students** in the grade level.
We are given the following information:

- **Total time needed to break in shoes:** 240 minutes  
- **Time available per week:** Jason walks 4 days a week.  
- **Goal:** Find out how many minutes he needs to walk **each day**.

---

### Step 1: Total time over 3 weeks

Jason wants to break in the shoes in **3 weeks**.

So, total time = 3 weeks × 7 days/week = **21 days**

But he only walks **4 days a week**, so:

Total number of walking days = 3 weeks × 4 days/week = **12 days**

---

### Step 2: Time per day

He needs to spend a total of **240 minutes** walking.

So, time per day = Total time ÷ Number of days  
= 240 minutes ÷ 12 days  
= **20 minutes per day**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Jason needs to walk 20 minutes each day.**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find the total number of books Sarah bought**

Sarah spent **$300** on books, and each book cost **$15**.

So, the total number of books is:

$$
\frac{300}{15} = 20 \text{ books}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Divide the books equally among her 4 kids**

She gave an equal number of books to each of her 4 kids.

So, the number of books each child gets is:

$$
\frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ books per child}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Each child got 5 books.**
We are given:

- 9 kids are **allergic to dairy**  
- 6 kids are **allergic to peanuts**  
- 3 kids are **allergic to both** (dairy **and** peanuts)  
- Total number of kids in the class: **32**

We are asked: **How many kids aren't allergic to anything?**

---

### Step 1: Use the principle of inclusion and exclusion

Let’s define:

- $ D $ = set of kids allergic to dairy
- $ P $ = set of kids allergic to peanuts

We are told:

- $ |D| = 9 $
- $ |P| = 6 $
- $ |D \cap P| = 3 $

We want to find the number of kids **allergic to either dairy or peanuts**, which is:

$$
|D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P|
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
|D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
$$

So, **12 kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts**.

---

### Step 2: Subtract from total to find those not allergic to anything

Total number of kids = 32  
Number of kids allergic to something = 12  
So, number of kids **not allergic to anything** is:

$$
32 - 12 = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**20 kids are not allergic to anything.**
Let's break this down step by step:

2. **Employees per group**: 200  
   - So, total number of employees = $ 3 \times 200 = 600 $

3. **Tour guides per group**: 7  
   - So, total number of tour guides = $ 3 \times 7 = 21 $

4. **Total number of people going on the tour** = Employees + Tour guides  
   - Total = $ 600 + 21 = 621 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **621** people are going on the tour.

\text{Total plane cost} = 5000 \times 2 = \$10,000
$$

---

### **2. Hotel Cost**

- The **normal price** of the hotel is **$1500 per day**.
- The hotel is **20% more expensive** because it's a busy weekend.
- So, the **hotel rate per day** becomes:

$$
\text{Hotel rate per day} = 1500 + (1500 \times 0.20) = 1500 + 300 = \$1800 \text{ per day}
$$

- They stay for **3 days**, so:

$$
\text{Total hotel cost} = 1800 \times 3 = \$5,400
$$

---

### **3. Total Trip Cost**

Now, add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel:

$$
\text{Total trip cost} = 10,000 + 5,400 = \$15,400

Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Given:
- Each **tray** can hold **24 eggs**.
- Jaime has **64 eggs**.
- He has **2 trays**.

---

### Step 1: Find the total capacity of the 2 trays

Each tray holds 24 eggs, so:

$$
2 \text{ trays} \times 24 \text{ eggs per tray} = 48 \text{ eggs}
$$

---

### Step 2: Subtract the total capacity from the number of eggs

Jaime has 64 eggs, but only 48 can fit on the trays:

$$
64 - 48 = 16
$$

---

### Final Answer:

Jaime will be unable to place **16 eggs** on the tray.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Cost of the small pizza**: $8  
2. **Cost of the family-size pizza**: 3 times the cost of the small pizza  
   - So, $ 3 \times 8 = 24 $

3. **Total cost**:  
   - Small pizza + Family-size pizza = $8 + $24 = **$32**

### ✅ Final Answer: **$32**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much **each individual razor** costs, in **cents**, after all the discounts and coupons.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the pricing**

- **Razors per pack:** 4
- **Cost per pack:** $4.00
- **Sale:** Buy one get one free (BOGO)
- **Coupon:** $2.00 off

She is buying **2 packs** of razors.

---

### **Step 2: Apply the BOGO sale**

Since it's a **buy one get one free** deal, when you buy **2 packs**, you pay for **1 pack** and get **1 pack free**.

So she pays for **1 pack** = **$4.00**

She gets **1 pack free** = **$4.00** value

---

### **Step 3: Apply the coupon**

She has a **$2.00 coupon**, so we subtract that from the total amount she paid.

She paid **$4.00** for the first pack.

Now apply the **$2.00 coupon**:

$$
\text{Total cost} = \$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total number of razors**

Each pack has 4 razors, and she bought **2 packs**.

$$
\text{Total razors} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ razors}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Find the cost per razor**

$$
\text{Cost per razor} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of razors}} = \frac{\$2.00}{8} = \$0.25
$$

Convert to **cents**:

$$
\$0.25 = 25 \text{ cents}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Each individual razor costs 25 cents.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the cheerleader heights

We are told:

- **9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64" tall.**
- The **10th cheerleader is 60" tall.**

So, the heights of the 10 cheerleaders are:

- 9 cheerleaders: 64"
- 1 cheerleader: 60"

So the full list of heights (in inches) is:

- 64", 64", 64", 64", 64", 64", 64", 64", 64", 60"

---

### Step 2: Build the human pyramid structure

They build a human pyramid with the following layers:

- **Bottom layer**: 4 girls
- **Second layer**: 3 girls standing on top of the 4
- **Third layer**: 2 girls standing on top of the 3
- **Top**: 1 girl (the shortest one)

So, in total, that’s:

- 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = **10 girls** → Perfect, matches the number of cheerleaders.

Now, we need to determine the **total height** of the pyramid.

But here's the key: when building a human pyramid, the **height is not just the sum of the individual heights**, because people are **stacked on top of each other**.

So, the **total height** of the pyramid is the **sum of the heights of the individuals**, **but only counting each person once**, and **adding their height to the total**.

Wait — no, that’s not right either.

Actually, when you stack people in a pyramid, the **height of the pyramid is the height of the tallest person at the bottom plus the heights of the others stacked on top**.

But since they are **standing on top of each other**, the **total height is the sum of all the individual heights**, **not just the tallest ones**.

Wait — but that would be incorrect too.

Let me clarify:

In a human pyramid, the **total height** is the **sum of the heights of all the people**, **but only the height of the person at the bottom is fully counted**, and the rest are **stacked on top**, so their full height is **not added**.

Wait — actually, that depends on how they are arranged. In most human pyramids, people are **standing on top of each other**, and the **total height is the height of the bottom person plus the height of the next person above them**, etc.

So, if we have 4 people on the bottom, then 3 on top of them, then 2, then 1, the **total height is the sum of all the individual heights**.

Because each person is **standing on top of the previous layer**, so the **total height is simply the sum of all 10 people's heights**.

So, let's proceed with that assumption.

---

### Step 3: Add up the heights

We have 9 cheerleaders who are 64" tall, and 1 who is 60".

So total height in inches:

$$
9 \times 64 + 60 = 576 + 60 = 636 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 4: Convert inches to feet

There are 12 inches in a foot.

$$
636 \div 12 = 53 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**The total height of the human pyramid is 53 feet.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **How many hours does Charisma work each day?**  
   → 8 hours per day.

2. **How often does she walk?**  
   → She walks for **5 minutes every hour** she is at work.

3. **How many minutes does she walk in one day?**  
   → 8 hours × 5 minutes/hour = **40 minutes per day**.

4. **How many days is the question referring to?**  
   → 5 days.

5. **Total walking time over 5 days:**  
   → 40 minutes/day × 5 days = **200 minutes**.

### ✅ Final Answer: **200 minutes**.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the variables

- Let **Brett's current age** be **14 years** (given).
- Let **Angela's current age** be **x** years.

---

### Step 2: Understand the future condition

> "In four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now."

So:

- In 4 years, Angela will be **x + 4** years old.
- Brett is **14 years old now**, so three times that is **3 × 14 = 42**.

So we set up the equation:

$$
x + 4 = 42
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve the equation

$$
x + 4 = 42 \\
x = 42 - 4 \\
x = 38
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Angela is currently 38 years old.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of rides
Paul drives **twice a day**:
- Morning ride
- Afternoon ride

He does this for **14 days**.

So, total number of rides =  
$$
2 \text{ rides/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ rides}
$$

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of each type of ride
- Morning ride costs **$6**
- Afternoon ride costs **$2**

### Step 3: Total cost
Now calculate the total cost:

- Total morning ride cost:  
$$
14 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ dollars/morning} = 84 \text{ dollars}
$$

- Total afternoon ride cost:  
$$
14 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ dollars/afternoon} = 28 \text{ dollars}
$$

### Step 4: Add them together
$$
84 + 28 = 112 \text{ dollars}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{112}
$$

Paul spent **$112** on driving his car during these two weeks.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Find how many oranges Ashley brought

Ashley brought **5 boxes**, and each box has **10 oranges**:

$$
5 \text{ boxes} \times 10 \text{ oranges per box} = 50 \text{ oranges}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many oranges Brianne brought

Brianne brought **20 more oranges** than Ashley:

$$
50 \text{ oranges} + 20 \text{ oranges} = 70 \text{ oranges}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the total number of oranges they have together

$$
50 \text{ (Ashley)} + 70 \text{ (Brianne)} = 120 \text{ oranges}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find how many pies they can make

Each pie needs **3 oranges**:

$$
\frac{120 \text{ oranges}}{3 \text{ oranges per pie}} = 40 \text{ pies}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{40}
$$

They can make **40 Greek orange pies**.
We are given two venues with different pricing structures, and we need to find the number of guests for which the **total cost** is the same for both venues.

---

### Let’s define:

- Let $ x $ = number of guests
- Venue 1: Flat fee of $200 + $5 per guest for food
- Venue 2: $25 per guest (includes food)

---

### Step 1: Write total cost equations

#### Venue 1:
$$
\text{Cost}_1 = 200 + 5x
$$

#### Venue 2:
$$
\text{Cost}_2 = 25x
$$

---

### Step 2: Set the costs equal and solve for $ x $

$$
200 + 5x = 25x
$$

Subtract $ 5x $ from both sides:

$$
200 = 20x
$$

Divide both sides by 20:

$$
x = \frac{200}{20} = 10
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**10 guests** are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.
We are given the following information:

- Lily, David, and Bodhi collected **43 insects** in total.
- **Lily found 7 more than David.**
- **David found half of what Bodhi found.**

Let’s define variables to represent the number of insects each person found.

Let:
- $ D $ = number of insects David found
- $ L $ = number of insects Lily found
- $ B $ = number of insects Bodhi found

### Step 1: Translate the relationships into equations

From the problem:

1. **Lily found 7 more than David**:  
   $$
   L = D + 7
   $$

2. **David found half of what Bodhi found**:  
   $$
   D = \frac{1}{2}B \quad \text{or} \quad B = 2D
   $$

3. **Total insects collected**:  
   $$
   L + D + B = 43
   $$

### Step 2: Substitute the expressions for $ L $ and $ B $ in terms of $ D $

From above:
- $ L = D + 7 $
- $ B = 2D $

Substitute into the total equation:

$$
(D + 7) + D + 2D = 43
$$

Simplify:

$$
D + 7 + D + 2D = 43 \\
4D + 7 = 43
$$

### Step 3: Solve for $ D $

$$
4D = 43 - 7 = 36 \\
D = \frac{36}{4} = 9
$$

### Step 4: Find $ L $ (Lily's insects)

$$
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Lily found 16 insects.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the problem

- Mariah used **1/4 of a skein** of yarn.
- Her grandma used **1/2 of a skein** of yarn.
- Each **skein has 364 yards** of yarn.
- We need to find the **total number of yards** they used together.

---

### Step 2: Calculate how much yarn each person used

#### Mariah:
$$
\frac{1}{4} \text{ of a skein} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards}
$$

#### Grandma:
$$
\frac{1}{2} \text{ of a skein} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add their amounts together

$$
91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**They used 273 yards of yarn altogether.**

We are given the following information:

- The **chair** is **3 feet wide**.
- The **rug** is **5 feet wider** than the chair.
- The **couch** is **2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug**.

We are asked to find the **length of the couch**.

---

### Step 1: Find the width of the rug

The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair.

$$
\text{Width of rug} = \text{Width of chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the rug's width to find the couch's length

The couch is **2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug**.

$$
\text{Length of couch} = 2 \times (\text{Width of rug}) + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{18} \text{ feet}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are told:

- Suzie bought **4 packs of gum** in total.
- She got **2 packs of strawberry gum** (her favorite flavor).
- She bought **1 pack of grape gum**, which cost **$2**.
- She bought **1 pack of green apple gum**, which she paid **half as much** as the grape gum.
- In total, she paid **$7**.

We need to find out how much **each pack of strawberry gum** cost.

---

### Step 1: Find the cost of green apple gum

She paid **half as much** for green apple gum as for grape gum.

Grape gum = $2  
So, green apple gum = $2 ÷ 2 = **$1**

---

### Step 2: Add up the known costs

- Grape gum: $2  
- Green apple gum: $1  

Total so far: $2 + $1 = **$3**

---

### Step 3: Subtract from total to find the cost of strawberry gum

Total spent: $7  
Cost of grape and green apple: $3  
So, cost of strawberry gum = $7 − $3 = **$4**

She bought **2 packs** of strawberry gum, so:

**Each pack of strawberry gum cost: $4**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Each pack of strawberry gum cost $4.**
We are given the following information:

- **Frederick wants to make as many popsicle sticks as possible**.
- He has **$24** to spend on wood.
- He can get:
  - **200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood**, which costs **$4**.
  - **400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood**, which costs **$6**.
- He wants to **buy the cheapest lumber** (i.e., minimize cost per stick).

---

### Step 1: Calculate cost per stick for each type of wood

- **2 x 4**:  
  $ \frac{200 \text{ sticks}}{\$4} = 50 \text{ sticks per dollar} $

- **2 x 8**:  
  $ \frac{400 \text{ sticks}}{\$6} = \frac{200}{3} \approx 66.67 \text{ sticks per dollar} $

So, the **2 x 8** is **cheaper per stick**.

---

### Step 2: Use the cheapest option (2 x 8) to maximize sticks

He has **$24** to spend.

- Each 2 x 8 costs **$6**, and gives **400 sticks**.
- Number of 2 x 8 pieces he can buy with $24:  
  $ \frac{24}{6} = 4 $

- Total sticks from 4 pieces of 2 x 8:  
  $ 4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ sticks} $

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Frederick can make the most popsicle sticks by buying 4 pieces of 2 x 8 wood, for a total of 1600 sticks.**

$$
\boxed{1600}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of dogs**: Mario has **6 sled dogs**.

2. **Legs per dog**: Each dog has **4 legs**.

3. **Snowshoes per leg**: Since each dog has 4 legs, and snowshoes are typically placed on **both legs**, we need **2 snowshoes per dog** (one for each pair of legs).

   - So, **2 snowshoes per dog**.

4. **Cost per pair of snowshoes**: Each pair costs **$12.00**.

5. **Total number of snowshoes needed**:
   $$
   6 \text{ dogs} \times 2 \text{ snowshoes per dog} = 12 \text{ snowshoes}
   $$

6. **Total cost**:
   $$
   12 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 = \$144.00
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **\$144.00**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass for $20.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the cost of two bus trips per day**

Each bus trip costs **$2.20**, and she takes **two trips per day**.

$$
2 \text{ trips/day} \times \$2.20/\text{trip} = \$4.40 \text{ per day}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the cost for five days a week**

She does this **five days a week**, so:

$$
\$4.40/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days} = \$22.00 \text{ per week}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Compare with the cost of a weekly bus pass**

A weekly bus pass costs **$20**.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the savings**

$$
\$22.00 \text{ (cost without pass)} - \$20.00 \text{ (cost with pass)} = \$2.00
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Janet would save **\$2.00** per week by buying a weekly bus pass.
Let's go through the problem step by step and solve it logically.

---

### Given:

1. **The farm has 30 cows.**
2. **The zoo has 20 sheep.**
3. **The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.**
4. **The farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.**

We are asked to find:  
**How many animals do the farm and zoo have combined?**

---

### Step 1: Determine how many cows are at the zoo.

From point (3):  
> The zoo has **twice as many cows as the farm does**.

- Farm has **30 cows**, so:
  
$$
\text{Zoo cows} = 2 \times 30 = 60
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many sheep are at the farm.

From point (4):  
> The farm has **half as many sheep as the zoo does**.

- Zoo has **20 sheep**, so:

$$
\text{Farm sheep} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
$$

---

### Step 3: Now, sum up all the animals.

- **Farm:** 30 cows + 10 sheep = **40 animals**
- **Zoo:** 60 cows + 20 sheep = **80 animals**

Now add them together:

$$
40 + 80 = \boxed{120}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**The farm and zoo have a total of 120 animals combined.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the problem**

- Sophia and Rose went to the market.
- Rose bought **4 times** the number of onions **and** potatoes that Sophia bought.
- Rose bought **12 onions** and **4 potatoes**.
- We are to find how many **onions and potatoes in total** Sophia bought.

---

### **Step 2: Define variables**

Let’s say:

- Let $ x $ be the number of **onions** Sophia bought.
- Let $ y $ be the number of **potatoes** Sophia bought.

Then, according to the problem:

- Rose bought **4 times** as many onions and potatoes as Sophia. So:
  - Rose bought $ 4x $ onions
  - Rose bought $ 4y $ potatoes

But we are told:

- Rose bought **12 onions** and **4 potatoes**.

So we can write:

$$
4x = 12 \quad \text{(onions)}
$$
$$
4y = 4 \quad \text{(potatoes)}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ x $ and $ y $**

From the first equation:

$$
4x = 12 \Rightarrow x = \frac{12}{4} = 3
$$

From the second equation:

$$
4y = 4 \Rightarrow y = \frac{4}{4} = 1
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought**

Sophia bought:

- $ x = 3 $ onions
- $ y = 1 $ potato

So total:

$$
3 + 1 = \boxed{4}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Sophia bought a total of 4 onions and potatoes.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many **calories Andy needs to create a deficit** each day to lose 30 lbs by July 19th.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the number of days between December 31st and July 19th**

- December has 31 days, so from December 31st to December 31st is **0 days**.
- From January 1st to July 19th is:

  - January: 31 days  
  - February: 28 days (not a leap year)  
  - March: 31 days  
  - April: 30 days  
  - May: 31 days  
  - June: 30 days

$$

So, Andy has **210 days** to reach his goal.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total calories needed to lose 30 lbs**

- To lose **1 lb**, you need to burn **3500 calories**.
- So, to lose **30 lbs**, Andy needs to burn:

$$
30 \times 3500 = 105,000 \text{ calories}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate daily calorie deficit required**

$$
\frac{105,000}{210} = 500 \text{ calories per day}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Andy needs to create a **daily calorie deficit of 500 calories** to lose 30 pounds by July 19th.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Start with the initial amount**

Julie starts with:

$$
\$500
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the amount spent on clothes**

She spends **20%** of her money on clothes.

$$
20\% \text{ of } 500 = 0.20 \times 500 = 100
$$

So, she spends **\$100** on clothes.

Now, the remaining money is:

$$
500 - 100 = 400
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the amount spent on CDs**

Next, she spends **25%** of the remaining money on CDs.

$$
25\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.25 \times 400 = 100
$$

So, she spends **\$100** on CDs.

Now, the remaining money is:

$$
400 - 100 = 300
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{300}
$$

Julie has **\$300** left.
We are given:

- The total cost of the **house and the lot** is **$120,000**.
- The **house** costs **three times as much as the lot**.

Let’s define:

- Let the cost of the **lot** be $ x $ dollars.
- Then the cost of the **house** is $ 3x $ dollars.

Now, the total cost is:

$$
x + 3x = 120,000
$$

Simplify:

$$
4x = 120,000
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
x = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000
$$

So, the **cost of the lot** is **$30,000**, and the **cost of the house** is:

$$
3x = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: The house cost **$90,000**.
Let's break this down step by step to find out Tara's **profit**.

---

### **Step 1: Find the total number of bags**
Tara bought **8 packs of 5 canvas bags**:

$$
8 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ bags per pack} = 40 \text{ bags}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the bags**
Each bag costs **$4**, so:

$$
40 \text{ bags} \times \$4 = \$160
$$

This is the **total cost** (also called the **cost price**).

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the bags**
She sold each bag for **$8**, so:

$$
40 \text{ bags} \times \$8 = \$320
$$

This is the **total revenue** (also called the **selling price**).

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the profit**
Profit is calculated as:

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
$$

$$
\text{Profit} = \$320 - \$160 = \$160
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Tara earned a profit of \$160.**
Let's break this down step by step.

We are given the following information:

- **Suzanne made 36 cookies.**
- **Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made.**
- **Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh.**

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find how many cookies Josh made

Josh made **one-fourth** of what Suzanne made.

$$
\text{Josh's cookies} = \frac{1}{4} \times 36 = 9
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many cookies Kelsie made

Kelsie made **two times more** cookies than Josh.

This means:

$$
\text{Kelsie's cookies} = 2 \times \text{Josh's cookies} = 2 \times 9 = 18
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{18}
$$

So, **Kelsie made 18 cookies.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Ali has**

Ali has:

- 4 × $10 = $40
- 6 × $20 = $120

So, total money = $40 + $120 = **$160**

---

### **Step 2: Ali gives half of the total money to her sister**

Half of $160 = $160 ÷ 2 = **$80**

So, after giving $80 to her sister, Ali has:

$160 − $80 = **$80** left.

---

### **Step 3: Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount to buy dinner**

Remaining amount = $80  
3/5 of $80 = (3/5) × 80 = **$48**

So, Ali spends $48 on dinner.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Ali has left after buying dinner**

Money left = $80 − $48 = **$32**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**Ali has $32 left after buying dinner.**
We are given:

- **Rob takes 2 hours** to shingle a house.
- **Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes.**

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Convert Rob's time to minutes

Rob takes **2 hours**, and since 1 hour = 60 minutes:

$$
\text{Rob's time} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the relationship for Royce's time

Royce takes **40 minutes more than double** Rob's time.

So:

$$
\text{Royce's time} = 2 \times (\text{Rob's time}) + 40
$$

Substitute Rob's time (120 minutes):

$$
\text{Royce's time} = 2 \times 120 + 40 = 240 + 40 = 280 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{280} \text{ minutes}
$$

We are given the picking rates of four people: Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky. We need to find the **total number of quarts of strawberries** they can pick **per hour** together.

---

### Step 1: Define Tony's rate

> Tony can pick **6 quarts per hour**.

So:
$$
\text{Tony's rate} = 6 \text{ quarts/hour}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find Bobby's rate

> Bobby picks **one less quart per hour than Tony**.

So:
$$
\text{Bobby's rate} = 6 - 1 = 5 \text{ quarts/hour}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find Kathy's rate

> Kathy can pick **twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby**.

So:
$$
\text{Kathy's rate} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ quarts/hour}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find Ricky's rate

> Ricky picks **two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy**.

So:
$$
\text{Ricky's rate} = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ quarts/hour}
$$

---

### Step 5: Add up all the rates

Now we add up the hourly picking rates:

$$
\text{Total rate} = \text{Tony} + \text{Bobby} + \text{Kathy} + \text{Ricky}
$$
$$
= 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 \text{ quarts/hour}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{29} \text{ quarts per hour}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Start with the total number of loaves baked
The bakers baked **200 loaves** on Monday morning.

---

### Step 2: Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning
They sold **93 loaves** in the morning.

$$
200 - 93 = 107 \text{ loaves remaining after morning sales}
$$

---

### Step 3: Subtract the number of loaves sold in the afternoon
They sold **39 loaves** in the afternoon.

$$
107 - 39 = 68 \text{ loaves remaining after afternoon sales}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add the returned loaves
A grocery store returned **6 unsold loaves**.

$$
68 + 6 = 74 \text{ loaves remaining}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**74 loaves of bread were left.**
We are given:

- Jackson can fit **6 red tulips in a row**.
- He can fit **8 blue tulips in a row**.
- He has **36 red tulips** and **24 blue tulips**.

We need to find out how many **rows** of flowers he will plant.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the number of rows for red tulips

Jackson has **36 red tulips**, and each row holds **6 red tulips**.

$$
\text{Rows of red tulips} = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ rows}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of rows for blue tulips

He has **24 blue tulips**, and each row holds **8 blue tulips**.

$$
\text{Rows of blue tulips} = \frac{24}{8} = 3 \text{ rows}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add the rows together

$$
\text{Total rows} = 6 + 3 = 9
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Jackson will plant 9 rows of flowers.**
We are given:

- Heather has **27 cups of raisins**.
- She wants to make **3 types of things**:  
  - **Oatmeal cookies** (uses **3/4 cup of raisins per batch**)  
  - **Granola**  
  - **Snack mix**

She divides the **raisins equally** among the three things.

---

### Step 1: Divide the total raisins equally among the three uses

Total raisins = 27 cups  
Number of uses = 3 (oatmeal, granola, snack mix)

So, each item gets:

$$
\frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups of raisins}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made with 9 cups of raisins

Each batch of oatmeal cookies uses **3/4 cup of raisins**.

So, number of batches is:

$$
\frac{9}{\frac{3}{4}} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{36}{3} = 12
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Heather can make **12 batches of oatmeal cookies**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**

- **Ada’s current daily electric consumption:**  
  $ 12 $ kilowatts per hour (kWh)

- **New device consumption:**  
  $ 2 $ kWh per day

- **Cost per kWh:**  
  $ \$1.50 $

- **We are asked to find the difference in Ada’s **weekly** electric bill** before and after adding the new device.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the cost per day before adding the new device**

$$
\text{Daily cost} = 12 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$18.00 \text{ per day}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the cost per day after adding the new device**

$$
\text{New daily consumption} = 12 + 2 = 14 \, \text{kWh/day}
$$

$$
\text{New daily cost} = 14 \, \text{kWh/day} \times \$1.50/\text{kWh} = \$21.00 \text{ per day}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Find the difference in daily cost**

$$
\text{Daily cost difference} = \$21.00 - \$18.00 = \$3.00 \text{ per day}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Find the weekly cost difference**

$$
\text{Weekly cost difference} = \$3.00/\text{day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = \$21.00
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$21.00}
$$

The difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after she adds the new device is **\$21.00**.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**

We are told:

- **One person can paint half a house in 5 days.**

So, we need to find out how long it would take **5 people** to paint **a whole house**.

---

### **Step 2: Find the rate of one person**

If one person paints **half a house in 5 days**, then:

- In 5 days, 1 person paints **½ house**.
- So, in **1 day**, 1 person paints:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \div 5 = \frac{1}{10} \text{ of a house per day}
$$

So, **one person’s rate is** $ \frac{1}{10} $ house/day.

---

### **Step 3: Find the total work required**

We want to paint **1 full house**.

So, the total amount of work needed is **1 house**.

---

### **Step 4: Find the combined rate of 5 people**

Each person paints $ \frac{1}{10} $ house/day.

So, 5 people together paint:

$$
5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}
$$

So, **5 people can paint half a house in 1 day**.

---

### **Step 5: How long does it take to paint 1 full house?**

If 5 people paint **½ house in 1 day**, then they paint **1 full house in**:

$$
1 \div \frac{1}{2} = 2 \text{ days}
$$

---

### **Step 6: Convert days to hours (if needed)**

Assuming a **day = 24 hours**, then:

$$
2 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 48 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

It would take **48 hours** for 5 people to paint a whole house.
We are given the following information:

- Ophelia and Jenna live in the same apartment building.
- Each has **2 fewer sofas than chairs**.
- **Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia**.
- **Ophelia has 20 sofas**.

We need to find the **total number of sofas and chairs** that both Ophelia and Jenna have.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s define:

- Let $ C_O $ be the number of **chairs Ophelia has**.
- Then, since Ophelia has **2 fewer sofas than chairs**, she has $ C_O - 2 $ sofas.

But we are told that **Ophelia has 20 sofas**. So:

$$
C_O - 2 = 20 \Rightarrow C_O = 22
$$

So, **Ophelia has 22 chairs** and **20 sofas**.

---

### Step 2: Use the relationship between Jenna's chairs and Ophelia's chairs

We’re told:

> **Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia**

So:

$$
C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66
$$

So, **Jenna has 66 chairs**.

Since Jenna also has **2 fewer sofas than chairs**, her number of sofas is:

$$
S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64
$$

So, **Jenna has 64 sofas**.

---

### Step 3: Add up all the furniture

Now, let's add up all the **sofas** and **chairs** that Ophelia and Jenna have:

- **Ophelia**:
  - Chairs: 22
  - Sofas: 20

- **Jenna**:
  - Chairs: 66
  - Sofas: 64

Total chairs:

$$
22 + 66 = 88
$$

Total sofas:

$$
20 + 64 = 84
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\text{Total number of sofas and chairs} = 88 + 84 = \boxed{172}
$$
We are given:

- Tom bought **1 CD** for **$4**.
- He also bought a **headphone set**.
- The **total cost** was **$48**.

We are asked: **How many more CDs would Tom have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set?**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ C = $ price of one CD = $4
- $ H = $ price of the headphone set (unknown)
- Total amount spent = $48

So, we know:

$$
C + H = 48
$$

Substitute $ C = 4 $:

$$
4 + H = 48
$$

Solve for $ H $:

$$
H = 48 - 4 = 44
$$

So, the headphone set cost **$44**.

---

### Step 2: How many CDs could he have bought with the total money?

If he had not bought the headphone set, he would have used all $48 to buy CDs.

Each CD costs $4, so the number of CDs he could buy is:

$$
\frac{48}{4} = 12
$$

He already bought **1 CD**, so the number of **additional** CDs he could have bought is:

$$
12 - 1 = 11
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had not bought the headphone set.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of weeks**
Josh tracked his workout routine for **8 weeks**.

---

### **Step 2: Normal workout hours per week**
He worked out **4 hours every week**, **except on some occasions**.  
So, if there were **no exceptions**, he would have:

$$
8 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} = 32 \text{ hours}
$$

But we are told that **some weeks had more than 4 hours**.

---

### **Step 3: Exceptional weeks**

- **One time**, he spent **5 hours each for two consecutive weeks**:
  $$
  5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours}
  $$

- **Another time**, he spent **6 hours in one week**:
  $$
  6 \text{ hours}
  $$

So, the total extra hours compared to the normal 4 hours per week is:
$$
10 + 6 = 16 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total workout hours**

Add the extra hours to the normal total:

$$
32 \text{ hours (normal)} + 16 \text{ hours (extra)} = \boxed{48} \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{48} \text{ hours}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Initial number of passengers:**
There are **48 people** on the bus initially.

---

### **First stop:**

- **8 passengers get off.**
- Then, **5 times as many people as those who got off get on.**

So, 5 × 8 = **40 passengers get on**.

Now, let's calculate the number of passengers after the first stop:

$$
48 - 8 + 40 = 80
$$

So, **80 passengers are on the bus after the first stop**.

---

### **Second stop:**

- **21 passengers get off.**
- Then, **3 times fewer passengers get on.**

"3 times fewer" means **one-third** of the number that got off.

So, 21 ÷ 3 = **7 passengers get on**.

Now, calculate the number of passengers after the second stop:

$$
80 - 21 + 7 = 66
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{66}
$$

**66 passengers are riding the bus after the second stop.**
We are given:

- **Jame will turn 27 in 5 years.**
- **In 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age at that time.**
- We need to find **how many years separate their ages now**.

---

### Step 1: Find Jame's current age

Jame will be **27 in 5 years**, so:

$$
\text{Jame's current age} = 27 - 5 = 22
$$

---

### Step 2: Let the cousin's current age be $ x $

We are told:

> In 8 years, his cousin will be **5 years younger than twice Jame's age** at that time.

So, in 8 years:

- Jame's age will be: $ 22 + 8 = 30 $
- Twice Jame's age: $ 2 \times 30 = 60 $
- Cousin's age in 8 years: $ 60 - 5 = 55 $

Therefore, the cousin's current age is:

$$
x = 55 - 8 = 47
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the difference in their current ages

- Jame is **22**
- Cousin is **47**

$$
\text{Difference} = 47 - 22 = 25
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{25}
$$

So, **25 years** separate their ages now.
We are given the following information:

- Errol bought a **computer**, **2 monitors**, and a **printer** for **$2,400**.
- He paid **$400 less** for the **printer** than the **computer**.
- The **computer cost $1,100**.

We are asked to find the **cost of one monitor**.

---

### Step 1: Find the cost of the printer

He paid **$400 less** for the printer than the computer.

- Cost of computer = $1,100  
- Cost of printer = $1,100 - $400 = **$700**

---

### Step 2: Let the cost of one monitor be **x**

He bought **2 monitors**, so the total cost of the monitors is:

- 2 × x = **2x**

---

### Step 3: Add up all the costs

Total cost = cost of computer + cost of printer + cost of 2 monitors

$$
\text{Total} = 1100 + 700 + 2x = 2400
$$

Now solve for **x**:

$$
1100 + 700 + 2x = 2400 \\
1800 + 2x = 2400 \\
2x = 2400 - 1800 = 600 \\
x = \frac{600}{2} = 300
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**One monitor cost $300.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the group sizes**

- There are **20 kids** in total.
- They are divided into **two equal groups**: **girls and boys**.
- So, each group has:
  $$
  \frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ kids}
  $$

So, there are **10 boys** and **10 girls**.

---

### **Step 2: Shells brought by the boys**

- Each boy brought back **60 shells**.
- So, the total number of shells brought by the boys is:
  $$
  10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ shells}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Shells brought by the girls**

We are told:

> "The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys."

This means:

$$
\text{Shells brought by girls} = \text{Shells brought by boys} + 4 \times \text{Shells brought by boys}
$$

Let’s write that out numerically:

$$
\text{Girls' shells} = 600 + 4 \times 600 = 600 + 2400 = 3000 \text{ shells}
$$

So, the **girls brought a total of 3000 shells**.

---

### **Step 4: How many shells did each girl bring?**

There are **10 girls**, so we divide the total shells by 10:

$$
\frac{3000}{10} = 300
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Each girl brought **300 seashells**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand what we know

- **Nick had twice as many candies as George.**
- **George ate 5 candies.**
- **Now George has 3 candies left.**

We are asked to find out **how many candies Nick has**.

---

### Step 2: Find out how many candies George originally had

George now has 3 candies left after eating 5. So, before he ate them, he had:

$$
3 + 5 = 8 \text{ candies}
$$

So, **George originally had 8 candies**.

---

### Step 3: Use the fact that Nick had twice as many candies as George

Nick had **twice as many** candies as George originally had.

$$
\text{Nick's candies} = 2 \times 8 = 16
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{16}
$$

Nick has **16 candies**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

**Step 1:**  
We are told that **Chenny is 10 years old**.

$$
\text{Chenny's age} = 10
$$

---

**Step 2:**  
Alyana is **4 years younger than Chenny**.

$$
\text{Alyana's age} = \text{Chenny's age} - 4 = 10 - 4 = 6
$$

---

**Step 3:**  
Anne is **2 years older than Alyana**.

$$
\text{Anne's age} = \text{Alyana's age} + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8
$$

---

**Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{8}
$$

So, **Anne is 8 years old**.
Let's break this down step by step to find the **total thickness** of the four books.

---

### Step 1: Thickness of the first book  
We are told:

> The first book is **31 mm thick**.

So,  
**Book 1 = 31 mm**

---

### Step 2: Thickness of the second book  
We are told:

> The second book is **50 mm thick**.

So,  
**Book 2 = 50 mm**

---

### Step 3: Thickness of the third book  
We are told:

> The third book is **5 mm less thick than the second book**.

So,  
**Book 3 = Book 2 - 5 mm = 50 mm - 5 mm = 45 mm**

---

### Step 4: Thickness of the fourth book  
We are told:

> The fourth book is **twice as thick as the first book**.

So,  
**Book 4 = 2 × Book 1 = 2 × 31 mm = 62 mm**

---

### Step 5: Add up all the thicknesses

Now we add the thicknesses of all four books:

$$
\text{Total thickness} = \text{Book 1} + \text{Book 2} + \text{Book 3} + \text{Book 4}
$$
$$
= 31 + 50 + 45 + 62
$$

Let’s compute:

- $31 + 50 = 81$
- $45 + 62 = 107$
- $81 + 107 = 188$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{188} \text{ mm}

$$

---

### **Answer: Emma needs to make **18 more vlogs** in the remaining weeks of the month to complete her goal of 72 vlogs.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total dinner bill**: $50

2. **Evenly splitting the check**:  
   Since you and your wife are splitting the bill evenly, each of you would pay:  
   $$
   \frac{50}{2} = 25
   $$

3. **Additional 20% tip on the total bill**:  
   The tip is 20% of the $50 bill:  
   $$
   0.20 \times 50 = 10
   $$

4. **Total amount to be paid (bill + tip)**:  
   $$
   50 + 10 = 60
   $$

5. **Splitting the total amount (bill + tip) evenly**:  
   $$
   \frac{60}{2} = 30
   $$

So, **you end up paying $30**.

### Final Answer: $30
Let's break down the problem step by step and solve it logically.

---

### **Step 1: Total money shared among 3 boys**
The total amount of money is **$18**, shared among **3 boys**. So, each boy gets:

$$
\frac{18}{3} = \$6
$$

So, **each boy starts with $6**.

---

### **Step 2: Eldest adds money**
- **First, he adds $5 to his share:**

$$
6 + 5 = \$11
$$

- **Then the next day, he adds another $10:**

$$
11 + 10 = \$21
$$

So, after these two additions, the **eldest has $21**.

---

### **Step 3: He spends $8**
He later needs some money and **spends $8 from his total so far**:

$$
21 - 8 = \$13
$$

So now he has **$13** left after spending $8.

---

### **Step 4: He saves more and triples the amount**
He then **saves some more money**, and **triples the amount he had left after spending the $8**.

That means he ends up with:

$$
3 \times 13 = \$39
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{39}
$$

So, the eldest now has **\$39**.
We are given:

- Elvis wants to save a **total of $1125** in April.
- He saves **twice as much per day** in the **second half** of the month as he does in the **first half**.
- April has **30 days**.

---

### Step 1: Divide the month into two halves

- First half of April: 15 days
- Second half of April: 15 days

Let’s let:

- $ x $ = amount saved per day in the **first half**
- Then, $ 2x $ = amount saved per day in the **second half**

---

### Step 2: Write the total savings equation

Total savings = (amount saved in first half) + (amount saved in second half)

$$
\text{Total} = 15x + 15(2x)
$$

$$
\text{Total} = 15x + 30x = 45x
$$

We know the total is $1125:

$$
45x = 1125
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
$$

So, Elvis saves **$25 per day** in the **first half**, and **$50 per day** in the **second half**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Elvis has to save **$50 per day** in the second half of the month.
Let's calculate the total cost of the fruits Verna bought and then find out how much change she received after paying with a $20 bill.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of each type of fruit

- **Apples**:  
  3 apples × $1.50 each = $4.50

- **Oranges**:  
  5 oranges × $0.80 each = $4.00

- **Peaches**:  
  6 peaches × $0.75 each = $4.50

---

### Step 2: Add up the total cost

$$
\$4.50 + \$4.00 + \$4.50 = \$13.00
$$

---

### Step 3: Subtract the total cost from $20 to find the change

$$
\$20.00 - \$13.00 = \$7.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Verna received $7.00 in change.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how much Jairus earns per task
- Jairus gets **$0.8** per task.

### Step 2: Determine how much Jenny earns per task
- Jenny gets **$0.5** per task.

### Step 3: Calculate total earnings for each
- Both finished **20 tasks**.

So:
- **Jairus's total earnings** = $ 20 \times 0.8 = 16 $
- **Jenny's total earnings** = $ 20 \times 0.5 = 10 $

### Step 4: Find the difference
- Difference = $ 16 - 10 = 6 $

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.**
We are told that **Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad**, and the **total amount is $100**.

Let’s define:

- Let $ B $ be the amount Brad gets.
- Then Jeff gets $ 4B $.

Since the total is $100, we can write the equation:

$$
B + 4B = 100
$$

$$
5B = 100
$$

Now divide both sides by 5:

$$
B = \frac{100}{5} = 20
$$

So Brad gets **$20**, and Jeff gets:

$$
4B = 4 \times 20 = 80
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **Jeff gets $80.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Distance to work**: 3 miles  
2. **He walks there and back each day he works**  
   - So, one way is 3 miles, and the return trip is also 3 miles.  
   - That means **each day he walks: 3 + 3 = 6 miles**

3. **He works 5 days a week**  
   - So, in one week, he walks:  
     $ 6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ miles} $

### ✅ Final Answer: **30 miles**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

Elise is learning to write the alphabet and keeps re-writing it until she knows it. We are told:

1. She **writes it in full twice**.
2. Then she writes **half of it once**.
3. Then she **rewrites everything she has already written**.

We need to find out how many **letters** she has written in total.

---

### Step 1: Understand the alphabet

The English alphabet has **26 letters**.

---

### Step 2: First part — writing the alphabet twice

- She writes the full alphabet **twice**.
- That’s **2 × 26 = 52 letters**.

---

### Step 3: Second part — writing half of it once

- Half of the alphabet is **13 letters**.
- She writes this **once**.
- That’s **13 letters**.

---

### Step 4: Third part — rewriting everything she has already written

- So far, she has written:
  - 52 (from first two parts)
  - + 13 = **65 letters**
- Now she **rewrites everything she has already written**, which is **65 letters**.

---

### Step 5: Add them all up

- First two parts: 52
- Third part: 13
- Final rewrite: 65

So total letters written =  
**52 + 13 + 65 = 130**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Elise has written a total of 130 letters.**
We are told that Ali is using a **phone tree** to notify families and relatives of a deceased coworker. The process works like this:

- **Round 1**: Ali calls **3 families**.
- **Round 2**: Each of those 3 families calls **3 more families**.
- **Round 3**: Each of those 9 families calls **3 more families**.
- **Round 4**: Each of those 27 families calls **3 more families**.

We are asked: **How many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls?**

---

### Step-by-step breakdown:

Let’s define the number of families notified in each round:

- **Round 1**: Ali calls 3 families.  
  → **3 families notified**

- **Round 2**: Each of the 3 families calls 3 others.  
  → $ 3 \times 3 = 9 $ families notified

- **Round 3**: Each of the 9 families calls 3 others.  
  → $ 9 \times 3 = 27 $ families notified

- **Round 4**: Each of the 27 families calls 3 others.  
  → $ 27 \times 3 = 81 $ families notified

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{81}
$$

So, **81 families** will be notified during the **fourth round** of calls.
Let's solve this step by step.

We are told:

- Mark was **unwell for 3 months**.
- He **lost 10 pounds per month**.
- His **final weight was 70 pounds**.
- We need to find his **initial weight**.

---

### Step 1: Total weight lost
He lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months:

$$
\text{Total weight lost} = 10 \, \text{pounds/month} \times 3 \, \text{months} = 30 \, \text{pounds}
$$

---

### Step 2: Initial weight
If he ended up at 70 pounds after losing 30 pounds, then his initial weight was:

$$
\text{Initial weight} = \text{Final weight} + \text{Weight lost} = 70 + 30 = 100 \, \text{pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**100 pounds**
We are told:

- James's play set has **80 toys**.
- Jonathan needs **2 more toys than he already has** to make a sorted play set that is **five times larger** than James's.
- We are to find how many **toys Jonathan currently has**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the target number of toys

James's play set has **80 toys**.

A play set **five times larger** would have:

$$
5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
$$

So, Jonathan needs **400 toys** in total to make a play set five times larger than James's.

---

### Step 2: Let $ x $ be the number of toys Jonathan **currently has**

He needs **2 more toys than he already has**, so the total number of toys he will have is:

$$
x + (x + 2) = 2x + 2
$$

This must equal the 400 toys needed:

$$
2x + 2 = 400
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve the equation

$$
2x + 2 = 400 \\
2x = 398 \\
x = 199
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Jonathan currently has **199 toys**.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Daniel has to spend.

---

### **Step 1: Find the cost of each item Daniel wants to buy**

- **Notebook:** $1.50 each  
- **Pen:** $0.25 each  
- **Calculator:** $12 each  
- **Geometry set:** $10 each

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the total cost before discount**

Daniel buys:

- **5 notebooks:**  
  $ 5 \times 1.50 = 7.50 $

- **2 pens:**  
  $ 2 \times 0.25 = 0.50 $

- **1 calculator:**  
  $ 1 \times 12 = 12 $

- **1 geometry set:**  
  $ 1 \times 10 = 10 $

Now, add them up:

$$
7.50 + 0.50 + 12 + 10 = 30.00
$$

So, the **total before discount** is **$30.00**.

---

### **Step 3: Apply the 10% discount**

A 10% discount means Daniel pays 90% of the original price.

$$
\text{Discounted total} = 30.00 \times (1 - 0.10) = 30.00 \times 0.90 = 27.00
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**

Daniel has to spend **$27.00** on all the items he wants to buy.
Let's calculate the total cost of Carly's order step by step.

---

### 1. **Hamburgers**  
- 5 hamburgers at $4 each:  
  $ 5 \times 4 = 20 $ dollars

---

### 2. **Potato Fries**  
- 10 packs at $0.30 each:  
  $ 10 \times 0.30 = 3 $ dollars

---

### 3. **Fruit Drinks**  
- 5 cans at $2 each:  
  $ 5 \times 2 = 10 $ dollars

---

### 4. **Total Cost**  
Add up all the costs:  
$ 20 + 3 + 10 = 33 $ dollars

---

### 5. **Change from a $50 Bill**  
Carly gives a $50 bill, so the change is:  
$ 50 - 33 = 17 $ dollars

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$17**
We are given that Antonella sold goods worth **$2500**, and the commission structure is as follows:

- **If you sell goods worth $1000**, you earn a **30% commission**.
- **Sales over $1000 get you an additional 10% commission**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the commission tiers

- For the first **$1000** of sales, the commission rate is **30%**.
- For any sales **above $1000**, the commission rate increases to **10%**.

So, we need to calculate the commission on:
- The first **$1000** at 30%
- The remaining **$1500** (since $2500 - $1000 = $1500) at 10%

---

### Step 2: Calculate the commission for each tier

#### First $1000 at 30%:
$$
0.30 \times 1000 = 300
$$

#### Remaining $1500 at 10%:
$$
0.10 \times 1500 = 150
$$

---

### Step 3: Add both amounts together

$$
300 + 150 = 450
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Antonella earned **$450**.
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the number of water bottles Bill already has**

He has **2 cases**, and each case contains **24 bottles**.

$$
2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles per case} = 48 \text{ bottles}
$$

So, Bill starts with **48 bottles**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how many bottles he needs for the guests**

He has **70 guests**, and he wants **2 bottles per guest**.

$$
70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles per guest} = 140 \text{ bottles needed}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find out how many more bottles he needs to buy**

He already has **48 bottles**, but he needs **140 bottles**.

$$
140 \text{ needed} - 48 \text{ already has} = 92 \text{ additional bottles needed}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Bill needs to buy 92 additional bottles.**
We are given:

- On a **cold day**, Ray swims **1 mile in 16 minutes**.
- On a **warm (hot) day**, he swims **1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long** as on a cold day.
- We need to find how much **longer** it takes Ray to swim **3 miles** on a hot day compared to a cold day.

---

### Step 1: Find the time per mile on a warm day

On a cold day, Ray swims 1 mile in **16 minutes**.

On a warm day, he swims 1 mile in:

$$
2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes}
$$

So, on a warm day, he swims **1 mile in 34 minutes**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate total time for 3 miles on both days

- **Cold day**:  
  $$
  3 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes/mile} = 48 \text{ minutes}
  $$

- **Warm day**:  
  $$
  3 \text{ miles} \times 34 \text{ minutes/mile} = 102 \text{ minutes}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Find the difference in time

$$
102 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 54 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate John's daily earnings
John earns **$2 per hour** and works **5 hours a day**.

$$
\text{Daily earnings} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
$$

### Step 2: Calculate his weekly earnings
He works **4 days a week**.

$$
\text{Weekly earnings} = 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ dollars}
$$

### Step 3: Determine how many weeks to save $80
He wants to save **$80**. Since he saves **$40 per week**, we divide:

$$
\text{Number of weeks} = \frac{80}{40} = 2
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
It will take John **2 weeks** to save $80.
Let's break this down step by step.

We are told:

- You pay **$40** for a **foot-long fish sub**.
- You pay **thrice as much** for a **six-inch cold-cut combo sub**.

### Step 1: Find the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.

"Thrice as much" means **three times** the cost of the foot-long fish sub.

So:

$$
\text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo sub} = 3 \times 40 = 120
$$

### Step 2: Find the total cost for both subs.

$$
\text{Total cost} = 40 + 120 = 160
$$

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{160}
$$

So, the total cost for lunch today at Subway is **$160**.
We are given:

- A bag of **21 buttons**.
- **7 buttons** have **2 holes** each.
- The **rest** of the buttons have **4 holes** each.

---

### Step 1: Find how many buttons have 4 holes

Total buttons = 21  
Buttons with 2 holes = 7  
So, buttons with 4 holes =  
$$
21 - 7 = 14
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate total number of holes

- Buttons with 2 holes:  
$$
7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes} = 14 \text{ holes}
$$

- Buttons with 4 holes:  
$$
14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes} = 56 \text{ holes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add them together

$$
14 + 56 = \boxed{70}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **70 holes** in all the buttons.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Timothy's locker  
We are told that **Timothy's locker is 24 cubic inches**.

$$
\text{Timothy's locker} = 24 \text{ in}^3
$$

---

### Step 2: Zack's locker  
Zack's locker is **half as big** as Timothy's.

$$
\text{Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12 \text{ in}^3
$$

---

### Step 3: Peter's locker  
Peter's locker is **1/4 as big** as Zack's.

$$
\text{Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ in}^3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{3} \text{ cubic inches}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the daily recommended cups of coffee

We are told that **Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee**.

Let’s call the **daily recommended amount** of coffee = **R cups**.

Then, **Octavia drinks**:  
$$
\frac{1}{2}R \text{ cups}
$$

---

### Step 2: How much does Juan drink?

We are told that **Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks**.

So, **Juan drinks**:
$$
10 \times \frac{1}{2}R = 5R \text{ cups}
$$

---

### Step 3: What is the new target for Juan?

The doctor has asked Juan to **reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups**.

So, **Juan must now drink only 4 cups per day**.

---

### Step 4: How many cups must Juan reduce?

Currently, he drinks **5R cups**, and he needs to reduce to **4 cups**.

So, the **reduction** is:
$$
5R - 4 \text{ cups}
$$

But we need a numerical answer. So let's find the value of **R**.

---

### Step 5: Find R (the daily recommended amount)

We are told that **Octavia drinks half the daily recommended amount**, and we don't have her exact number, but we can use the final information to solve for R.

We know that **Juan must reduce from 5R to 4 cups**.

So, the **reduction** is:
$$
5R - 4
$$

But we are not given any other numbers, so we need to **assume** or **find R** using the fact that the **daily recommended amount is 4 cups** after reduction.

Wait — actually, the **daily recommended amount is 4 cups**, which is what **Juan must now drink**.

So, that means:

$$
\text{Daily recommended amount} = 4 \text{ cups}
$$

Therefore, **R = 4 cups**

---

### Step 6: Plug in R = 4 into the reduction formula

Now that we know R = 4:

- **Juan currently drinks**:  
  $$
  5R = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cups}
  $$

- **He must now drink**:  
  $$
  4 \text{ cups}
  $$

So, the **reduction** is:
$$
20 - 4 = \boxed{16} \text{ cups}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem

- The pet shop has **6 cages**.
- **3 of the cages** have **10 hamsters** each.
- The **other 3 cages** have **5 guinea pigs** each.
- We are asked to find the **total number of rodents** in the shop.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of hamsters

Each of the 3 cages has 10 hamsters:

$$
3 \text{ cages} \times 10 \text{ hamsters per cage} = 30 \text{ hamsters}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the number of guinea pigs

Each of the other 3 cages has 5 guinea pigs:

$$
3 \text{ cages} \times 5 \text{ guinea pigs per cage} = 15 \text{ guinea pigs}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add them together

$$
30 \text{ hamsters} + 15 \text{ guinea pigs} = 45 \text{ rodents}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{45}
$$

The pet shop has **45 rodents** in total.
Let's break this down step by step to find the **average weight** of Mark, Susan, and Bob.

---

### Step 1: Find Susan's weight

We're told:

- **Mark weighs 150 pounds**
- **Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark**

So:

$$
\text{Susan's weight} = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find Bob's weight

We're told:

- **Bob weighs twice as much as Susan**

So:

$$
\text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the total weight of the three friends

$$
\text{Total weight} = \text{Mark} + \text{Susan} + \text{Bob} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find the average weight

$$
\text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**The average weight of the three friends is 180 pounds.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- The **pyramid** is at an angle of **32 degrees** from the ground.
- The **sun moves upward** at a rate of **5 degrees per hour**.
- The **sun starts at the tip of the pyramid** and moves for **10 hours**.

We are to find:  
> How many degrees will there be **from the ground to the sun** after 10 hours?

---

### **Step 1: Understand the starting position**

The pyramid is at an angle of **32 degrees** from the ground. That means if you look at the pyramid from the entrance, the top of the pyramid is **32 degrees above the horizontal** (the ground).

So, initially, the **angle between the ground and the sun** is **32 degrees**.

---

### **Step 2: Sun's movement**

The sun is moving **upward** at **5 degrees per hour**, starting from the **tip of the pyramid**.

This means that the **angle of the sun with respect to the ground increases** over time.

After **10 hours**, the sun will have moved:

$$
\text{Angle moved} = 5^\circ/\text{hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total angle from the ground to the sun**

Since the sun starts at the **tip of the pyramid**, which is already **32 degrees above the ground**, and then moves **50 degrees higher**, the total angle from the ground to the sun is:

$$
\text{Total angle} = 32^\circ + 50^\circ = \boxed{82^\circ}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{82^\circ}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the ages of the sons

- One son is **12 years old**.
- The other is **4 years younger**, so:

$$
12 - 4 = 8 \text{ years old}
$$

So, the two sons are **12 and 8 years old**.

---

### Step 2: Find out how many candles James needs to buy

James is buying **candles for each of his sons**, so he needs **one candle per son**.

$$
12 + 8 = 20 \text{ candles}
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine how many packs of candles James needs to buy

A pack contains **5 candles**, and each pack costs **$3**.

To find out how many packs are needed:

$$
\frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ packs}
$$

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost

Each pack costs $3, and he buys 4 packs:

$$
4 \times 3 = 12
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{12}
$$

James spends **$12** on candles.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many pages Judy read in **two weeks**.

---

### **Week 1:**
- She read **15 minutes each night**.
- Let’s assume she read **7 nights a week** (since there are 7 days in a week).
- So, total reading time in Week 1 =  
  $$
  15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes}
  $$

We are not given her reading rate for Week 1, so we'll need to use the **given reading rate** from Week 2 to calculate how many pages she read in Week 1.

---

### **Week 2:**
- She read a **total of 100 pages**.
- Her reading rate is **2 pages per 1.5 minutes**.

First, let's find out how many **minutes** it takes to read 1 page:

$$
\frac{1.5 \text{ minutes}}{2 \text{ pages}} = 0.75 \text{ minutes per page}
$$

Now, find out how many **pages** she read in 105 minutes (from Week 1):

$$
\frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{0.75 \text{ minutes/page}} = 140 \text{ pages}
$$

So, Judy read **140 pages** in Week 1.

---

We are given:

- Shiloh is **44 years old today**.
- In **7 years**, Shiloh will be **three times as old as his nephew**.

Let’s define:

- Let $ x $ be the **current age** of Shiloh's nephew.

### Step 1: Express ages in 7 years

- Shiloh's age in 7 years:  
  $ 44 + 7 = 51 $

- Nephew's age in 7 years:  
  $ x + 7 $

### Step 2: Use the relationship given

In 7 years, Shiloh will be **three times as old as his nephew**:

$$
51 = 3(x + 7)
$$

### Step 3: Solve the equation

$$
51 = 3(x + 7) \\
51 = 3x + 21 \\
51 - 21 = 3x \\
30 = 3x \\
x = 10
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:

The nephew is **10 years old today**.
We are told how much the tooth fairy gave Sharon for each tooth she lost, depending on which tooth it was:

1. **First tooth**: $5.00  
2. **Next three teeth (tooth 2, 3, 4)**: $1.00 each  
3. **Last two teeth (tooth 5, 6)**: Half of the amount for the previous three teeth → $0.50 each

Let’s calculate the total amount step by step.

---

### Step 1: First tooth
- Amount = $5.00

---

### Step 2: Next three teeth (tooth 2, 3, 4)
- Each gives $1.00
- Total for these 3 teeth = 3 × $1.00 = **$3.00**

---

### Step 3: Last two teeth (tooth 5, 6)
- Each gives half of $1.00 = $0.50
- Total for these 2 teeth = 2 × $0.50 = **$1.00**

---

### Step 4: Add all amounts together

$$
\text{Total} = \$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.00 = \boxed{\$9.00}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **\$9.00**
We are given the following information:

- Richie scored **80 goals**.
- Richie scored **20 more goals than Mark**.
- Richie scored **45 more goals than Anna**.

We need to find the total number of goals scored by **Richie, Mark, and Anna**.

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ R $ = number of goals scored by **Richie**
- $ M $ = number of goals scored by **Mark**
- $ A $ = number of goals scored by **Anna**

We are told:
- $ R = 80 $
- $ R = M + 20 $ → So, $ M = R - 20 = 80 - 20 = 60 $
- $ R = A + 45 $ → So, $ A = R - 45 = 80 - 45 = 35 $

---

### Step 2: Add up all the goals

$$
\text{Total goals} = R + M + A = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{175}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand what Liam made
- **Liam made $63** total one weekend.

---

### Step 2: Understand what Mitchell did
- Mitchell sold **21 lemonades**.
- Each lemonade was sold for **$4**.

So, Mitchell's total earnings are:

$$
21 \text{ lemonades} \times 4 \text{ dollars per lemonade} = 84 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the difference in their earnings
- Mitchell made **$84**
- Liam made **$63**

So, the difference is:

$$
84 - 63 = 21 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Mitchell made $21 more than Liam.**
We are told that Peter has **$70** and wants to **spend an equal amount each day for one week (7 days)**.

### Step 1: Determine how much he spends each day
$$
\frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
$$

So, Peter spends **$10 each day** for the week.

---

### Step 2: Break down the spending by day

- **Sunday through Wednesday (5 days)**: He buys **wooden action figures** at **$5 each**.
- **Thursday through Saturday (2 days)**: He buys **plastic action figures** at **$2 each**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate how many wooden action figures he can buy

He spends $10 per day for 5 days:
$$
5 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ dollars/day} = 50 \text{ dollars}
$$

Each wooden action figure costs $5, so:
$$
\frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ wooden action figures}
$$

---

### Step 4: Calculate how many plastic action figures he can buy

He spends $10 per day for 2 days:
$$
2 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ dollars/day} = 20 \text{ dollars}
$$

Each plastic action figure costs $2, so:
$$
\frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ plastic action figures}
$$

---

### Step 5: Total number of action figures

$$
10 \text{ wooden} + 10 \text{ plastic} = \boxed{20} \text{ action figures}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **20 action figures**.
Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Spaying the kitten**:  
   Cost = $200

2. **3 vaccines**:  
   Each vaccine costs $20, so:  
   $ 3 \times 20 = 60 $

3. **Broken vases**:  
   The kitten broke 4 vases, each costing $12, so:  
   $ 4 \times 12 = 48 $

Now, add all these amounts together:

- Spaying: $200  
- Vaccines: $60  
- Broken vases: $48  

**Total cost so far** = $200 + $60 + $48 = **$308**

### ✅ Final Answer: **$308**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many roses Ford grows per week.
Ford grows **40 roses every week**.

### Step 2: Determine how many roses the flower shops order per week.
- First shop: **20 roses**
- Second shop: **15 roses**
- Third shop: **30 roses**

Total roses ordered per week =  
$$
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses}
$$

### Step 3: Compare with what Ford grows per week.
Ford grows **40 roses per week**, but the shops order **65 roses per week**.

So, Ford is short by:
$$
65 - 40 = 25 \text{ roses per week}
$$

### Step 4: Calculate how many roses he lacks in a month (assuming 4 weeks in a month).
$$
25 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 100 \text{ roses}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the problem**

- Katina starts with **$3000** in her savings account.
- She removes **$100** from the account **every month**.
- We are asked to find out how much money will be left **after 2 years**.

---

### **Step 2: Convert years to months**

Since there are **12 months in a year**, then:

$$
2 \text{ years} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total amount removed in 24 months**

She removes $100 per month, so over 24 months:

$$
24 \times 100 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Subtract the total removed from the initial amount**

Initial amount = $3000  
Total removed = $2400

$$
3000 - 2400 = 600
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{600}
$$

So, after 2 years, **$600** will remain in Katina's savings account.
Let's break this down step by step to find the **net profit**.

---

### **Step 1: Cost of ingredients per 10 sandwiches**

- **Bread:** $3.00 per loaf, and each loaf makes **10 sandwiches**, so:
  - Cost of bread for 10 sandwiches = **$3.00**

- **Cheese and condiments:** $30.00 per 10 sandwiches.

So, **total cost per 10 sandwiches** is:

$$
\$3.00 \text{ (bread)} + \$30.00 \text{ (cheese/condiments)} = \$33.00
$$

---

### **Step 2: Revenue from selling 10 sandwiches**

- Each sandwich is sold for **$7.00**, so:

$$
10 \text{ sandwiches} \times \$7.00 = \$70.00
$$

---

### **Step 3: Net profit per 10 sandwiches**

$$
\text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = \$70.00 - \$33.00 = \$37.00
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$37.00}
$$

That’s the **net profit per 10 sandwiches**.
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Total number of crayons**
- Kate has **3 boxes** of crayons.
- Each box has **64 crayons**.

$$
\text{Total crayons} = 3 \times 64 = 192 \text{ crayons}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Crayons used for muffins**
- The problem says the crayons are **worn down to small pieces**, and she uses **8 small pieces** of crayons to make **1 muffin**.
- So, **each muffin requires 8 small pieces**.

$$
\text{Number of muffins} = \frac{\text{Total crayon pieces}}{8} = \frac{192}{8} = 24 \text{ muffins}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Money earned per muffin**
- She sells each muffin for **$1.50**.

$$
\text{Total money} = 24 \times 1.50 = 36 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{36}
$$

Kate can make **$36** from selling the muffin crayons.
Let's break this down step by step to calculate the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet in his bedroom.

---

### **Step 1: Find the area of the bedroom**

The bedroom measures:

- **Length = 18 feet**
- **Width = 12 feet**

So, the **area** is:

$$
\text{Area} = 18 \times 12 = 216 \text{ square feet}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the cost of the new carpet and padding**

- **Cost per square foot of new carpet**: $12
- **Cost per square foot of padding**: $2

So, the **total cost for carpet and padding** is:

$$
(12 + 2) \times 216 = 14 \times 216 = 3024 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the cost to remove the old carpet**

- **Cost to remove old carpet**: $4 per square foot

$$
4 \times 216 = 864 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add up all the costs**

- Cost of new carpet and padding: $3024
- Cost to remove old carpet: $864

$$
\text{Total cost} = 3024 + 864 = 3888 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{3888}
$$

It will cost Michael **$3,888** to replace the carpet in his bedroom.
Let's break this down step by step to find the **average number of birds Mack saw per day** over the 7 days.

---

### Step 1: List the number of birds seen each day

We are told:

- **Day 1 and Day 2**: Total = 50 birds  
- **Day 3**: 0 birds  
- **Day 4 and Day 5**: Total = 120 birds  
- **Day 6**: 20 birds  
- **Day 7**: 90 birds

So, we can write the total number of birds seen each day as:

- Day 1: ?  
- Day 2: ?  
- Day 3: 0  
- Day 4: ?  
- Day 5: ?  
- Day 6: 20  
- Day 7: 90  

But since we're given totals for Day 1 + Day 2 = 50, and Day 4 + Day 5 = 120, we can use that directly.

---

### Step 2: Add up all the birds seen over the 7 days

Let’s sum them up:

- Days 1 + 2: 50 birds  
- Day 3: 0 birds  
- Days 4 + 5: 120 birds  
- Day 6: 20 birds  
- Day 7: 90 birds  

Now add these together:

$$
50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 \text{ birds}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the average

There are **7 days**, so the average is:

$$
\frac{280}{7} = 40
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**On average, Mack saw 40 birds per day.**
We are given a number train with a **starting value of 20**. The operations are as follows:

1. **Start with the starting value: 20**
2. **Add half the number**:  
   $ \text{Half of 20} = \frac{20}{2} = 10 $  
   So, add that to the starting value:  
   $ 20 + 10 = 30 $
3. **Divide the result by 5**:  
   $ \frac{30}{5} = 6 $
4. **Multiply this result by (starting value - 12)**:  
   $ \text{Starting value} - 12 = 20 - 12 = 8 $  
   Now multiply:  
   $ 6 \times 8 = 48 $

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **48**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

**Step 1:**  
We are told that the boy has **5 cards**.

**Step 2:**  
His brother has **3 fewer cards** than the boy.  
So, the brother has:  
$$
5 - 3 = 2 \text{ cards}
$$

**Step 3:**  
Now, to find out how many cards they have **together**, we add the number of cards the boy has and the number of cards the brother has:  
$$
5 + 2 = 7
$$

---

**Final Answer:**  
They have **7 cards together**. ✅
We are told that Maggie's oven is **malfunctioning**, and when she sets it to **450°F**, the actual temperature is **468°F**. We are also told that the **error is consistent (same percentage)** for any setting.

We are asked: **If her recipe calls for 520°F, what temperature should she set the oven at?**

---

### Step 1: Find the percentage error

The oven is set to **450°F**, but the actual temperature is **468°F**.

So the **error** is:

$$
\text{Error} = 468 - 450 = 18
$$

Now find the **percentage error** relative to the **set temperature** (450°F):

$$
\text{Percentage Error} = \left( \frac{18}{450} \right) \times 100 = 4\%
$$

So the oven is **overheating by 4%**.

---

### Step 2: Apply the same percentage error to the new temperature

Her recipe calls for **520°F**, but the oven will be **overheating by 4%** again.

So the **actual temperature** will be:

$$
\text{Actual Temperature} = 520 + (0.04 \times 520) = 520 + 20.8 = 540.8
$$

But wait — we need to be careful here. The question says:

> "If it's off by the same percentage for any recipe, what temperature should she set it at if her recipe calls for 520 degrees?"

This means that the **oven is over heating by 4%**, so the **actual temperature is higher than the set temperature**.

So, to get the correct **set temperature** that will result in an **actual temperature of 520°F**, we need to **reverse the 4% overheat**.

Let’s define:

- Let $ x $ be the **set temperature**.
- The oven **overheats by 4%**, so the **actual temperature** is:

$$
x + 0.04x = 1.04x
$$

We want this actual temperature to be **520°F**:

$$
1.04x = 520
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
x = \frac{520}{1.04} = 500
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Maggie should set the oven to **500°F** to get the actual temperature of **520°F**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Convert the first movie's duration to minutes  
The first movie is **1 hour and 30 minutes long**.  
- 1 hour = 60 minutes  
- So, 1 hour and 30 minutes = **60 + 30 = 90 minutes**

---

### Step 2: Convert the second movie's duration to minutes  
The second movie is **2 hours and 5 minutes long**.  
- 2 hours = 120 minutes  
- So, 2 hours and 5 minutes = **120 + 5 = 125 minutes**

---

### Step 3: Add both durations together  
- First movie: 90 minutes  
- Second movie: 125 minutes  
- Total time = **90 + 125 = 215 minutes**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
It will take Max **215 minutes** to watch the two movies.
We are given the following:

- Herb paid **$76,000** for his house.
- Juan's house is **30% less expensive** than Herb's.

### Step 1: Find the price of Juan's house

Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, that means it costs **70% of Herb's house price**.

$$
\text{Price of Juan's house} = 70\% \times 76,000 = 0.70 \times 76,000
$$

$$
= 53,200
$$

So, **Juan's house is worth $53,200**.

---

### Step 2: Add the values of both houses

$$
\text{Total value} = \text{Herb's house} + \text{Juan's house} = 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{129,200}
$$

The combined value of the two houses is **$129,200**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many cups and dishes Judy brought

- Judy bought **a dozen cups** → that’s **12 cups**.
- She bought **twice as many dishes as cups** → so:

$$
\text{Dishes} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ dishes}
$$

So, **Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes**.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many cups and dishes her friend brought

- Friend brought **40 cups**.
- Friend brought **20 more dishes than Judy** → Judy had 24 dishes, so:

$$
\text{Friend's dishes} = 24 + 20 = 44 \text{ dishes}
$$

So, **Friend brought 40 cups and 44 dishes**.

---

### Step 3: Add up all the utensils (cups + dishes) brought by both Judy and her friend

- **Judy**: 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils  
- **Friend**: 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils

$$
\text{Total utensils} = 36 + 84 = 120
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{120}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the contact usage
- **Each box has 90 single-use contacts.**
- These last **Pete 45 days**.
- So, Pete uses **2 contacts per day** (because 90 contacts ÷ 45 days = 2 contacts/day).

### Step 2: Determine how many contacts Pete needs
- We are not told how many days Pete will use the contacts for, but the question is about **how much each pair of contacts costs**, assuming he buys **2 boxes**.

So we can assume that he is buying **2 boxes** to get enough contacts for his usage.

### Step 3: Total number of contacts in 2 boxes
- Each box has 90 contacts → 2 boxes have **180 contacts**.

### Step 4: Cost of 2 boxes
- Each box is **$100.00**, and there is a **10% discount**.
- So the discounted price per box is:
  $$
  100 \times (1 - 0.10) = 100 \times 0.90 = 90
  $$
- For 2 boxes:
  $$
  2 \times 90 = 180
  $$

### Step 5: Cost per pair of contacts
- He gets **180 contacts** for **$180**.
- So the cost per contact is:
  $$
  \frac{180}{180} = 1
  $$
- Since each pair is **2 contacts**, the cost per pair is:
  $$
  1 \times 2 = 2
  $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Each pair of contacts costs $2.00.**
We are told that **Tabitha pays $10 per hour** for help cleaning. We need to find how much **more money John earned compared to Jill**.

---

### Step 1: Determine how long Jill worked

- **Jill worked:**  
  - 2 hours on **Saturday**  
  - 1 hour on **Sunday**  
  - Total = 2 + 1 = **3 hours**

- **Jill's earnings:**  
  $ 3 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$30 $

---

### Step 2: Determine how long John worked

- **John worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday:**  
  Jill worked 2 hours on Saturday → John worked $ 2 \times 2 = 4 $ hours on Saturday

- **John worked three times as long as Jill on Sunday:**  
  Jill worked 1 hour on Sunday → John worked $ 3 \times 1 = 3 $ hours on Sunday

- **Total time John worked:**  
  4 (Saturday) + 3 (Sunday) = **7 hours**

- **John's earnings:**  
  $ 7 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$70 $

---

### Step 3: Find the difference in earnings

- **John earned:** \$70  
- **Jill earned:** \$30  
- **Difference:**  
  $ 70 - 30 = \boxed{\$40} $

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**John earned \$40 more than Jill.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate total calories burned**

- **Aerobics:**  
  She does aerobics for **2 hours**, and it burns **500 calories/hour**.  
  $$
  2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories}
  $$

- **Running:**  
  She runs for **1 hour**, and it burns **600 calories/hour**.  
  $$
  1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories}
  $$

- **Total calories burned:**  
  $$
  1000 + 600 = 1600 \text{ calories}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how much water she needs to drink**

She needs to drink **100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned**.

So, per calorie:
$$
\frac{100 \text{ ml}}{200 \text{ calories}} = 0.5 \text{ ml per calorie}
$$

Now multiply that by the total calories burned:
$$
1600 \text{ calories} \times 0.5 \text{ ml/calorie} = 800 \text{ ml}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{800} \text{ ml}
$$
We are told:

- The jar contains **red**, **blue**, and **green** jelly beans.
- The total number of jelly beans is **4500**.
- There is a **note** that says:
  - "This jar contains **1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans**."
  - "This jar contains **1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans**."

We are to find:  
**How many more green jelly beans are there than red jelly beans?**

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ B $ = number of **blue** jelly beans
- $ R $ = number of **red** jelly beans
- $ G $ = number of **green** jelly beans

From the note:

- $ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B $
- $ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B $

---

### Step 2: Use the total number of jelly beans

$$
R + B + G = 4500
$$

Substitute the expressions for $ R $ and $ G $:

$$
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
$$

$$
(0.99 + 1 + 1.01)B = 4500
$$

$$
3B = 4500
$$

$$
B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
$$

---

### Step 3: Find $ R $ and $ G $

$$
R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485
$$
$$
G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515
$$

---

### Step 4: Find how many more green jelly beans than red

$$
G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{30}
$$

There are **30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the three typing speeds
Jared has taken three typing tests:

1. First test: **47 WPM**
2. Second test: **52 WPM**
3. Third test: He increases his speed **by 5 words** from the second test.

So, the third test is:
$$
52 + 5 = 57 \text{ WPM}
$$

### Step 2: Find the average of the three measurements
To find the average, add all three speeds and divide by 3:

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{47 + 52 + 57}{3}
$$

First, add the numbers:

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- **If Martin eats Cheerios every day for breakfast**, he **loses 1.25 pounds per week**.
- **If he eats donuts every day for breakfast**, he **gains 1.75 pounds per week**.
- We are to find the **difference in his weight at the end of 5 weeks** between the two options.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total weight change over 5 weeks for each option**

#### **Option 1: Eating Cheerios (lose weight)**

- Weight loss per week = **1.25 pounds**
- Over 5 weeks =  
  $$
  1.25 \times 5 = 6.25 \text{ pounds}
  $$

#### **Option 2: Eating Donuts (gain weight)**

- Weight gain per week = **1.75 pounds**
- Over 5 weeks =  
  $$
  1.75 \times 5 = 8.75 \text{ pounds}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Find the difference in weight between the two options**

$$
\text{Difference} = 8.75 - 6.25 = 2.5 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{2.5 \text{ pounds}}
$$

Martin would weigh **2.5 pounds more** if he eats donuts every day for 5 weeks compared to eating Cheerios every day.
Let's break down the problem step by step to figure out how many **seats Alex will need**.

---

### Step 1: People invited via email

- Alex invites **100 people** via email.
- Each of those 100 people says they will invite **2 friends**.

So, from the 100 people:
- Total number of friends invited = $100 \times 2 = 200$

So far, we have:
- 100 (original invites) + 200 (friends invited) = **300 people**

---

### Step 2: Friends called by Alex

- Alex calls **10 friends** to invite them too.
- These 10 friends say they will bring their **spouses**.

Assuming each person brings **1 spouse**, that’s:
- 10 spouses = 10 more people

So now we add:
- 10 (called friends) + 10 (spouses) = **20 more people**

Now total people so far:
- 300 (from email and friends) + 20 (called friends and spouses) = **320 people**

---

### Final Count:

So, Alex needs to make sure there are enough seats for **320 people**.

---

### ✅ Answer: **320 seats**.
We are given the weights of four dogs in a line, and we need to find the **weight of the Mastiff**.

Let’s break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Assign variables and known values

- **Affenpinscher** (first dog):  
  Weight = **10 pounds**

- **Dachshund** (second dog):  
  Weight = **twice** the Affenpinscher  
  → $ 2 \times 10 = 20 $ pounds

- **Papillon** (third dog):  
  Weight = **one-fourth** the Dachshund  
  → $ \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 $ pounds

- **Mastiff** (fourth dog):  
  Weight = **44 times** the Papillon  
  → $ 44 \times 5 = 220 $ pounds

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{220}
$$

So, the **Mastiff weighed 220 pounds**.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much more expensive the boots are on **eBay** compared to **Amazon**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost on Amazon

- **Price of boots**: $16  
- **Shipping cost**: $4  

**Total cost on Amazon** = $16 + $4 = **$20**

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost on eBay

- **Price of boots**: $13  
- **Shipping cost**: Twice as much as Amazon → $4 × 2 = **$8**

**Total cost on eBay** = $13 + $8 = **$21**

---

### Step 3: Find the difference in total cost

- **Cost on eBay**: $21  
- **Cost on Amazon**: $20  

**Difference** = $21 - $20 = **$1**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

The boots work out to be **$1 more expensive** on eBay.
We are given:

- The beanstalk starts at **4 feet**.
- It **doubles in height every day**.
- Mark's window is **20 feet** above the ground.

We need to find out how many days it will take for the beanstalk to be **taller than 20 feet**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the growth pattern

The height of the beanstalk on day $ n $ is:

$$
\text{Height on day } n = 4 \times 2^n
$$

Because it doubles every day, starting from 4 feet.

---

### Step 2: Find when the height exceeds 20 feet

We want to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that:

$$
4 \times 2^n > 20
$$

Divide both sides by 4:

$$
2^n > 5
$$

Now solve for $ n $:

Try small values of $ n $:

- $ n = 0 $: $ 2^0 = 1 $ → not greater than 5
- $ n = 1 $: $ 2^1 = 2 $ → not greater than 5
- $ n = 2 $: $ 2^2 = 4 $ → not greater than 5
- $ n = 3 $: $ 2^3 = 8 $ → **greater than 5**

So, $ n = 3 $ is the first time the height is greater than 5, which means the beanstalk is taller than 20 feet.

---

### Step 3: Confirm the height on day 3

$$
\text{Height on day 3} = 4 \times 2^3 = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ feet}
$$

That’s more than 20 feet.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

It will take **3 days** for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find the protein per gram of mushrooms**

We are told:

- A **cup of mushrooms** weighs **100 grams**.
- That same cup contains **3 grams of protein**.

So, the **protein per gram** is:

$$
\frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the daily protein intake**

John eats **200 grams of mushrooms every day**.

So, the **daily protein intake** is:

$$
200 \text{ grams} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the weekly protein intake**

There are **7 days in a week**, so:

$$
6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**John gets 42 grams of protein per week.**
We are told:

> **Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. How old will Jerry be in 3 years?**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define the variable

Let $ x $ be Jerry's **current age**.

---

### Step 2: Translate the statement into an equation

"Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago."

So, 5 years ago, Jerry was $ x - 5 $ years old.

According to the problem:
$$
x = 2(x - 5)
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve the equation

$$
x = 2(x - 5) \\
x = 2x - 10 \\
x - 2x = -10 \\
-x = -10 \\
x = 10
$$

So, **Jerry is currently 10 years old**.

---

### Step 4: Find how old he will be in 3 years

$$
10 + 3 = 13
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the dental work**

- **2 implants**, each costing **$2000**  
  → $ 2 \times 2000 = \$4000 $

- **One implant has a porcelain crown**, which costs an extra **$500**  
  → So, one implant is **$2000 + $500 = $2500**

- The other implant is just **$2000**

So, total cost:
$$
2500 + 2000 = \$4500
$$

---

### **Step 2: Subtract the deposit he’s already made**

He has already put down a **deposit of $600**

So, remaining amount needed:
$$
4500 - 600 = \$3900
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how many hours he needs to work**

He earns **$15 per hour**

To find out how many hours he needs to work to make **$3900**, divide:

$$
\frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
George needs to work **260 hours** before he has enough money to pay for the dental work.
We are given a triangle where:

- The **three angles add up to 180°**.
- One angle is **twice the smallest angle**.
- Another angle is **three times the smallest angle**.

Let’s denote the **smallest angle** as $ x $ degrees.

Then:

- The second angle is $ 2x $
- The third angle is $ 3x $

Now, since the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°, we can write the equation:

$$
x + 2x + 3x = 180
$$

Simplify:

$$
6x = 180
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
x = \frac{180}{6} = 30
$$

So the angles are:

- Smallest angle: $ x = 30^\circ $
- Second angle: $ 2x = 60^\circ $
- Largest angle: $ 3x = 90^\circ $

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{90}
$$

The **largest angle** in the triangle is **90 degrees**.
Let's figure out how many gumballs Colby can buy, given that each gumball costs **a nickel (5 cents)**.

---

### Step 1: Count the total amount of money Colby has

He has:

- **8 quarters** → 8 × 50 = **400 cents**
- **6 dimes** → 6 × 10 = **60 cents**
- **14 nickels** → 14 × 5 = **70 cents**
- **15 pennies** → 15 × 1 = **15 cents**

Now add them all up:

$$
400 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 545 \text{ cents}
$$

---

### Step 2: Divide total cents by cost per gumball

Each gumball costs **5 cents**, so:

$$
\frac{545}{5} = 109
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Colby can buy **109 gumballs**.
Let's calculate the total number of legs for all the pets in the store step by step.

### Step 1: Count the number of each type of pet
- **Dogs**: 5  
- **Cats**: 2  
- **Birds**: 10  

### Step 2: Determine how many legs each type of pet has
- **Dogs**: Each dog has **4 legs**  
- **Cats**: Each cat has **4 legs**  
- **Birds**: Each bird has **2 legs**

### Step 3: Multiply the number of each pet by the number of legs
- **Dogs**: $ 5 \times 4 = 20 $ legs  
- **Cats**: $ 2 \times 4 = 8 $ legs  
- **Birds**: $ 10 \times 2 = 20 $ legs  

### Step 4: Add up all the legs
$$
20 + 8 + 20 = 48
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**48 legs** in total.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial weight**: Jamaal starts with an **8-pound** weight.

2. **Increases by 50%**:
   - A 50% increase means he adds half of 8 pounds to the original 8 pounds.
   - 50% of 8 is:  
     $$
     0.5 \times 8 = 4 \text{ pounds}
     $$
   - So, the new weight is:  
     $$
     8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds}
     $$

3. **Then he uses a weight that is **two pounds lighter** than that:
   - Subtract 2 pounds from 12:  
     $$
     12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds}
     $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **10 pounds**.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out **how many games Steve has after 3 years**.

---

### **Initial Setup:**
- **Birthday gifts:**  
  Steve gets **5 games** for his birthday.
- **Saves up money:**  
  He saves enough to buy **1 game per month** for a year (12 months).
- **Second year:**  
  He starts buying **2 games per month**.
- **Third year:**  
  He buys **4 games per month** due to a part-time job.
- **Christmas gifts:**  
  He gets **5 games every year** on Christmas.

---

### **Step 1: Total games from birthday and Christmas over 3 years**

- Birthday: 5 games (only once)
- Christmas: 5 games/year × 3 years = **15 games**

So, total from birthday + Christmas =  
**5 + 15 = 20 games**

---

### **Step 2: Games bought over the 3 years**

We need to calculate how many games he buys each year:

#### **Year 1:**
- 1 game/month × 12 months = **12 games**

#### **Year 2:**
- 2 games/month × 12 months = **24 games**

#### **Year 3:**
- 4 games/month × 12 months = **48 games**

Total games bought over 3 years =  
**12 + 24 + 48 = 84 games**

---

### **Step 3: Total games after 3 years**

Add the games from birthday/Christmas and the ones he bought:

- From birthday and Christmas: **20 games**
- From saving and buying: **84 games**

**Total = 20 + 84 = 104 games**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 104 games**
We are given that a plane travels **1200 miles in 3 hours**. We need to find how many **additional hours** it would take to travel **an additional 2000 miles**, assuming the same rate.

---

### Step 1: Find the speed of the plane

Speed is calculated as:

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the time to travel 2000 miles at this speed

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Final Answer:

It would take **5 additional hours** to travel the additional 2000 miles.

$$
\boxed{5}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine Ruiz's rate of making chocolates**

Ruiz can make **120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours**.

So, his **rate** is:

$$
\text{Ruiz's rate} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds per hour}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine Marissa's rate**

Marissa makes **3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours**.

First, find how much Ruiz makes in **one hour**:

$$
\text{Ruiz in 1 hour} = 60 \text{ pounds}
$$

Now, Marissa makes **3/4 of that** in one hour:

$$
\text{Marissa's rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 60 = 45 \text{ pounds per hour}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total production in 12 hours**

Both work for **12 hours**.

- Ruiz's total:  
$$
60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
$$

- Marissa's total:  
$$
45 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 540 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add their totals**

$$
\text{Total chocolate made together} = 720 + 540 = \boxed{1260} \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **1260 pounds** of chocolate.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Money spent on Monday  
Howard spends **$8** on Monday.

---

### Step 2: Money spent on Tuesday  
He spends **twice as much** as he did on Monday.  
So, on Tuesday:  
$$
2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Money spent on Wednesday  
He spends **4 times as much** as he did on Tuesday.  
So, on Wednesday:  
$$
4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total money spent  
Add up the amounts spent over the three days:  
$$
8 + 16 + 64 = 88 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 5: Money left  
Howard originally had **$100**.  
After spending $88, he has:  
$$
100 - 88 = 12 \text{ dollars left}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**$12** is left.
We are given Patrick's lemonade sales over 6 hours, and we need to calculate how much money he earned in total.

---

### **Step 1: First 4 hours**

- **Cups sold per hour:** 15 cups/hour  
- **Price per cup:** $0.50  
- **Total cups sold in 4 hours:**  
  $$
  15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups}
  $$

- **Total money earned from first 4 hours:**  
  $$
  60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Next 2 hours**

- **Cups sold per hour:** 10 cups/hour  
- **Price per cup:** $0.60  
- **Total cups sold in 2 hours:**  
  $$
  10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}
  $$

- **Total money earned from next 2 hours:**  
  $$
  20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Total earnings**

$$
\$30 + \$12 = \boxed{\$42}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **Patrick earned \$42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many **years** before the tires need to be replaced.

---

### **Step 1: Find how many rotations per mile**

We're told:

- Every **2 miles**, the tires rotate **725 times**.

So, for **1 mile**, the number of rotations is:

$$
\frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find total rotations per month**

Jeremy drives **400 miles per month**.

So, total rotations per month:

$$
400 \times 362.5 = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find how many months until tire wears out**

Each tire can handle **10,440,000 rotations**.

So, number of months until the tire needs replacement:

$$
\frac{10,440,000}{145,000} = 72 \text{ months}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Convert months to years**

$$
\frac{72}{12} = 6 \text{ years}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{6} \text{ years}
$$

So, the tires will need to be replaced after **6 years**.
We are given the following information:

- A **jumbo bottle of shampoo** costs **$24.00**.
- The **directions say to use 2 pumps of shampoo for 120 washings**.
- **Jackie uses 1 pump per wash**.

We are asked: **How much does each pump cost, in cents?**

---

### Step 1: Find how many washings are possible with the entire bottle

The directions say:
> 2 pumps = 120 washings

So, we can find how many washings per pump:

$$
\frac{120 \text{ washings}}{2 \text{ pumps}} = 60 \text{ washings per pump}
$$

So, **1 pump gives you 60 washings**.

---

### Step 2: Find total number of pumps in the bottle

If 1 pump = 60 washings, then the number of pumps in the bottle is:

$$
\frac{120 \text{ washings}}{60 \text{ washings per pump}} = 2 \text{ pumps}
$$

Wait — that doesn't make sense! Let's go back.

Actually, the **directions say that 2 pumps give you 120 washings**, so the **entire bottle contains enough shampoo for 120 washings** (since that’s what the directions say).

So, the **entire bottle gives you 120 washings**, and **Jackie uses 1 pump per washing**, so:

$$
\text{Number of pumps in the bottle} = 120 \text{ washings} \times 1 \text{ pump per washing} = 120 \text{ pumps}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the cost per pump

The bottle costs **$24.00**, which is **2400 cents**.

There are **120 pumps** in the bottle.

$$
\text{Cost per pump} = \frac{2400 \text{ cents}}{120 \text{ pumps}} = 20 \text{ cents per pump}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{20} \text{ cents per pump}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much money Joe will have left after his purchase.

---

### **Step 1: Original Prices**
- **Shirt**: $25  
- **Shorts**: $35  

**Total original price before discount**:  
$$
25 + 35 = 60 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Apply the 30% Discount**

A 30% discount means Joe pays **70% of the original price** (because 100% - 30% = 70%).

So, we calculate 70% of $60:

$$
0.70 \times 60 = 42 \text{ dollars}
$$

So, after the discount, the total cost is **$42**.

---

### **Step 3: Add Sales Tax**

The problem says **sales tax is included**, which means the $42 already includes any applicable sales tax.

So, the final amount Joe pays is **$42**.

---

### **Step 4: Subtract from Joe’s Budget**

Joe has **$50** to spend.

$$
50 - 42 = 8 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Joe will have $8 left after the purchase.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**

- **Butter needed per dozen croissants**:  
  $ \frac{1}{4} $ pound of butter

- **Number of croissants made per day**:  
  4 dozen = 4 × 12 = 48 croissants

- **Number of days in a week**:  
  7 days

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total number of croissants made in a week**

$$
\text{Total croissants} = 4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total butter needed**

$$
\text{Total butter} = 28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen}
$$

$$
\text{Total butter} = \frac{28}{4} = 7 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Juan will need **7 pounds of butter** to make 4 dozen croissants each day for a week.
We are given:

- Cost to repave **1 meter** of street = **$194**
- Length of **Monica's street** = **150 meters**
- Length of **Lewis' street** = **490 meters**

We are asked: **How much more does it cost to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's?**

---

### Step 1: Find the cost to repave Monica's street

$$
\text{Cost for Monica} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{\$/meter} = 29,100 \, \text{\$}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the cost to repave Lewis' street

$$
\text{Cost for Lewis} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{\$/meter} = 95,060 \, \text{\$}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the difference in cost

$$
\text{Difference} = 95,060 - 29,100 = 65,960 \, \text{\$}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

It costs **$65,960 more** to repave Lewis' street than Monica's.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Initial Funding and Time
- **Initial funding**: $100,000
- **First 5 months**: This is the time period covered by the initial funding.
- So, for the first 5 months, he used **$100,000**.

### Step 2: Total Time of Research
- The research took **10 times longer** than the initial 5 months.
- That means the total time was:  
  $$
  10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
  $$

### Step 3: Time After the First 5 Months
- Total time: 50 months  
- First 5 months: already accounted for  
- Remaining time:  
  $$
  50 - 5 = 45 \text{ months}
  $$

### Step 4: Funding After the First 5 Months
- Every month **after** the first 5 months, the funding increased by **50% per month**.
- So, the monthly funding for the remaining 45 months is increasing each month by 50%.

This is a **geometric series** where:
- First term (month 6): $100,000 × 1.5 = $150,000
- Common ratio: 1.5
- Number of terms: 45 months

The formula for the sum of a geometric series is:
$$
S_n = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}
$$
Where:
- $a = 150,000$ (first term)
- $r = 1.5$ (common ratio)
- $n = 45$ (number of terms)

Now calculate:

$$
S_{45} = 150,000 \times \frac{(1.5)^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1}
$$

Let’s compute this step by step.

First, calculate $ (1.5)^{45} $. This is a large number, so we’ll use an approximate value or a calculator.

Using a calculator:
$$
(1.5)^{45} \approx 1.5^{45} \approx 2.97 \times 10^{10}
$$

So,
$$
\frac{(1.5)^{45} - 1}{0.5} \approx \frac{2.97 \times 10^{10}}{0.5} = 5.94 \times 10^{10}
$$

Then:
$$
S_{45} \approx 150,000 \times 5.94 \times 10^{10} = 8.91 \times 10^{15}
$$

That’s an astronomically large number — clearly, something is wrong.

Wait — that can't be right. Let’s re-express the problem more carefully.

---

### Let’s re-express the problem with correct interpretation:

He had **initial funding of $100,000 for the first 5 months**.

Then, the research took **10 times that long**, i.e., 50 months total.

So, the extra time beyond the first 5 months is:

$$
50 - 5 = 45 \text{ months}
$$

Now, the **funding per month increases by 50% every month after the first 5 months**.

So, starting from month 6, the funding per month is:

- Month 6: $100,000 × 1.5 = $150,000
- Month 7: $150,000 × 1.5 = $225,000
- Month 8: $225,000 × 1.5 = $337,500
- And so on...

This is a **geometric progression** where:
- First term $ a = 150,000 $
- Common ratio $ r = 1.5 $
- Number of terms $ n = 45 $

We want the **sum** of the first 45 terms of this geometric sequence.

Use the formula:

$$
S_n = a \cdot \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}
$$

Plug in the values:

$$
S_{45} = 150,000 \cdot \frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{1.5 - 1}
$$

Now calculate:

- $1.5^{45}$ is a huge number, but we can estimate it as:

$$
1.5^{45} \approx 1.5^{45} \approx 2.97 \times 10^{10}
$$

So,

$$
\frac{1.5^{45} - 1}{0.5} \approx \frac{2.97 \times 10^{10}}{0.5} = 5.94 \times 10^{10}
$$

Then:

$$
S_{45} \approx 150,000 \cdot 5.94 \times 10^{10} = 8.91 \times 10^{15}
$$

That’s **$8.91 \times 10^{15}$ dollars**, which is **$8.91 trillion**.

But that’s **way too high** for a realistic scenario. It suggests that either:
- The increase is not per month, or
- The question is using a **cumulative** increase (i.e., the total cost increases by 50% each month), which would make the total even higher.

Let’s assume the question meant that **each month after the first 5 months, the funding increases by 50% per month**, meaning the **monthly cost increases by 50% each month**.

In that case, the total cost is:

- First 5 months: $100,000
- Next 45 months: geometric series with first term $150,000$, ratio 1.5, 45 terms

So total cost:

$$
\text{Total cost} = 100,000 + S_{45}
$$

As before, $ S_{45} \approx 8.91 \times 10^{15} $

So total cost ≈ $8.91 \times 10^{15}$ dollars.

That’s **$8.91 trillion**.

But that seems extremely high — unless the question is just testing understanding of exponential growth.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{The total cost of the research was approximately } \$8.91 \times 10^{15}}
$$

Or, in dollar terms:

$$
\boxed{\$8.91 \text{ trillion}}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step to find the **total number of ounces of meat consumed** by the basketball team.

---

### Step 1: Understand the items eaten and their weights

We are told:

- **First player**: Aged a **6-ounce steak**  
  → That’s **6 ounces** of meat.

- **Second player**: Aged **beef tips**, which contain **8 beef tips**, each **1 ounce** in size  
  → So, total for this player = 8 × 1 = **8 ounces**

- **Third player**: Aged a **one-pound steak**  
  → Remember: **1 pound = 16 ounces**  
  → So, this is **16 ounces**

- **Fourth and fifth players**: Ordered **vegetarian meals**  
  → These do **not** contain meat, so they contribute **0 ounces**

---

### Step 2: Add up the meat consumed

Now we add up the meat from the first three players:

- First player: 6 ounces  
- Second player: 8 ounces  
- Third player: 16 ounces  

Total = 6 + 8 + 16 = **30 ounces**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**30 ounces** of meat were consumed by the team.
Sure! Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of days in March  
March has **31 days**.

---

### Step 2: Find the total number of posts per day  
Each of the 1000 members posts an average of **3 posts per day**.  
So, the total number of posts per day is:

$$
1000 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ posts/member/day} = 3000 \text{ posts/day}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of posts in March  
Now multiply the daily total by the number of days in March:

$$
3000 \text{ posts/day} \times 31 \text{ days} = 93,000 \text{ posts}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**93,000 posts** in March.

---

### **Step 1: Find out how many times Gary does laundry in a year.**

Gary does laundry **twice a week**.

There are **52 weeks** in a year.

So, the number of loads per year is:

$$
2 \text{ loads/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 104 \text{ loads/year}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find out how much water is used in a year.**

Each load uses **20 gallons** of water.

So, total water used per year is:

$$
104 \text{ loads} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 2080 \text{ gallons/year}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find out the cost of the water.**

Water costs **$0.15 per gallon**.

So, total cost per year is:

$$
2080 \text{ gallons} \times 0.15 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 312 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Gary spends **$312** on water for laundry in a year.

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how much meat Prince sells in one day**

- Prince sells **15 kg of meat per hour**.
- He works **10 hours a day**.

So, meat sold per day =  
$$
15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Total meat to sell**

Bill gives Prince a bull that weighs **750 kg**.

So, Prince needs to sell **750 kg** of meat.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how many days it will take**

We know:
- Meat sold per day = 150 kg
- Total meat to sell = 750 kg

Number of days =  
$$
\frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 5 days**.

### **Step 1: Total number of seats**

The auditorium has:

- 4 rows  
- 18 seats per row

So total number of seats is:

$$
4 \times 18 = 72 \text{ seats}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Seats occupied by administrators**

One-fourth of the seats were occupied by administrators:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 72 = 18 \text{ seats}
$$

So, remaining seats after administrators:

$$
72 - 18 = 54 \text{ seats}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Seats occupied by parents**

One-third of the remaining seats were occupied by parents:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 54 = 18 \text{ seats}
$$

So, remaining seats after parents:

$$
54 - 18 = 36 \text{ seats}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Seats occupied by students**

The rest of the seats were occupied by students:

$$
36 \text{ seats}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

### **Step 1: Determine the total number of street lights**

- Each **pole** has **4 street lights**.
- There are **6 poles** at each **intersection**.
- There are **4 intersections** on the road.

So, the total number of street lights is:

$$
\text{Total street lights} = 4 \text{ (lights per pole)} \times 6 \text{ (poles per intersection)} \times 4 \text{ (intersections)}
$$

$$
= 4 \times 6 \times 4 = 96 \text{ street lights}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Account for the non-working street lights**

We're told that **20 street lights are not working**.

So, the number of **functioning** street lights is:

$$
\text{Functioning street lights} = 96 - 20 = 76
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 76 functioning street lights**.

Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many pieces of gum Jim has left at the end of the day.

---

### **Step 1: Initial amount of gum**
Jim starts with a **20-pack** of gum.

---

### **Step 2: Gum chewed at school**

- He chews **1 piece every 2 hours**.
- His school day is **8 hours long**.
- So, he chews gum **8 ÷ 2 = 4 times** during the school day.
- That means he chews **4 pieces** of gum at school.

---

### **Step 3: Gum chewed on the way home and after dinner**

- He chews **1 piece on the way home**.
- He chews **1 piece after dinner**.
- That’s **2 more pieces**.

---

### **Step 4: Total gum chewed during the day**

So far, we have:

- 4 (at school) + 1 (on the way home) + 1 (after dinner) = **6 pieces** chewed.

---

### **Step 5: Remaining gum before giving to sister**

He started with **20 pieces**, so:

- 20 - 6 = **14 pieces** remaining.

---

### **Step 6: Giving half to his sister**

He gives **half** of the remaining gum to his sister.

- Half of 14 is **7 pieces**.

So he gives **7 pieces** to his sister.

---

### **Step 7: Final amount of gum left**

- 14 - 7 = **7 pieces**.

---

### ✅ **Answer: Jim has 7 pieces of gum left at the end of the day.**

Let's break this down step by step to find Ashley's internet connection speed in **Mb per hour**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**

- **Speed:** 20 **kb per second**
- **Conversion factor:** 1 **Mb = 1000 kb**
- **Time unit conversion:** 1 **hour = 60 minutes = 60 × 60 = 3600 seconds**

---

### **Step 2: Convert speed from kb/s to Mb/s**

We are given that 1 Mb = 1000 kb, so:

$$
\text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Convert speed from Mb/s to Mb/hour**

There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so:

$$
\text{Speed in Mb/hour} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/hour}

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information

- The tow truck pulls **10 cars per day** for the **first three days**.
- Then, it pulls **4 fewer cars per day** on the **remaining days of the week**.

So:
- First 3 days: 10 cars/day
- Remaining days: 10 - 4 = **6 cars/day**

---

### Step 2: Determine how many days are in the remaining part of the week

A week has **7 days**.

- First 3 days: 3 days
- Remaining days: 7 - 3 = **4 days**

---

### Step 3: Calculate total number of cars towed

- First 3 days:  
  $ 3 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ cars/day} = 30 \text{ cars} $

- Next 4 days:  
  $ 4 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ cars/day} = 24 \text{ cars} $

---

### Step 4: Add both amounts to get the total

$$
30 + 24 = \boxed{54}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **54 cars**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the requirements**

- To ride the roller coaster, Adam must be **at least 4 feet tall**.
- 1 foot = 12 inches, so:
  
  $$
  4 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches}
  $$

- So, Adam needs to be **at least 48 inches tall**.

---

### **Step 2: Current height of Adam**

- Adam is currently **40 inches tall**.

---

### **Step 3: Growth rate**

- Adam grows **2 inches per year**.

---

### **Step 4: How many inches does he need to grow?**

$$
48 \text{ inches (required)} - 40 \text{ inches (current)} = 8 \text{ inches}
$$

So, Adam needs to grow **8 inches** to be tall enough.

---

### **Step 5: How many years will it take?**

$$
\frac{8 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches/year}} = 4 \text{ years}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 4 years**.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total Revenue from Selling Cars**

James sold **10 cars**, each costing **$25,000**.

$$
\text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Cost to Acquire the Cars (Company’s Payment)**

The company paid **30% of the price** to acquire the cars.

$$
\text{Cost to Company} = 30\% \times 250,000 = 0.30 \times 250,000 = 75,000
$$

So, the **profit** for the company is:

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost to Company} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
$$

---

### **Step 3: James's Commission**

James gets a **10% commission on the profit**.

$$
\text{James's Commission} = 10\% \times 175,000 = 0.10 \times 175,000 = 17,500
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{17,500}
$$

James made **$17,500** from this sale.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of riders**
We are told there are **100 riders** in total.

---

### **Step 2: Percentage of riders who can stay upright**
When a wave over 30 feet arrives, **only 25%** of the riders can stay upright.

So, the number of riders who can stay upright is:

$$
25\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \text{ riders}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Percentage of these upright riders who are women**
Of the **25 riders** who can stay upright, **60%** are women.

So, the number of women who can stay upright is:

$$
60\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.60 \times 25 = 15 \text{ women}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Number of men who can stay upright**
Now, subtract the number of women from the total number of upright riders to find the number of **men** who can stay upright:

$$
25 \text{ upright riders} - 15 \text{ women} = 10 \text{ men}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{10}
$$

So, **10 men** can stay upright on the wave.
We are given the following information:

- The **price of a diamond jewel** is **$2000**.
- The **price of a gold jewel** is **4/5 times** the price of a diamond.
- The **price of a silver jewel** is **$400 less** than the price of a gold jewel.

We are to find the **total price for all three jewels**: diamond, gold, and silver.

---

### Step 1: Find the price of the gold jewel

The price of a gold jewel is **4/5 times** the price of a diamond:

$$
\text{Price of gold} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Price of diamond}
$$

$$
\text{Price of gold} = \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the price of the silver jewel

The price of a silver jewel is **$400 less** than the price of a gold jewel:

$$
\text{Price of silver} = \text{Price of gold} - 400 = 1600 - 400 = 1200
$$

---

### Step 3: Add up the prices of all three jewels

$$
\text{Total price} = \text{Diamond} + \text{Gold} + \text{Silver}
$$

$$
\text{Total price} = 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{4800}
$$

The total price for all three jewels is **$4800**.
We are given the following information about the stamps Max bought:

- **Snowflake stamps**: 16
- **Truck stamps**: 3 more than snowflake stamps
- **Rose stamps**: 9 fewer than truck stamps

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of **truck stamps**

Max bought **3 more truck stamps** than snowflake stamps.

$$
\text{Truck stamps} = \text{Snowflake stamps} + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the number of **rose stamps**

Max bought **9 fewer rose stamps** than truck stamps.

$$
\text{Rose stamps} = \text{Truck stamps} - 9 = 19 - 9 = 10
$$

---

### Step 3: Add all the stamps together

Now we add up all the stamps:

$$
\text{Total stamps} = \text{Snowflake} + \text{Truck} + \text{Rose} = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Max bought a total of 45 stamps.**
We are given:

- **Bob** is **75 miles ahead** of **Tom**.
- **Bob's speed** = 55 mph
- **Tom's speed** = 70 mph

We want to find how long it will take **Tom** to **catch up** with **Bob**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the situation

- Bob is ahead by 75 miles.
- Tom is faster (70 mph vs. 55 mph), so he will eventually catch up.
- The **relative speed** between Tom and Bob is:

$$
\text{Relative speed} = \text{Tom's speed} - \text{Bob's speed} = 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ mph}
$$

This means Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of **15 miles per hour**.

---

### Step 2: Use the formula for time

We can use the formula:

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
$$

Here, the distance Tom needs to cover to catch up is **75 miles**, and his **relative speed** is **15 mph**.

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{75}{15} = 5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{5 \text{ hours}}
$$

It will take **Tom 5 hours** to catch up with Bob.

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find how many fish Darren caught

Darren caught **6 less** than Naomi, and Naomi caught **17 fish**.

$$
\text{Darren's fish} = 17 - 6 = 11
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many fish Tommy caught

Tommy caught **3 more** than Darren.

$$
\text{Tommy's fish} = 11 + 3 = 14
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{14}
$$

Tommy caught **14 fish**.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- Manny signed up for **10 classes**.
- The **total cost is $60**.
- His parents will **not sign him up again** if the **cost per class exceeds $10**.
- We are to find how many **classes he can miss** before the **cost per class becomes more than $10**.

---

### **Step 1: Find the cost per class if all 10 classes are attended.**

$$
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of classes}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class}
$$

So, if he attends **all 10 classes**, the cost per class is **$6**, which is **less than $10** — so his parents would **not** stop him.

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many classes he can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10.**

Let’s say he misses **x classes**. That means he attends **(10 - x) classes**.

The cost per class would then be:

$$
\text{Cost per class} = \frac{60}{10 - x}
$$

We want to find the **maximum value of x** such that:

$$
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
$$

Solve this inequality:

$$
\frac{60}{10 - x} \leq 10
$$

Multiply both sides by (10 - x), assuming $10 - x > 0$ (which it is as long as x < 10):

$$
60 \leq 10(10 - x)
$$

$$
60 \leq 100 - 10x
$$

Subtract 100 from both sides:

$$
-40 \leq -10x
$$

Divide both sides by -10 (and reverse the inequality):

$$
4 \geq x
$$

So, **x ≤ 4**

---

### **Conclusion:**

Manny can miss **up to 4 classes** before the **cost per class exceeds $10**.

If he misses **5 or more classes**, then the cost per class would be more than $10, and his parents will **not sign him up again**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**He can miss 4 classes before they don't sign him up again.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**

- **Jewel processes 50 customers per day.**
- **Julie operates the cash register exactly twice as fast as Jewel.**
- We are to find the **total weekly production (i.e., total number of customers processed in a week)** for **both** Julie and Jewel.

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many customers Julie processes per day**

Since Julie is **twice as fast** as Jewel, and Jewel processes **50 customers per day**, then:

$$
\text{Julie's daily processing} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers/day}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate daily total for both**

- **Jewel:** 50 customers/day  
- **Julie:** 100 customers/day  
- **Total per day:** $ 50 + 100 = 150 $ customers/day

---

### **Step 4: Multiply by 7 days in a week**

$$
\text{Weekly total} = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \text{ customers/week}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{1050}
$$

So, the **total weekly production** for both Julie and Jewel is **1050 customers**.
We are given the following information:

- **Paisley ran 4 miles.**
- **Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran** and **3 miles farther than Lynn.**

We need to find out how many miles **Lynn ran**.

---

### Step 1: Find how far Reggie ran

Reggie ran **5 times what Paisley ran**:

$$
\text{Reggie's distance} = 5 \times \text{Paisley's distance} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the fact that Reggie ran 3 miles farther than Lynn

Let $ L $ be the number of miles **Lynn ran**.

Then:

$$
\text{Reggie's distance} = L + 3
$$

We already found that Reggie ran **20 miles**, so:

$$
L + 3 = 20
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ L $

$$
L = 20 - 3 = 17
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Lynn ran 17 miles.**
We are given:

- **4 apples cost $5.20**
- **3 oranges cost $3.30**

We need to find the total cost of **5 apples and 5 oranges**.

---

### Step 1: Find the cost of one apple

$$
\text{Cost of 1 apple} = \frac{5.20}{4} = 1.30
$$

So, **1 apple costs $1.30**.

---

### Step 2: Find the cost of one orange

$$
\text{Cost of 1 orange} = \frac{3.30}{3} = 1.10
$$

So, **1 orange costs $1.10**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of 5 apples and 5 oranges

$$
\text{Cost of 5 apples} = 5 \times 1.30 = 6.50
$$
$$
\text{Cost of 5 oranges} = 5 \times 1.10 = 5.50
$$

$$
\text{Total cost} = 6.50 + 5.50 = 12.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Clyde will pay $12.00.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Find the volume of the hole**

The hole is a rectangular prism, so its volume is calculated as:

\text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
$$

Given:
- Length = 6 feet  
- Width = 4 feet  
- Depth = 3 feet  

$$
\text{Volume} = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the time to dig the hole**

Bob takes **3 seconds** to shovel **1 cubic foot** of earth.

So, for 72 cubic feet:

$$
\text{Time} = 72 \times 3 = 216 \text{ seconds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{216} \text{ seconds}

Let's break down the costs step by step.

---

### **Base Price of the Truck:**
$$
\$30,000
$$

---

### **King Cab Upgrade:**
$$
\$7,500
$$

---

### **Leather Seats:**
- "One-third the cost of the king cab upgrade"
$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = \$2,500
$$

---

### **Running Boards:**
- "500 less than the leather seats"
$$
2,500 - 500 = \$2,000
$$

---

### **Upgraded Exterior Light Package:**
$$
\$1,500

---

### **Now, add all the extra features to the base price:**

$$
\text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500
$$

Let’s calculate:

$$
30,000 + 7,500 = 37,500 \\
37,500 + 2,500 = 40,000 \\
40,000 + 2,000 = 42,000 \\
42,000 + 1,500 = 43,500
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{43,500}
$$

The total cost of Bill's new truck is **\$43,500**.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much Tim will make in a year.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the new monthly salary after the raise**

Tim's original salary is **$20,000 per month**.

He gets a **5% raise**:

$$
\text{Raise amount} = 20,000 \times 0.05 = 1,000
$$

$$
\text{New monthly salary} = 20,000 + 1,000 = 21,000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Add the bonus**

He also gets a **bonus worth half a month's salary**:

$$
\text{Bonus} = \frac{21,000}{2} = 10,500
$$

So his **total monthly income** is:

$$
21,000 + 10,500 = 31,500
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate annual income**

Now, we multiply the total monthly income by 12 (months in a year):

$$
\text{Annual income} = 31,500 \times 12 = 378,000
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{378,000}
$$

Tim will make **$378,000** in a year.
Let's break down the problem step by step and calculate the total cost.

### **Step 1: Suits**
- James buys **10 suits**.
- Each suit costs **$750**.

$$
\text{Total cost of suits} = 10 \times 750 = 7500
$$

---

### **Step 2: Dress Pants**
- He buys **10 dress pants**.
- The cost of each pair of dress pants is **1/5 the cost of a suit**.

$$
\text{Cost of one pair of dress pants} = \frac{1}{5} \times 750 = 150
$$

$$
\text{Total cost of dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = 1500
$$

---

### **Step 3: Dress Shirts**
- He buys **3 dress shirts per suit**, so for 10 suits:

$$
\text{Total number of dress shirts} = 10 \times 3 = 30
$$

- Each dress shirt costs **$60**.

$$
\text{Total cost of dress shirts} = 30 \times 60 = 1800
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total Cost**

Now, add up all the costs:

$$
\text{Total cost} = 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$

---

### Step 2: Find the age of Steve's son

Their son is **half as old as his mom (his wife)**.

$$
\text{Son's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times 64 = 32 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the age of the son's wife

The son's wife is **3 years younger than her husband (the son)**.

$$
\text{Son's wife's age} = 32 - 3 = 29 \text{ years old}

Let's calculate the total distance each person biked and then add them together.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate Alisa's distance**

Alisa's speed = 12 miles per hour  
Time = 4.5 hours  

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 12 \times 4.5 = 54 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Stanley's distance**

Stanley's speed = 10 miles per hour  
Time = 2.5 hours  

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \times 2.5 = 25 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add both distances**

$$
\text{Total distance} = 54 + 25 = 79 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **79 miles**
We are given:

- Bill digs **4 feet per hour** through **soil**.
- He digs **half that fast** through **clay**, so that’s **2 feet per hour** through clay.
- He needs to dig **24 feet of soil** and **8 feet of clay**.

---

### Step 1: Time to dig through soil

$$
\text{Time through soil} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{24 \text{ ft}}{4 \text{ ft/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 2: Time to dig through clay

$$
\text{Time through clay} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ ft}}{2 \text{ ft/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total time

$$
\text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = \boxed{10 \text{ hours}}

### **Day 1: Clara's Purchase**

- **Number of pomegranates:** 20  
- **Original price per pomegranate:** $20  
- **Total cost before discount:**  
  $$
  20 \times 20 = 400
  $$  
- **Discount (voucher):** $2 off  
- **Final price paid by Clara:**  
  $$
  400 - 2 = 398
  $$

---

### **Day 2: Sheila's Purchase**

- **Number of pomegranates:** 20  
- **Price per pomegranate:** $30  
- **Total cost before discount:**  
  $$
  20 \times 30 = 600
  $$  
- **Discount offered:** 10% on total cost  
  $$
  10\% \text{ of } 600 = 0.10 \times 600 = 60
  $$  
- **Final price paid by Sheila:**  
  $$
  600 - 60 = 540
  $$

---

### **Difference in Final Prices Paid**

$$
540 - 398 = 142
$$

---

### ✅ **Answer: The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the first month's sales**

We are told:

- Sales from **red hats** in the first month = **$400**
- Sales from **green hats** in the first month = **twice** the red hat sales (since red sales were **half** of green sales)

So:

$$
\text{Green hat sales} = 2 \times 400 = 800
$$

Therefore, **total sales in the first month** is:

$$
400 + 800 = 1200
$$

---

### **Step 2: Understand the second month's sales**

We're told that in the **second month**, her total sales were **3/4 of the first month's total sales**.

So:

$$
\text{Second month sales} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total sales over two months**

$$
\text{Total sales} = 1200 + 900 = 2100
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $2100**
Let's break this down step by step.

### 1. **Total Time Spent:**
James hires the carriage from **5 PM to 9 PM**, which is **4 hours**.

### 2. **Free Hour:**
He gets **1 hour free**, so the actual paid time is:

$$
4 \text{ hours} - 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

### 3. **Cost Structure:**
- The **first paid hour** costs **$15**.
- Each **subsequent hour** is **twice the cost** of the previous one.

So, let's calculate the cost for each of the 3 paid hours:

- **1st hour:** $15  
- **2nd hour:** $15 × 2 = $30  
- **3rd hour:** $30 × 2 = $60  

### 4. **Total Cost:**

$$
15 + 30 + 60 = 105
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**James paid $105.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the situation**

- Sally started the week with **$200** in her bank account.
- At the end of the week, her bank account has **$420**.
- She received **no other money** into her account during the week.
- Her **weekly wage should be $300**, but she didn't receive the full amount.
- We are asked: **How much was withheld from her wage?**

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how much money Sally received this week**

Since she started with $200 and ended with $420, and she received **no other money**, the **entire increase in her account** must come from her **wage**.

$$
\text{Money received} = \text{Ending balance} - \text{Starting balance} = 420 - 200 = 220
$$

So, Sally received **$220** this week.

---

### **Step 3: Determine how much was withheld**

Her **weekly wage should have been $300**, but she only received **$220**. That means:

$$
\text{Withheld amount} = \text{Expected wage} - \text{Actual wage received} = 300 - 220 = 80
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $80** was withheld from Sally’s wage.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many deviled egg halves Lori needs**

- Each guest eats **3 deviled egg halves**.
- She is inviting **16 guests**.

$$
\text{Total deviled egg halves needed} = 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves per guest} = 48 \text{ halves}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many whole eggs are needed**

- **1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves**.
- So, to get 48 halves:

$$
\text{Number of eggs needed} = \frac{48 \text{ halves}}{2 \text{ halves per egg}} = 24 \text{ eggs}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Convert eggs to dozens**

- There are **12 eggs in a dozen**.

$$
\text{Number of dozens} = \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozen}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{2} \text{ dozen eggs}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1:**  
Shiela is required to write a **15-page** research paper.

**Step 2:**  
She has already finished writing **1/3** of the paper.

So, the number of pages she has already written is:  
$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages}
$$

**Step 3:**  
To find out how many pages she has left to write, subtract the pages she has already written from the total pages:

$$
15 - 5 = 10 \text{ pages}
$$

**Answer:** Shiela has **10 pages left to write**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Given:
- The book has **200 pages**.
- Mike reads **10 pages per day**.
- The assignment must be completed within **30 days**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate how many days Mike needs to finish the book.

If Mike reads **10 pages per day**, then the number of days he needs to read the whole book is:

$$
\frac{200 \text{ pages}}{10 \text{ pages/day}} = 20 \text{ days}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many days before the deadline Mike will finish.

The assignment is due in **30 days**, and Mike finishes in **20 days**. So, the number of days before the deadline he will finish is:

$$
30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.**
Let's break this down step by step to find the total cost for James to **get and maintain the plane for the first year**.

---

### **1. Cost of the Plane**
- James buys the plane for:  
  **$150,000**

---

### **2. Monthly Maintenance Costs**

- **Hanger rental**: $5,000 per month  
- **Fuel**: Twice that amount = $5,000 × 2 = **$10,000 per month**

So, **total monthly cost** =  
$5,000 (hanger) + $10,000 (fuel) = **$15,000 per month**

---

### **3. Annual Maintenance Cost**

There are 12 months in a year, so:

- Total annual maintenance cost = $15,000 × 12 = **$180,000**

---

### **4. Total Cost for First Year**

- Cost of the plane: $150,000  
- Annual maintenance cost: $180,000  

**Total cost = $150,000 + $180,000 = $330,000**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $330,000**
We are given the following information:

- Finley bought **rice**, **beans**, and **pork**.
- It took her **20 more minutes to cook pork than rice**.
- **Beans took half the combined cooking time of pork and rice**.
- It took her **30 minutes to cook rice**.

We are asked: **How long in total did it take to cook all the food?**

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s define:

- Let $ R $ = time to cook **rice** (in minutes)
- Let $ P $ = time to cook **pork** (in minutes)
- Let $ B $ = time to cook **beans** (in minutes)

From the problem:

- $ R = 30 $ minutes
- $ P = R + 20 = 30 + 20 = 50 $ minutes
- $ B = \frac{1}{2}(P + R) $

---

### Step 2: Calculate time for beans

$$
B = \frac{1}{2}(P + R) = \frac{1}{2}(50 + 30) = \frac{1}{2}(80) = 40 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total time to cook all food

$$
\text{Total time} = R + P + B = 30 + 50 + 40 = 120 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{120} \text{ minutes}

- **1/3 pound walnuts**

### **Mixture 2:**
- **1/5 pound almonds**
- **1/3 pound walnuts**

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of each mixture

#### **Cost of Mixture 1:**
- Cost of almonds:  
  $ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 $ dollars  
- Cost of walnuts:  
  $ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 $ dollars  
- **Total cost of Mixture 1:**  
  $ 5 + 5 = 10 $ dollars

#### **Cost of Mixture 2:**
- Cost of almonds:  
  $ \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 $ dollars  
- Cost of walnuts:  
  $ \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 $ dollars  
- **Total cost of Mixture 2:**  
  $ 2 + 5 = 7 $ dollars

---

### Step 2: Find the difference in cost

$$
10 - 7 = 3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
It costs **$3 more** for the first mixture than the second.
We are given:

- Lee rears **only sheep and geese**.
- Total number of **animal heads** = 20
- Total number of **animal legs** = 70

Let’s define:

- Let $ s $ = number of **sheep**
- Let $ g $ = number of **geese**

### Step 1: Set up equations based on the information

Each animal has **1 head**, so:

$$
s + g = 20 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
$$

Each **sheep** has **4 legs**, and each **goose** has **2 legs**, so:

$$
4s + 2g = 70 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve the system of equations

From Equation 1:

$$
g = 20 - s
$$

Substitute into Equation 2:

$$
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
$$

Simplify:

$$
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
$$
$$
2s + 40 = 70
$$
$$
2s = 30
$$
$$
s = 15
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{15} \text{ sheep}
$$

So, **15 sheep** live on Lee's farm.

$$
\text{New price} = 5 + (0.20 \times 5) = 5 + 1 = \$6 \text{ per pound}
$$

---

### 2. **How much coffee does Roger buy?**
- He buys **a week's worth of coffee**.
- He uses **1 pound per day**.
- So, he buys **7 pounds** of coffee.

$$
\text{Cost of coffee} = 7 \times 6 = \$42
$$

---

### 3. **Cost of the donut:**
- He buys **one donut** for **$2**.

$$
\text{Cost of donut} = \$2
$$

---

### 4. **Total cost:**
$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of coffee} + \text{Cost of donut} = 42 + 2 = \$44
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**\$44**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

Gus spent a total of **$20.00** at the grocery store.

He bought the following items:

- **2 bags of chips** at **$2.00 each**:  
  $ 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00 $

- **1 bucket of fried chicken** for **$8.00**

- **1 bottle of soda** for **$1.00**

Now, let's add up the cost of these items:

$$
4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00
$$

So far, Gus has spent **$13.00** on those items.

He had a total of **$20.00**, so the remaining amount must have been spent on the **apple pie**.

$$
20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: The apple pie cost **$7.00**.
We are given the following information:

- James delivers **600 newspapers** in total in a day.
- He delivers **198 newspapers** to **District A**.
- He delivers **209 newspapers** to **District C**.
- We need to find how many newspapers he delivers to **District B**.

---

### Step 1: Write the total number of newspapers delivered

$$
\text{Total} = \text{A} + \text{B} + \text{C}
$$

$$
600 = 198 + \text{B} + 209
$$

---

### Step 2: Add the known values

$$
198 + 209 = 407
$$

So,

$$
600 = 407 + \text{B}
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for B

$$
\text{B} = 600 - 407 = 193
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{193}
$$

James delivers **193 newspapers** to District B.
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Total class time**
- The class meets **4 times a week**.
- Each class is **2 hours long**.
- It runs for **6 weeks**.

So, total class time =  
$$
4 \text{ classes/week} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 48 \text{ hours}
$$

### 2. **Number of recipes learned**
- John learns **1 recipe every 1.5 hours**.

So, number of recipes =  
$$
\frac{48 \text{ hours}}{1.5 \text{ hours/recipe}} = 32 \text{ recipes}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**John learns 32 recipes.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of teachers**
We are told there are **150 teachers** on the school basketball court.

---

### **Step 2: Number of history teachers**
60% of the teachers are history teachers.

$$
\text{Number of history teachers} = 60\% \times 150 = 0.6 \times 150 = 90
$$

---

### **Step 3: Number of math teachers**
The rest of the teachers are math teachers.

$$
\text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60
$$

---

### **Step 4: Time each math teacher sleeps per day**
Each teacher sleeps for **6 hours a day**.

---

### **Step 5: Total time math teachers spend sleeping in one day**
Now, multiply the number of math teachers by the time each sleeps per day:

$$
\text{Total sleep time} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{360} \text{ hours}
$$

So, the math teachers collectively spend **360 hours** sleeping in one day.
We are given the following:

- **Aurelia (Arelia)** has $120.
- **Kassidy** has **3/4 times** as much money as Aurelia.
- **Rayna** has **$60 more** than Kassidy.
- They all decide to **add together their money and share equally** among them.

---

### Step 1: Find how much Kassidy has

Kassidy has **3/4 of what Aurelia has**:

$$
\text{Kassidy} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how much Rayna has

Rayna has **$60 more** than Kassidy:

$$
\text{Rayna} = 90 + 60 = 150
$$

---

### Step 3: Total amount of money

Add up all their money:

$$
\text{Total} = 120 (\text{Aurelia}) + 90 (\text{Kassidy}) + 150 (\text{Rayna}) = 360
$$

---

### Step 4: Share equally among them

There are **3 people**, so each person gets:

$$
\frac{360}{3} = 120
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

- **Aurelia**: $120  
- **Kassidy**: $120  
- **Rayna**: $120  

Each would have **$120** after sharing equally.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Regular Game Time**:  
   Sarah’s basketball games are made up of **4 quarters**, and each quarter is **12 minutes long**.  
   So, the total regular game time is:  
   $$
   4 \text{ quarters} \times 12 \text{ minutes per quarter} = 48 \text{ minutes}
   $$

2. **Extended Time for the Last Quarter**:  
   In the **last quarter**, there was a tie, so the game was **extended by 5 minutes**.

3. **Total Game Time**:  
   Add the regular game time and the extra time:  
   $$
   48 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 53 \text{ minutes}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **53 minutes**.
Let's solve this step by step.

### **Step 1: Total number of employees**
The company has **50 employees**.

---

### **Step 2: Number of management employees**
20% of the employees are in **management**.

$$
20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ employees}
$$

So, there are **10 management employees**.

---

### **Step 3: Number of management employees who oversee the entire company**
Out of these 10 management employees, **30%** oversee the entire company.

$$
30\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3 \text{ employees}
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{3} \text{ employees oversee the company.}
$$
We are given the amounts of dry ingredients needed for **one muffin**, and we need to find out how much is needed for **16 muffins**.

---

### Step 1: Find the total amount of each ingredient per muffin

#### Flour:
$$
5 \times 16 = 80 \text{ tablespoons}
$$

#### Sugar:
$$
3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ tablespoons}
$$

#### Salt:
$$
0.25 \times 16 = 4 \text{ tablespoons}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add them all together to get the total dry ingredients

$$
80 + 48 + 4 = 132 \text{ tablespoons}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Svetlana would need 132 tablespoons of dry ingredients to make 16 muffins.**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find the total amount of candy**

Robert had **3 pounds**,  
Cindy had **5 pounds**,  
Aaron had **4 pounds**.

So, total candy =  
$$
3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Divide the total equally among the three of them**

There are **3 people**: Robert, Cindy, and Aaron.

Each person gets:  
$$
\frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of type A candies

Adam bought **7 candies of type A**, and each costs **$0.50**.

$$
\text{Cost of A} = 7 \times 0.50 = 3.50
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of type B candies

Adam bought **10 candies of type B**, and each costs **$0.75**.

$$
\text{Cost of B} = 10 \times 0.75 = 7.50
$$

---

### Step 3: Total cost of all candies

$$
\text{Total cost} = 3.50 + 7.50 = 11.00
$$

---

### Step 4: Calculate the change Adam received

Adam paid **$15.00**, and the total cost was **$11.00**.

$$
\text{Change} = 15.00 - 11.00 = 4.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Adam received $4.00 in change.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total Days in the Month**
Christina has recorded moods for **30 days**.

---

### **Step 2: Moods in the First 24 Days**
She records moods in **three blocks of 8 days**:

- **First 8 days**: All **good** → 8 good days
- **Second 8 days**: All **bad** → 8 bad days
- **Third 8 days**: All **neutral** → 8 neutral days

So, in the first 24 days:
- Good days = 8
- Bad days = 8
- Neutral days = 8

---

### **Step 3: Next 3 Days**
The next 3 days are:
- Day 25: **Good**
- Day 26: **Neutral**
- Day 27: **Good**

So, in these 3 days:
- Good days = 2 (Days 25 and 27)
- Neutral days = 1 (Day 26)

---

### **Step 4: Total Good Days So Far**
From the first 24 days: 8 good days  
From the next 3 days: 2 good days  
Total good days = **8 + 2 = 10**

---

### **Step 5: Total Days in the Month**
There are 30 days in total.

So, the number of **good days left** in the month is:

$$
\text{Total good days} = 10 \\
\text{Total days} = 30 \\
\text{Remaining days} = 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ days}
$$

We don't know what the mood of the last 3 days (Days 28, 29, 30) will be. However, the question asks:

> **How many good days were left in the month?**

This means it’s asking how many **good days remain to be recorded** in the remaining 3 days.

But we don’t have any information about the mood of those 3 days. Therefore, we **cannot determine** how many good days are left — unless we assume that the pattern continues or that the remaining days are not good.

However, the question seems to imply that we are to find how many **good days are still unaccounted for**, based on what is already known.

But wait — let's clarify:

We are told:
- She had **12 good days** in the past 30 days.
- We have accounted for **10 good days** so far.
- That leaves **2 good days** unaccounted for in the remaining 3 days.

Therefore, the answer is:

$$
\boxed{2}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**2 good days are left in the month.**
We are given the following information:

- Janey has **21 books**.
- Janey has **3 more than twice** the number of books that Sally has.

Let’s define the number of books Sally has as **x**.

According to the problem, Janey has **3 more than twice** the number of books Sally has. So we can write this as an equation:

$$
\text{Janey's books} = 2 \times (\text{Sally's books}) + 3
$$

Substitute the known value for Janey's books:

$$
21 = 2x + 3
$$

Now solve for **x**:

1. Subtract 3 from both sides:
   $$
   21 - 3 = 2x
   $$
   $$
   18 = 2x
   $$

2. Divide both sides by 2:
   $$
   x = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: Sally has **9 books**.
We are given:

- The bamboo grows **30 inches per day**.
- Today, its height is **20 feet**.
- We need to find out **in how many days** the bamboo will reach a height of **600 inches**.

---

### Step 1: Convert the current height to inches

Since 1 foot = 12 inches,

$$
20 \text{ feet} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ inches}
$$

So today, the bamboo is **240 inches tall**.

---

### Step 2: Find the difference between 600 inches and 240 inches

$$
600 - 240 = 360 \text{ inches}
$$

The bamboo needs to grow **360 inches** more to reach 600 inches.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the number of days needed to grow 360 inches at 30 inches per day

$$
\frac{360}{30} = 12 \text{ days}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{12} \text{ days}
$$
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Situation**

- James has **4 toys** for **4 dogs**.
- There are **8 more dogs** in the shelter now.

So, **initial total number of dogs** = 4 (already accounted for) + 8 (new) = **12 dogs**.

James needs **1 toy per dog**, so he initially needs **12 toys**.

But he already has **4 toys**, so he needs to buy:

$$
12 - 4 = 8 \text{ toys}
$$

---

### **Step 2: After Buying Toys**

After buying the 8 toys, he goes back and sees that **there are twice as many more dogs than when he left**.

At the time he first left, there were **8 more dogs**, so now there are:

$$
8 \times 2 = 16 \text{ more dogs}
$$

So the **total number of dogs now is**:

$$
4 \text{ (original)} + 16 \text{ (new)} = 20 \text{ dogs}
$$

He needs **20 toys**.

He already has **4 original toys** + **8 new toys** = **12 toys**.

So he needs to buy:

$$
20 - 12 = 8 \text{ more toys}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Final Adjustment**

Then he comes back again and sees that **3 dogs have left**.

So the **current number of dogs is**:

$$
20 - 3 = 17 \text{ dogs}
$$

Now he only needs **17 toys**.

He already has **12 toys**, so he needs to buy:

$$
17 - 12 = 5 \text{ more toys}
$$

---

### **Final Answer: Total number of toys James needs**

He bought:
- 8 toys initially
- 8 more toys after the increase
- 5 more toys after the 3 dogs left

$$
8 + 8 + 5 = \boxed{21} \text{ toys}
$$

---

✅ **Answer: James needs a total of 21 toys.**
We are given that **three people**—Dylan, Frances, and Skyler—invested a total of **$1200** in a joint savings account.

We are told:

- **Dylan** invested **2/5 of the total amount**.
- **Frances** invested **2/3 of the remaining amount** after Dylan.
- **Skyler** invested the rest.

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Total investment

Total amount = $1200

---

### Step 2: Dylan's investment

Dylan invested **2/5 of the total amount**:

$$
\text{Dylan} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = 480
$$

So, Dylan invested **$480**

---

### Step 3: Remaining amount after Dylan

$$
\text{Remaining} = 1200 - 480 = 720
$$

---

### Step 4: Frances's investment

Frances invested **2/3 of the remaining amount** (which is $720):

$$
\text{Frances} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720 = 480
$$

So, Frances invested **$480**

---

### Step 5: Skyler's investment

Skyler invested the **rest**, which is the total minus what Dylan and Frances invested:

$$
\text{Skyler} = 1200 - 480 - 480 = 240
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{240}
$$

Skyler's investment was **$240**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Current number of signatures**

- **Carol** has **20** signatures.
- **Jennifer** has **44** signatures.

So, together, they currently have:

$$
20 + 44 = 64 \text{ signatures}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Their goal**

They want to reach **100 signatures** by the end of summer.

So, how many more signatures do they need?

$$
100 - 64 = 36 \text{ signatures needed}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Time left**

They have **three more weeks** of summer vacation. Since they collect **one signature per day**, we can assume they will collect **3 weeks × 7 days/week = 21 days** of collecting.

But the question doesn’t ask how many they need to collect per day — it just asks **how many signatures they need to collect in total** to reach their goal.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{36}
$$

The sisters need to collect **36 more signatures** to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of summer.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Find Karen's hourly rate  
Lorie earns **$10 per hour**, and **Karen earns twice** that amount.

$$
\text{Karen's hourly rate} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per hour}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate how many hours Karen works in two days  
Karen works **3 hours per day**, so in **2 days**:

$$
\text{Total hours worked} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate Karen's total earnings for two days  
Now multiply her hourly rate by the total number of hours she works:

$$
\text{Total earnings} = 20 \times 6 = 120 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Karen earns $120 in two days.**
We are given:

- 6 potatoes make **36 hash browns**.

We need to find out how many hash browns can be made from **96 potatoes**.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of hash browns per potato

From the given information:

$$
\frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato}
$$

So, **each potato makes 6 hash browns**.

---

### Step 2: Multiply by the number of potatoes

Now, if we have **96 potatoes**, and each potato makes **6 hash browns**, then:

$$
96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{576}
$$

You can make **576 hash browns** from 96 potatoes.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the total weight of the people in the elevator**

- Jack is one of the 8 adults.
- So, there are **9 adults** in total (Jack + 8 others).
- Each adult weighs an average of **80 kg**.

$$
\text{Total weight} = 9 \times 80 = 720 \, \text{kg}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Compare with the maximum load capacity**

- The elevator can support a **maximum load of 700 kg**.
- The total weight of the 9 adults is **720 kg**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how much they have exceeded the limit**

$$
\text{Exceeded weight} = 720 - 700 = 20 \, \text{kg}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

They will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by **20 kg**.
We are given the following information:

- Katarina has **68** cookies.
- Katarina has **5 less** than Max.
- Max has **12 more** than the Cookie Monster.
- Summer has **23 more** than Max.

We need to find the **total number of cookies** that Katarina, Max, the Cookie Monster, and Summer have.

---

### Step 1: Find how many cookies Max has

Katarina has 68 cookies, and she has 5 less than Max.

$$
\text{Max's cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + 5 = 68 + 5 = 73
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many cookies the Cookie Monster has

Max has 12 more than the Cookie Monster.

$$
\text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} - 12 = 73 - 12 = 61
$$

---

### Step 3: Find how many cookies Summer has

Summer has 23 more than Max.

$$
\text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96
$$

---

### Step 4: Add up all the cookies

Now we add up the number of cookies each person has:

- Katarina: 68  
- Max: 73  
- Cookie Monster: 61  
- Summer: 96  

$$
\text{Total} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
$$

Let’s compute this step by step:

$$
68 + 73 = 141 \\
141 + 61 = 202 \\
202 + 96 = 298
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{298}
$$

They have a total of **298 cookies**.
We are given:

- Shania **extends** the dress by **50% of its original length**.
- She also **adds 20 cm** to the bottom with lace trim.
- The **final length** of the dress is **140 cm**.

Let’s define the **original length** of the dress as $ x $ cm.

---

### Step 1: Express the final length in terms of $ x $

- Extending the dress by 50% means she adds $ 0.5x $ to the original length.
- Then she adds an additional **20 cm** to the bottom.

So the **final length** is:

$$
x + 0.5x + 20 = 140
$$

---

### Step 2: Simplify the equation

$$
1.5x + 20 = 140
$$

Subtract 20 from both sides:

$$
1.5x = 120
$$

Divide both sides by 1.5:

$$
x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{80} \text{ cm}
$$

So, the **original length** of the dress was **80 cm**.
We are told:

- Chris can mow **the entire lawn** in **1 hour (60 minutes)** in **turtle mode**.
- He can mow the **entire lawn** in **40 minutes** in **rabbit mode**.
- Today, he mowed **half the lawn in turtle mode**, and **half the lawn in rabbit mode**.

We are to find: **How many minutes did it take him to mow the entire lawn?**

---

### Step 1: Determine the mowing rates

Let’s define:

- Let the **total area of the lawn** be 1 unit (for simplicity).
- In **turtle mode**, he mows the entire lawn in 60 minutes → his rate is:

$$
\text{Rate}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1}{60} \text{ (lawn per minute)}
$$

- In **rabbit mode**, he mows the entire lawn in 40 minutes → his rate is:

$$
\text{Rate}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ (lawn per minute)}
$$

---

### Step 2: Mow half the lawn in each mode

He mows **half the lawn** in **turtle mode**, and **half the lawn** in **rabbit mode**.

So:

- Time to mow half the lawn in **turtle mode**:

$$
\text{Time}_{\text{turtle}} = \frac{1/2}{1/60} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
$$

- Time to mow half the lawn in **rabbit mode**:

$$
\text{Time}_{\text{rabbit}} = \frac{1/2}{1/40} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total time

Add the two times together:

$$
\text{Total time} = 30 + 20 = \boxed{50} \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{50} \text{ minutes}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total time they have**
John and Jack have **30 minutes** to get to school.

---

### **Step 2: Time already spent**
They walk to the **library**, which takes **6 minutes**, and then to the **fire station**, which takes **13 minutes**.

So, total time spent so far is:

$$
6 + 13 = 19 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Time remaining**
Now we subtract the time already spent from the total time they have:

$$
30 - 19 = 11 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
They have **11 minutes** left to get to school without being late.

$$

---

**Step 2: Find the total number of cookies baked.**

$$
\text{Total cookies} = \text{Greta's cookies} + \text{Celinda's cookies} = 30 + 60 = 90
$$

---

**Step 3: Subtract the number of cookies eaten.**

They eat **10 cookies** while they are cooling.

$$
\text{Cookies left} = 90 - 10 = 80
$$

---

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{80}
$$

There are **80 cookies** in the box.
We are given:

- There is **one set of twins** and **one set of triplets**.
- One **twin is 7 years older than one triplet**.
- The **combined ages** of all four children is **44**.
- We are to find the **age of one of the twins**.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s define:

- Let the age of **each twin** be $ T $
- Let the age of **each triplet** be $ S $

There are **2 twins** and **3 triplets**, so the total number of children is 5.

But we are told that **one twin is 7 years older than one triplet**, so:

$$
T = S + 7
$$

---

### Step 2: Write the equation for total age

The total age of all five children is:

$$
2T + 3S = 44
$$

Now substitute $ T = S + 7 $ into this equation:

$$
2(S + 7) + 3S = 44
$$

---

### Step 3: Simplify and solve

$$
2S + 14 + 3S = 44
$$
$$
5S + 14 = 44
$$
$$
5S = 30
$$
$$
S = 6
$$

So, each triplet is **6 years old**.

Now find the age of the twins:

$$
T = S + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

One of the twins is **13 years old**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Convert all times to minutes
- **Math homework**: 20 minutes  
- **Reading homework**: 40 minutes  
- **History homework**: 20 minutes  
- **Time before dinner**: 3 hours = 3 × 60 = **180 minutes**

### Step 2: Add up the total time John spends on homework
$$
20 \text{ (math)} + 40 \text{ (reading)} + 20 \text{ (history)} = 80 \text{ minutes}
$$

### Step 3: Subtract homework time from the total time before dinner
$$
180 \text{ minutes (before dinner)} - 80 \text{ minutes (homework)} = 100 \text{ minutes}
$$

### Final Answer:
John has **100 minutes** to nap.
We are given:

- Manolo bought **5 lollipops** and **4 candies** for a total of **$3.20**.
- Each **lollipop costs $0.40**.

We need to find the cost of **10 lollipops and 10 candies**.

---

### Step 1: Find the cost of 5 lollipops
Each lollipop is $0.40, so:

$$
5 \times 0.40 = 2.00
$$

So, the 5 lollipops cost **$2.00**.

---

### Step 2: Find the cost of 4 candies
Total cost of 5 lollipops + 4 candies = $3.20  
So, the 4 candies must cost:

$$
3.20 - 2.00 = 1.20
$$

So, the 4 candies cost **$1.20**.

---

### Step 3: Find the cost of 1 candy
$$
\frac{1.20}{4} = 0.30
$$

So, each candy costs **$0.30**.

---

### Step 4: Find the cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies

- 10 lollipops:  
  $$
  10 \times 0.40 = 4.00
  $$

- 10 candies:  
  $$
  10 \times 0.30 = 3.00
  $$

Add them together:

$$
4.00 + 3.00 = 7.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**$7.00**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the savings rates**

- **Rong saves 20 coins per month.**
- **Neil saves 2/5 times more coins than Rong per month.**

We need to interpret "2/5 times more" correctly.

If Rong saves 20 coins, then:

- **2/5 of Rong's savings = (2/5) × 20 = 8 coins**
- So Neil saves **20 + 8 = 28 coins per month**.

So:
- Rong: 20 coins/month
- Neil: 28 coins/month

---

### **Step 2: Total coins saved per month by both**

- Rong + Neil = 20 + 28 = **48 coins/month**

---

### **Step 3: How many months in 10 years?**

- 10 years × 12 months/year = **120 months**

---

### **Step 4: Total coins saved in 10 years**

- Total coins = 48 coins/month × 120 months = **5,760 coins**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

**They have 5,760 coins ten years after they started saving.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the costs**

- The dog needs **2 vaccines**, each costing **$20**.
  - So, total vaccine cost = $ 2 \times 20 = 40 $ dollars.

- The **heartworm check** is **60% of the total bill**.

So, if we let the **total bill** be **T**, then:

$$
\text{Heartworm check} = 0.6T
$$

And the **vaccines** make up the rest of the bill:

$$
\text{Vaccine cost} = T - 0.6T = 0.4T
$$

We already know the vaccine cost is $40, so:

$$
0.4T = 40
$$

---

### **Step 2: Solve for total bill (T)**

$$
T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100
$$

So, the **total bill is $100**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how much John leaves with**

John brings **$125** with him.

He spends **$100**, so the amount he leaves with is:

$$
125 - 100 = 25
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: John leaves with $25.**
We are given the composition of a crate and the relative prices of the individual fruits. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the price of one banana

Let the price of **one banana** be:

$$
B = x
$$

Then, according to the problem:

- One **apple** costs $0.50.
- One **banana** costs **twice as much** as an apple:
  $$
  B = 2 \times 0.50 = 1.00
  $$

So, **one banana costs $1.00**.

---

### Step 2: Find the price of one orange

Oranges cost **three times as much as a banana**:

$$
O = 3 \times B = 3 \times 1.00 = 3.00
$$

So, **one orange costs $3.00**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the crate

A crate contains:

- 5 bananas
- 12 apples
- 7 oranges

Now compute the cost of each type:

- 5 bananas:  
  $$
  5 \times 1.00 = 5.00
  $$

- 12 apples:  
  $$
  12 \times 0.50 = 6.00
  $$

- 7 oranges:  
  $$
  7 \times 3.00 = 21.00
  $$

---

### Step 4: Add up all the costs

$$
\text{Total cost} = 5.00 + 6.00 + 21.00 = 32.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{32}
$$

The price for such a crate of fruit is **$32.00**.
We are told that Brittany's quilted comforter is made up of **1-foot by 1-foot colored squares**, and we are given the number of each color:

- **Red squares**: 14  
- **Blue squares**: 4 more than red  
- **Green squares**: 6 more than blue  
- **White squares**: 12 fewer than green  

We need to find the **total number of square feet** of the comforter. Since each square is **1 foot by 1 foot**, the **area in square feet** is equal to the **number of squares**.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of blue squares

> Blue squares = Red squares + 4  
> Blue squares = 14 + 4 = **18**

---

### Step 2: Find the number of green squares

> Green squares = Blue squares + 6  
> Green squares = 18 + 6 = **24**

---

### Step 3: Find the number of white squares

> White squares = Green squares - 12  
> White squares = 24 - 12 = **12**

---

### Step 4: Add all the squares together

- Red: 14  
- Blue: 18  
- Green: 24  
- White: 12  

Total number of squares =  
$$
14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68
$$

Since each square is 1 square foot, the total area of the comforter is:

$$
\boxed{68} \text{ square feet}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the total number of people**

There are:

- **42 adults**
- **15 babies**

So, the **total number of people** is:

$$
42 + 15 = 57 \text{ people}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Understand the chair information**

The restaurant has:

- **8 high chairs**
- **5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs**

So, the number of **regular chairs** is:

$$
5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ regular chairs}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total number of chairs available**

Total chairs = regular chairs + high chairs

$$
40 + 8 = 48 \text{ chairs}
$$

---

### **Step 4: How many more chairs are needed**

We need enough chairs for **57 people**, but there are only **48 chairs**.

So, the number of additional chairs needed is:

$$
57 - 48 = 9
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: She needs to get 9 more chairs.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Total number of deer
We are told there are **50 deer** in the field.

---

### Step 2: Number of bucks
We are told that **50% of the deer are bucks**.

$$
\text{Number of bucks} = 50\% \times 50 = 0.5 \times 50 = 25
$$

So, there are **25 bucks**.

---

### Step 3: Number of bucks with 8 points
We are told that **20% of the bucks are 8 points**.

$$
\text{Number of 8-point bucks} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.2 \times 25 = 5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{5}
$$

There are **5 eight-point bucks** in the field.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given:

- **Adam** has **50 points**.
- **Betty** has **30% more** points than Adam.
- **Tom** has **30 points less** than Betty.
- **Marta** has **3 times more** points than Tom.
- The class needs **at least 400 points** to go on a trip.
- We need to find **how many points the class is missing** (i.e., how far they are from 400).

---

### Step 1: Find Betty's points

Betty has **30% more** points than Adam, who has 50 points.

$$
\text{Betty's points} = 50 + (30\% \times 50) = 50 + 15 = 65
$$

So, **Betty = 65 points**

---

### Step 2: Find Tom's points

Tom has **30 points less** than Betty.

$$
\text{Tom's points} = 65 - 30 = 35
$$

So, **Tom = 35 points**

---

### Step 3: Find Marta's points

Marta has **3 times more** points than Tom.

$$
\text{Marta's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
$$

So, **Marta = 105 points**

---

### Step 4: Add up all the points

Now we add up all the students' points:

- Adam: 50  
- Betty: 65  
- Tom: 35  
- Marta: 105  

$$
\text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
$$

---

### Step 5: Find how many points they are missing

The class needs **400 points** to go on the trip. They currently have **255 points**.

$$
\text{Points missing} = 400 - 255 = 145
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**The class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many **great grand-babies** will be at the family reunion.

---

### Step 1: Great Grandma Jones

- She has **3 children**.
  
---

### Step 2: Her Children (Grandchildren of Great Grandma Jones)

- Each of her **3 children** has **3 children of their own**.
- So, total **grandchildren** = 3 children × 3 = **9 grandchildren**.

---

### Step 3: Her Grandchildren (Great Grandchildren of Great Grandma Jones)

- Each of the **9 grandchildren** has **3 babies of their own**.
- So, total **great grand-babies** = 9 grandchildren × 3 = **27 great grand-babies**.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{27}
$$

So, **27 great grand-babies** will be there for Great Grandma Jones to kiss.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Greta’s total paycheck:**  
   $2400.00

2. **She puts 50% into her retirement account:**  
   $$
   50\% \text{ of } 2400 = 0.50 \times 2400 = 1200
   $$

3. **She uses 20% of her paycheck for her car payment:**  
   $$
   20\% \text{ of } 2400 = 0.20 \times 2400 = 480
   $$

4. **Total money spent on retirement and car payment:**  
   $$
   1200 + 480 = 1680
   $$

5. **Money left to spend:**  
   $$
   2400 - 1680 = 720
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$720.00** is left for Greta to spend.
We are given:

- The box can hold **20 pencils**.
- **4 pencils are missing** from the box.
- We are asked: **How many pairs of pencils are in the box?**

---

### Step 1: Determine how many pencils are currently in the box

If the box was full (20 pencils), and 4 are missing, then:

$$
\text{Pencils in the box} = 20 - 4 = 16
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate how many **pairs** of pencils are in the box

A **pair** is a group of **2 pencils**.

So, to find the number of pairs:

$$
\text{Number of pairs} = \frac{\text{Total pencils in box}}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{8}
$$

There are **8 pairs of pencils** in the box.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many fireworks Hannah will see in total.

---

### Step 1: Fireworks in the city display

The city is setting off **15 boxes of 20 fireworks each**.

$$
15 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ fireworks per box} = 300 \text{ fireworks}
$$

Hannah can see **40%** of these fireworks.

$$
40\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.4 \times 300 = 120 \text{ fireworks}
$$

So, Hannah sees **120 fireworks** from the city display.

---

### Step 2: Fireworks in Hannah's backyard

Hannah also sets off **3 boxes of 5 fireworks each**.

$$
3 \text{ boxes} \times 5 \text{ fireworks per box} = 15 \text{ fireworks}
$$

These are all fireworks that Hannah will **see**, since they're in her backyard.

---

### Step 3: Total fireworks Hannah will see

Add the fireworks she sees from the city and the ones in her backyard:

$$
120 \text{ (from city)} + 15 \text{ (from backyard)} = 135 \text{ fireworks}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**135 fireworks** in total.
We are given the following information:

- Aiden and **12 of his friends** = **13 people**
- They meet up with **7 more friends** = **7 more people**
- So, total number of people = 13 + 7 = **20 people**

Each person **saves a seat**, so there are **20 seats**.

Each seat has:
- **1 person**
- **2 drinks**
- **3 snacks**

Each **drink costs $2**, and each **snack costs $2**.

So, per seat:
- Drinks: 2 × $2 = **$4**
- Snacks: 3 × $2 = **$6**
- Total per seat: $4 + $6 = **$10**

Now, multiply by the number of seats (which is equal to the number of people, 20):

$$
20 \text{ seats} \times \$10/\text{seat} = \$200
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **\$200**
We are given the following information:

- **Gissela's truck** can haul **4,000 pounds** of gravel.
- **Gordy's truck** can haul **800 pounds more** than Gissela's.
- When **Gary's truck** joins Gissela and Gordy, the **total capacity** of all three trucks is **11,600 pounds**.

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find Gordy's truck capacity

Gordy's truck can carry **800 pounds more** than Gissela's.

$$
\text{Gordy's capacity} = 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 2: Let Gary's truck capacity be $ x $

We are told that when **all three trucks** (Gissela, Gordy, and Gary) are used together, they can haul a total of **11,600 pounds**.

So:

$$
\text{Total capacity} = \text{Gissela} + \text{Gordy} + \text{Gary}
$$
$$
11,600 = 4,000 + 4,800 + x
$$

Now add the known values:

$$
11,600 = 8,800 + x
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
x = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{2,800} \text{ pounds}
$$

So, **Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.**
We are told:

- There are **8 males**, including **Larry**.
- There are **6 females**.
- Each **male ate 1 more dumpling than each female**.
- Each **female ate 3 dumplings**.
- No leftovers, so the total number of dumplings is exactly the number eaten by everyone.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many dumplings each person ate

- Each **female** ate **3 dumplings**.
- Each **male** ate **1 more** than a female →  
  $$
  \text{Male's dumplings} = 3 + 1 = 4
  $$

---

### Step 2: Calculate total dumplings eaten by all people

- Number of **males** = 8 → Total dumplings eaten by males =  
  $$
  8 \times 4 = 32
  $$
- Number of **females** = 6 → Total dumplings eaten by females =  
  $$
  6 \times 3 = 18
  $$

---

### Step 3: Add to find total dumplings cooked

$$
\text{Total dumplings} = 32 + 18 = \boxed{50}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{50}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the ratio
Gerald and Julia divided **$100 in the ratio 3:2**.

This means:
- Gerald gets **3 parts**
- Julia gets **2 parts**

Total parts = 3 + 2 = **5 parts**

### Step 2: Find the value of one part
Since the total amount is $100, and it's divided into 5 parts:

$$
\text{Value of 1 part} = \frac{100}{5} = 20
$$

### Step 3: Find how much Gerald had initially
Gerald gets 3 parts:

$$
\text{Gerald's share} = 3 \times 20 = 60
$$

### Step 4: Gerald spent $10 on a book
So, the money he has left is:

$$
60 - 10 = 50
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Gerald had $50 left.**
We are told:

- Martha's **cat** is **5 times faster** than her **turtle**.
- The **cat** runs at **15 feet per second**.
- We need to find how far the **turtle** can crawl in **40 seconds**.

---

### Step 1: Find the turtle's speed

Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, that means:

$$
\text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ feet per second}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate how far the turtle crawls in 40 seconds

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 3 \text{ ft/s} \times 40 \text{ s} = 120 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{120} \text{ feet}
$$
We are told:

- The **goal** is to raise **$6300**.
- After **3 hours**, they have raised **$2100**.
- They raise **an equal amount each hour**.

---

### Step 1: Find the rate of fundraising per hour

They raised $2100 in 3 hours, so the amount raised per hour is:

$$
\frac{2100}{3} = 700 \text{ dollars per hour}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how much more money they need to raise

They have already raised $2100, and their goal is $6300. So the remaining amount needed is:

$$
6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find how many more hours they need to raise $4200 at $700 per hour

$$
\frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Final Answer:

They need to fundraise for a total of:

$$
3 + 6 = \boxed{9} \text{ hours}
$$

So, they need **9 hours** in total to reach their goal.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the total water from the Colorado River

We are told that **Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River**.

So, if the total water from the river is 100%, then:

- **City uses: 40%**

---

### Step 2: Determine how much of that 40% is used for industrial purposes

We are told that **80% of the water used by the city is for industrial purposes**.

So, out of the 40% that the city uses:

- **Industrial use = 80% of 40%**
  
Let’s calculate that:

$$
80\% \times 40\% = 0.8 \times 0.4 = 0.32 = 32\%
$$

So, **32% of the river's total water is used by the city for industrial purposes**.

---

### Step 3: Find the percentage used for non-industrial purposes

Since the city uses 40% in total, and 32% is used for industrial purposes, the remaining must be for **non-industrial purposes**.

$$
40\% - 32\% = 18\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**18% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.**
Sure! Let's break this down step by step.

- **A week has 7 days.**

### Step 1: Find the number of days in 2 weeks
$$
2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days}
$$

### Step 2: Multiply the number of days by the daily rate
$$
14 \text{ days} \times \$12/\text{day} = \$168
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.**
We are given:

- The factory makes **100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours**.
- It can make **50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours**.
- We need to find out how many **quarts in total** would be made in **48 hours**.

---

### Step 1: Find the rate of production for each type of ice cream

#### Chocolate Ice Cream:
- Makes 100 quarts in 2 hours.
- Rate = $ \frac{100 \text{ quarts}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ quarts/hour} $

#### Vanilla Ice Cream:
- Makes 50 quarts in 4 hours.
- Rate = $ \frac{50 \text{ quarts}}{4 \text{ hours}} = 12.5 \text{ quarts/hour} $

---

### Step 2: Total production rate (both types combined)

$$
\text{Total rate} = 50 + 12.5 = 62.5 \text{ quarts/hour}
$$

---

### Step 3: Multiply by 48 hours to get total production

$$
\text{Total quarts in 48 hours} = 62.5 \times 48 = 3000 \text{ quarts}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**3000 quarts** of ice cream would be made in 48 hours.
Let's calculate Marcus' total bill step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the cost of each item type**

- **Croissants**:  
  5 croissants × $3.00 each = **$15.00**

- **Cinnamon rolls**:  
  4 cinnamon rolls × $2.50 each = **$10.00**

- **Mini quiches**:  
  3 mini quiches × $4.00 each = **$12.00**

- **Blueberry muffins**:  
  13 muffins × $1.00 each = **$13.00**

---

### **Step 2: Add up all the costs before discount**

$$
\$15.00 + \$10.00 + \$12.00 + \$13.00 = \$50.00
$$

---

### **Step 3: Apply the 10% loyalty card discount**

10% of $50.00 is:

$$
0.10 \times 50.00 = \$5.00
$$

So, the **discounted total** is:

$$
\$50.00 - \$5.00 = \$45.00
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**Marcus' total bill is $45.00.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Problem Summary:
- **Deal:** Buy 2 scoops, get 1 free.
- **Cost per scoop:** $1.50
- **Total money Erin has:** $6.00
- **Goal:** How many scoops can she get?

---

### Step 1: Understand the deal

The deal is: **Buy 2 scoops, get 1 free.**  
So for every **3 scoops**, she pays for **2**.

That means the **cost per 3 scoops** is:

$$
2 \text{ scoops} \times \$1.50 = \$3.00
$$

So, for **\$3.00**, she gets **3 scoops**.

---

### Step 2: How many sets of 3 scoops can she buy with \$6.00?

$$

Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the problem**

- Both Ginger and Amy start with **100 pieces of candy**.
- Ginger eats **4 pieces per day**.
- Amy eats **3 pieces per day**.
- We are to find how much **more candy Amy has than Ginger** after **two weeks**.

---

### **Step 2: Convert two weeks into days**

- 1 week = 7 days  
- 2 weeks = 2 × 7 = **14 days**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how much candy each person eats in 14 days**

We are given the following information about Helga's clog dancing:

- **Normal tapping (arms down):**
  - Right foot: **300 taps per minute**
  - Left foot: **250 taps per minute**
  
- **When arms are raised:**
  - Both feet tap at **200 taps per minute**

- **Dancing duration:** 5 minutes
- **Arms raised for 2 minutes** → so **arms down for 3 minutes**

We are to find the **combined total number of times she taps both feet** during the entire 5-minute dance.

---

### Step 1: Calculate taps when arms are down (3 minutes)

- Right foot: $ 300 \text{ taps/min} \times 3 \text{ min} = 900 $ taps
- Left foot: $ 250 \text{ taps/min} \times 3 \text{ min} = 750 $ taps

Total taps when arms are down:
$$
900 + 750 = 1650 \text{ taps}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate taps when arms are raised (2 minutes)

- Each foot taps at 200 taps per minute, so **both feet together** tap:
$$
200 + 200 = 400 \text{ taps per minute}
$$

Over 2 minutes:
$$
400 \text{ taps/min} \times 2 \text{ min} = 800 \text{ taps}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add both parts together

We are told that **Bryce and four of his friends** each ordered their own pizza. That makes a total of **5 people**, each with a **12-slice pizza**.

So, total number of pizza slices:

$$
5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ slices}
$$

Now, we're told:

- **Bryce and two friends** ate **2/3** of their pizzas.
- The **two remaining friends** ate **¾** of their pizzas.

Let’s break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: How many people are in each group?

- **Group A**: Bryce + 2 friends = **3 people**
- **Group B**: 2 remaining friends = **2 people**

---

### Step 2: How much did Group A eat?

Each person in Group A ate **2/3** of their pizza.

Each pizza has 12 slices, so:

$$
\frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices per person}
$$

So, for 3 people:

$$
3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices eaten by Group A}
$$

---

### Step 3: How much did Group B eat?

Each person in Group B ate **¾** of their pizza.

$$
\frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices per person}
$$

For 2 people:

$$
2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices eaten by Group B}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total slices eaten

$$
24 + 18 = 42 \text{ slices eaten}
$$

---

### Step 5: Slices left

Total slices = 60  
Slices eaten = 42  
Slices left = 

$$
60 - 42 = \boxed{18}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **18 slices of pizza were left.**
We are given:

- A **cat** eats **9 sausages in 30 minutes**.
- A **dog** eats the same number of sausages (**9 sausages**) in **2/3 the time** it takes the cat.

We are to find the **average time** the two animals take to eat **9 sausages**.

---

### Step 1: Find the time the dog takes

The cat takes **30 minutes** to eat 9 sausages.

The dog takes **2/3 of that time**:

$$
\text{Dog's time} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the average time

Now we have:

- Cat: 30 minutes
- Dog: 20 minutes

To find the **average time**, we add the two times and divide by 2:

$$
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{25} \text{ minutes}
$$
We are given the following:

- Topher's shoe length = **8 feet 4 inches**
- Topher's shoe is **10 inches longer than 9 times** the length of Bobby's shoe.

We need to find the **length of Bobby's shoe in inches**.

---

### Step 1: Convert Topher's shoe length to inches

We know:
- 1 foot = 12 inches
- 8 feet = 8 × 12 = **96 inches**
- 4 inches = **4 inches**

So, Topher's shoe length in inches is:

$$
96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 2: Set up the equation

Let $ x $ be the length of Bobby's shoe in inches.

According to the problem:

$$
\text{Topher's shoe} = 9x + 10
$$

We already found that Topher's shoe is **100 inches**, so:

$$
9x + 10 = 100
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

Subtract 10 from both sides:

$$
9x = 90
$$

Divide both sides by 9:

$$
x = 10
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{10} \text{ inches}
$$

So, one of Bobby’s shoes is **10 inches long**.

  32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows}
  $$

Hannah smashes **three quarters** of these:
$$
\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total number of windows Hannah smashes**

Add the windows from students and teachers:
$$
64 \text{ (students)} + 48 \text{ (teachers)} = \boxed{112} \text{ windows}
$$

$$
\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
$$

Number of people **remaining** after midday:  
$$
5000 - 2000 = 3000
$$

---

### Step 2: Number of people who voted by 16:00

By 16:00, **2/3 of the remaining people** (from the 3000) had voted.

So, number of people who voted between midday and 16:00:  
$$
\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
$$

---

### Step 3: Total number of people who had voted by 16:00

People who voted by midday: 2000  
People who voted between midday and 16:00: 2000  
Total:

We are given:

- Total number of voters = 100
- Candidate A got **20%** of the votes.
- Candidate B got **50% more** than candidate A.
- The rest of the votes went to candidate C.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of votes for candidate A

Candidate A got 20% of 100 votes:

$$
\text{Votes for A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the number of votes for candidate B

Candidate B got **50% more** than candidate A.

So, 50% of A's votes is:

  Each uses **4 ounces**, and he makes **3** of them.  
  $$
  3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ ounces}
  $$

- **Medium cubes**:  
  Each uses **2 ounces**, and he makes **7** of them.  
  $$
  7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ ounces}
  $$

- **Small cubes**:  
  Each uses **0.5 ounces**, and he makes **8** of them.  
  $$
  8 \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ ounces}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Add up the total water used**

$$
12 + 14 + 4 = 30 \text{ ounces}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Subtract from the total water to find how much is left**

$$
32 - 30 = 2 \text{ ounces}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 2 ounces of water are left.**
We are given the following information:

- **Clara has 20 books.**
- **Clara has two times as many books as Steven.**
- **Alice has 6 more books than Steven.**

We need to find: **How many more books does Clara have than Alice?**

---

### Step 1: Find how many books Steven has.

We are told:
> Clara has **two times** as many books as Steven, and Clara has **20 books**.

Let’s call the number of books Steven has = **S**.

Then:
$$
2S = 20 \Rightarrow S = 10
$$

So, **Steven has 10 books**.

---

### Step 2: Find how many books Alice has.

We are told:
> Alice has **6 more books** than Steven.

So:
$$
\text{Alice's books} = S + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16
$$

So, **Alice has 16 books**.

---

### Step 3: Find how many more books Clara has than Alice.

Clara has 20 books, Alice has 16 books.

$$
20 - 16 = 4
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Clara has 4 more books than Alice.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information

- A **gallon jar** costs **$5**.
- A **gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar**.
- We are to calculate the **total amount of money** Cecelia spent on:
  - **10 gallon jars**
  - **16 half-gallon jars**

---

### Step 2: Find the cost of a half-gallon jar

We know:

$$
\text{Cost of a gallon jar} = \text{Cost of a half-gallon jar} + 2
$$

Given that a gallon jar costs **$5**, we can solve for the cost of a half-gallon jar:

$$
5 = \text{Cost of half-gallon jar} + 2
$$

$$
\text{Cost of half-gallon jar} = 5 - 2 = 3
$$

So, a **half-gallon jar costs $3**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate total cost for 10 gallon jars

$$
10 \text{ gallon jars} \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Calculate total cost for 16 half-gallon jars

$$
16 \text{ half-gallon jars} \times 3 = 48 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 5: Add both amounts to get the total

$$
50 + 48 = 98
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Cecelia spent a total of $98.**
We are given the following information about a class of **50 students** and their hobbies:

- **10 students** like to **bake**.
- **5 students** like to **play basketball**.
- The rest like to either **play video games or play music**.
- The number that like to **play music** is **twice** the number that prefer **playing basketball**.

---

### Step 1: Total number of students = 50

We are told:
- 10 students like baking
- 5 students like basketball
- The rest like either video games or music

So, first, let's find how many students like **video games or music**.

$$
\text{Students who like video games or music} = 50 - (10 + 5) = 50 - 15 = 35
$$

---

### Step 2: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ B = $ number of students who like **basketball** = 5  
- $ M = $ number of students who like **music**  
- $ V = $ number of students who like **video games**

From the problem:
$$
M = 2B = 2 \times 5 = 10
$$

So, **10 students like music**.

Now we know:
- Music: 10 students  
- Video games: ?

We also know that the total number of students who like **video games or music** is 35.

So:
$$
V + M = 35 \\
V + 10 = 35 \\
V = 35 - 10 = 25
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{25}
$$

**25 students like to play video games.**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Initial number of birds

Jeremy saw **12 birds** in the backyard.

---

### Step 2: Birds scared away

He threw a stone, and **1/3 of that number** were scared away.

So:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ birds}
$$

These 4 birds were scared away.

---

### Step 3: Remaining birds after the scare

$$
12 - 4 = 8 \text{ birds remaining}
$$

---

### Step 4: More birds join

A few minutes later, **20 more birds** joined the remaining 8 birds.

$$
8 + 20 = 28 \text{ birds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{28}
$$

There are now **28 birds** in the backyard.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of students**

We are told that **two classes have a total of 80 students**.

So, the total number of students is:

$$
\text{Total students} = 80
$$

---

### **Step 2: Number of students in each class**

Since the two classes have the **same number of students**, we divide the total by 2:

$$
\text{Students per class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
$$

So, **each class has 40 students**.

---

### **Step 3: Percentage of girls in each class**

We are told that **40% of the students in each class are girls**.

So, the number of girls in one class is:

$$
\text{Girls in one class} = 40\% \times 40 = 0.4 \times 40 = 16
$$

---

### **Step 4: Number of boys in one class**

Since there are 40 students in a class and 16 are girls, the number of boys is:

$$
\text{Boys in one class} = 40 - 16 = 24
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{24}
$$

There are **24 boys in each class**.
Let's go through the problem step by step to find out how many cake slices remained on the plate.

---

### Step 1: Initial number of slices
The plate already had **2 slices**.

$$
\text{Current slices} = 2
$$

---

### Step 2: Mara adds 3 slices
Mara adds 3 more slices to the plate.

$$
2 + 3 = 5 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### Step 3: Mara triples the number of slices she currently has
She **triples** the number of slices she has now (which is 5).

$$
5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### Step 4: Mara eats 2 slices
She eats 2 slices from the plate.

$$
15 - 2 = 13 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### Step 5: Her friend steals 5 slices
Her friend steals 5 slices from the plate.

$$
13 - 5 = 8 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{8}
$$

**So, 8 cake slices remained on the plate.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Count the total number of animals
Melissa has:
- 8 dogs  
- 5 cats  
- 3 birds  
- 12 horses  

Add them all together:

$$
8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28 \text{ animals}
$$

### Step 2: Divide the total number of animals by 7 (days in a week)

$$
28 \div 7 = 4
$$

### Final Answer:
Melissa will groom **4 animals each day of the week**.
Let's break this down step by step to find Mark's **profit**.

---

### **Step 1: Cost of the packs**
Mark buys **3 packs** at **$1800 each**.

$$
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = \$5400
$$

---

### **Step 2: Value of the cards he opened**

He opened the packs and found:

- **1 card worth $4000**
- **1 card worth $1000**
- **30 more cards**, each worth **$50 on average**

So, the total value of the cards is:

$$
\text{Value of valuable cards} = 4000 + 1000 = 5000
$$

$$
\text{Value of other cards} = 30 \times 50 = 1500
$$

$$
\text{Total value of all cards} = 5000 + 1500 = \$6500
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate profit**

Profit is calculated as:

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Total value of cards} - \text{Cost of packs}
$$

$$
\text{Profit} = 6500 - 5400 = \$1100
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$1100}
$$

Mark made a **profit of $1100**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total cost at the first amusement park**

- **Adult fee**: $26 per adult  
- **Child fee**: $12 per child  
- There are **2 adults** and **2 children**

So, the total cost at the first park is:

$$
(2 \times 26) + (2 \times 12) = 52 + 24 = 76
$$

**Total cost at Park 1 = $76**

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the total cost at the second amusement park**

- **Adult fee**: $14 per adult  
- **Child fee**: $10 per child  

Again, 2 adults and 2 children:

$$
(2 \times 14) + (2 \times 10) = 28 + 20 = 48
$$

**Total cost at Park 2 = $48**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the savings by choosing the second park**

$$
\text{Savings} = \text{Cost at Park 1} - \text{Cost at Park 2} = 76 - 48 = 28
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: They will save $28** by choosing the second amusement park.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much the tomato vendor saves each week.

---

### **Step 1: Find the daily cost difference**

- **Old price per tomato:** $0.50  
- **New price per tomato:** $0.40  

**Savings per tomato = $0.50 - $0.40 = $0.10**

---

### **Step 2: Find the weekly savings**

- **Tomatoes sold per day:** 500  
- **Savings per day = 500 × $0.10 = $50**  
- **Savings per week = $50 × 7 = $350**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
The vendor saves **$350 per week**.
We are given the following information:

- **Sean has 56 marbles.**
- **Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean.**
- **Sean has half as many marbles as Cal.**

We are asked to find:  
**How many marbles do Carl and Cal have combined?**

---

### Step 1: Find how many marbles Carl has

Carl has **four times** as many marbles as Sean.

$$
\text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many marbles Cal has

Sean has **half as many marbles as Cal**, so:

$$
\text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles}
$$

Solving for Cal's marbles:

$$
\text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 2 \times 56 = 112
$$

---

### Step 3: Add Carl’s and Cal’s marbles together

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{336}
$$
We are given:

- There are **54 students**.
- The activity requires **12 groups** of **equal size**.
- We need to determine how many **more groups** are needed to form.

---

### Step 1: Determine the size of each group

Since there are **54 students** and they are to be divided into **12 groups** of equal size, we divide:

$$
\frac{54}{12} = 4.5
$$

This means that **each group would have 4.5 students**, which is **not possible** because you can't have half a student in a group.

So, we must adjust the number of groups to make the group size an **integer**.

---

### Step 2: Find the largest number of groups that divides 54 evenly

We need to find the **largest divisor of 54** that is **less than or equal to 12** (since the activity already requires 12 groups).

The divisors of 54 are:

$$
1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54
$$

From these, the ones less than or equal to 12 are:

$$
1, 2, 3, 6, 9
$$

The **largest** such number is **9**.

So, if we form **9 groups**, each group will have:

$$
\frac{54}{9} = 6 \text{ students}
$$

That’s a valid, whole number.

---

### Step 3: How many more groups are needed?

The activity requires **12 groups**, but we can only form **9 groups** with equal sizes.

So, the number of **additional groups** needed is:

$$
12 - 9 = 3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{3}
$$

So, **3 more groups** are needed to form.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the rental pattern**

- **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):**  
  60 chairs are rented each day.

- **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):**  
  100 chairs are rented each day.

So, in one **week**, Candy rents:

- 5 weekdays × 60 chairs/day = **300 chairs**
- 2 weekend days × 100 chairs/day = **200 chairs**

Total per week = 300 + 200 = **500 chairs**

---

### **Step 2: Total for two 4-week months**

Each month is assumed to be **4 weeks**, so:

- 2 months × 4 weeks/month = **8 weeks**

Total chairs rented in 8 weeks = 8 × 500 = **4000 chairs**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 4000 chairs**
Let's go through the problem step by step and calculate how many bananas Gunther had in total at the end.

---

### **Day 1:**
- Gunther starts with **48 bananas** hidden under a fern branch.
- Arnold steals **half** of them:
  $$
  \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
  $$
- So, Gunther is left with:
  $$
  48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas}
  $$

---

### **Day 2:**
- The next day, Gunther **adds 25 more bananas** to his pile:
  $$
  24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
  $$
- Later that evening, Arnold steals **12 bananas**:
  $$
  49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
  $$

---

### **Day 3:**
- On the third day, Gunther adds **6 more bananas**:
  $$
  37 + 6 = 43 \text{ bananas}
  $$
- Then he **begins counting** the bananas in the pile.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{43}
$$

So, **Gunther found 43 bananas in the pile.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Monthly electricity bill**: $100  
2. **Number of roommates**: 4  
3. **How much does each roommate pay per month?**  
   $$
   \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ dollars per month}
   $$

4. **How many months in a year?**  
   $$
   12 \text{ months}
   $$

5. **How much does each roommate pay per year?**  
   $$
   25 \times 12 = 300 \text{ dollars per year}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
Each roommate will pay **$300 per year** for electricity.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the total number of glasses and plates sent**

- **Glasses:**  
  Jeff sent **8 dozen glasses**.  
  Since 1 dozen = 12, then:  
  $ 8 \times 12 = 96 $ glasses

- **Plates:**  
  Jeff sent **4 dozen plates**.  
  $ 4 \times 12 = 48 $ plates

So, he sent a total of:
- **96 glasses**
- **48 plates**

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many were broken**

- **Broken glasses:** 10
- **Broken plates:** 6

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of glasses and plates**

- **Remaining glasses:**  
  $ 96 - 10 = 86 $ glasses

- **Remaining plates:**  
  $ 48 - 6 = 42 $ plates

---

### **Final Answer:**

Jeff now has **86 glasses** and **42 plates**.

$$
\boxed{86 \text{ glasses and } 42 \text{ plates}}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Initial Setup:**

- **Lorraine starts with:**
  - 30 **small stickers**
  - 40 **large stickers**

---

### **Step 1: Trade 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.**

- She has 30 small stickers.
- 90% of 30 = $ 0.9 \times 30 = 27 $ small stickers
- So she trades **27 small stickers** for **27 large buttons** (since each small sticker is worth 1 small button, and 3 small buttons = 1 large button).

So now:
- Small stickers left: $ 30 - 27 = 3 $
- Large buttons gained: 27

---

### **Step 2: Trade 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.**

- She has 40 large stickers.
- 50% of 40 = $ 0.5 \times 40 = 20 $ large stickers
- Each large sticker is worth 1 large button.

So she trades **20 large stickers** for **20 large buttons**.

Now:
- Large stickers left: $ 40 - 20 = 20 $
- Large buttons gained: 20 (from the trade)
- From Step 1: already had 27 large buttons

So total large buttons now: $ 27 + 20 = 47 $

---

### **Step 3: Trade the rest of her large stickers for small buttons.**

- She has 20 large stickers left.
- Each large sticker is worth **3 small stickers**, so:
  - $ 20 \times 3 = 60 $ small stickers

So she trades **20 large stickers** for **60 small stickers**.

Now:
- Small stickers: $ 3 (from earlier) + 60 = 63 $
- Large buttons: 47 (from before)

---

### **Final Count:**

- **Small stickers:** 63
- **Large buttons:** 47

But the question asks: **How many buttons does she have by the end?**

We need to convert all items into **buttons**:

- **Small stickers:** Each small sticker is worth **1 small button** → 63 small stickers = 63 small buttons
- **Large buttons:** Already in button form → 47 large buttons

So total buttons = 63 (small) + 47 (large) = **110 buttons**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 110 buttons**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are told:

- Joey played **2 matches on Monday**.
- He played **1 match on Friday**.
- On **Saturday**, he played **double the number of matches he played on Monday**.

### Step 1: Matches on Monday
Joey played **2 matches on Monday**.

### Step 2: Matches on Saturday
He played **double the number of matches on Monday**, so:
$$
2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ matches on Saturday}
$$

### Step 3: Matches on Friday
He played **1 match on Friday**.

### Step 4: Total matches in one week
Now, add up all the matches:
$$
\text{Monday: } 2 \\
\text{Friday: } 1 \\
\text{Saturday: } 4 \\
\text{Total: } 2 + 1 + 4 = \boxed{7}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Joey played **7 matches in one week**.
We are told:

- The council has **33 people**.
- The vote **passed** with **twice as many votes in favor** as there were **against**.
- We need to find the **number of votes in favor**.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ x $ = number of votes **against** the regulation
- Then, $ 2x $ = number of votes **in favor** (since it's twice as many)

---

### Step 2: Total votes

The total number of people on the council is 33, so:

$$
x + 2x = 33
$$

$$
3x = 33
$$

$$
x = 11
$$

---

### Step 3: Find votes in favor

$$
2x = 2 \times 11 = 22
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{22}
$$

So, **22 votes were in favor** of the new regulation.
Let's break this down step by step.

We are given:

- **Extra-small (XS):** 11 students  
- **Small (S):** Twice as many as extra-small  
- **Medium (M):** Four less than the number of small  
- **Large (L):** Half as many as medium  
- **Extra-large (XL):** Six more than large  

We'll calculate the number of shirts for each size and then add them up.

---

### Step 1: Extra-small (XS)
Given:
$$
\text{XS} = 11
$$

---

### Step 2: Small (S)
Twice as many as XS:
$$
\text{S} = 2 \times \text{XS} = 2 \times 11 = 22
$$

---

### Step 3: Medium (M)
Four less than the number of small:
$$
\text{M} = \text{S} - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18
$$

---

### Step 4: Large (L)
Half as many as medium:
$$
\text{L} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{M} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
$$

---

### Step 5: Extra-large (XL)
Six more than large:
$$
\text{XL} = \text{L} + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15
$$

---

### Step 6: Total Shirts
Now, add all sizes together:

$$
\text{Total} = \text{XS} + \text{S} + \text{M} + \text{L} + \text{XL}
$$
$$
= 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{75}
$$

Krissa ordered **75 shirts** in total.
Sure! Let's solve this step by step.

### Given:

- **Discount** = 5%

---

### Step 1: Calculate the discount amount  
The discount is 5% of the marked price:

$$
\text{Discount} = 5\% \times 140 = 0.05 \times 140 = 7
$$

---

### Step 2: Subtract the discount from the marked price  
$$
\text{Final price after discount} = 140 - 7 = 133
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
You will pay **$133** after the discount.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Number of songs in one playlist
- Each playlist has **300 songs**.

### Step 2: Number of playlists
- John has **20 playlists**.

### Step 3: Total number of songs
- Total songs = Songs per playlist × Number of playlists  
  $$
  300 \text{ songs/playlist} \times 20 \text{ playlists} = 6000 \text{ songs}
  $$

### Step 4: Duration of each song
- Each song is **10 hours long**.

### Step 5: Total duration of all songs
- Total time = Total number of songs × Duration per song  
  $$
  6000 \text{ songs} \times 10 \text{ hours/song} = 60,000 \text{ hours}
  $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{60,\!000} \text{ hours}

Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are told:

- There are **50 people** in total.
- **20% of 50 people** think horse #2 will win.
- **60% of the remaining people** think horse #7 will win.
- The **rest** think horse #12 will win.

---

### Step 1: Find how many people think horse #2 will win

20% of 50 people:

$$
0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ people}
$$

So, **10 people** think horse #2 will win.

---

### Step 2: Find how many people are left after that

Total people = 50  
People who think horse #2 will win = 10  
Remaining people = $ 50 - 10 = 40 $

---

### Step 3: Find how many of the remaining people think horse #7 will win

60% of the remaining 40 people:

$$
0.60 \times 40 = 24 \text{ people}
$$

So, **24 people** think horse #7 will win.

---

### Step 4: Find how many people think horse #12 will win

That’s the rest of the people, so:

$$
50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \text{ people}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{16}
$$

**16 people** think horse #12 will win.
We are given the following information:

1. **Two thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians.**
2. **One third of the Pomeranians are girls.**
3. **There are 6 Pomeranian girls.**

We need to find the **total number of puppies** Jana has.

---

### Step 1: Let the total number of puppies be $ x $.

Then, the number of **Pomeranian puppies** is:

$$
\frac{2}{3}x
$$

---

### Step 2: One third of the Pomeranians are girls.

So, the number of **Pomeranian girls** is:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}x = \frac{2}{9}x
$$

We are told that this equals **6**:

$$
\frac{2}{9}x = 6
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

Multiply both sides by 9:

$$

Let's break this down step by step to find out how much more Jayden needs to buy the camera.

---

### Step 1: Jayden's initial money
Jayden had **$70** from selling pictures.

---

### Step 2: Ava's contribution
Ava has a **$90 allowance**, and she gives **half** of that to Jayden.

So, Ava gives:
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 90 = 45
$$

---

### Step 3: Total money Jayden has now
Jayden's total money is:
$$
70 + 45 = 115
$$

---

### Step 4: Cost of the camera
The camera costs **$200**.

---

### Step 5: How much more Jayden needs
To find out how much more Jayden needs:
$$
200 - 115 = 85
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Jayden needs **$85 more** to buy the camera.
We are given the following:

- There are **three homes**.
- The **total** number of cases of shingles needed is **250**.
- The **first house** needs **1/2 of the second house**.
- The **third house** needs **double the first house**.

Let’s define variables to represent the amount of shingles each house needs:

- Let $ x $ be the amount of shingles for the **first house**.
- Then the **second house** needs $ 2x $ (since it's double the first).
- The **third house** needs $ 2x $ as well (since it's double the first).

Now, we can write the total:

$$
x + 2x + 2x = 250
$$

Simplify:

$$
5x = 250
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
x = \frac{250}{5} = 50
$$

So:

- First house: $ x = 50 $
- Second house: $ 2x = 100 $
- Third house: $ 2x = 100 $

### ✅ Final Answer:
The **third house** will need **100 cases of shingles**.

We are told that **George has 45% more pears than bananas**, and he has **200 bananas**.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of pears

"45% more pears than bananas" means:

$$
\text{Pears} = \text{Bananas} + 45\% \times \text{Bananas}
$$

$$
\text{Pears} = 200 + 0.45 \times 200 = 200 + 90 = 290
$$

So, George has **290 pears**.

---

### Step 2: Add the number of bananas and pears to find total fruits

$$
\text{Total fruits} = \text{Bananas} + \text{Pears} = 200 + 290 = 490
$$

Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**

- **Ezra read twice as many books as Ahmed in one hour.**
- **Ezra has already read 300 books this hour.**
- **Ezra decided to read 150 more books.**

We are asked to find **how many books they have read altogether**.

---

### **Step 2: Find out how many books Ahmed read**

From the problem:

> Ezra read **twice as many books as Ahmed**.

Let’s let the number of books Ahmed read be **x**.

Then, Ezra read **2x** books.

But we’re told that **Ezra has read 300 books**, so:

$$
2x = 300
$$

Solving for x:

$$
x = \frac{300}{2} = 150
$$

So, **Ahmed read 150 books**.

---

### **Step 3: Add the extra books Ezra will read**

Ezra **already read 300 books**, and then **decides to read 150 more**.

So, total books Ezra reads =  
$$
300 + 150 = 450
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add both Ezra and Ahmed's total books**

- Ezra: 450 books  
- Ahmed: 150 books  

Total books read together:

$$
450 + 150 = \boxed{600}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **600 books**
Let's break down Tanya's earnings step by step.

---

### **Monday:**
- **Number of classes:** 4  
- **Hours per day:** 5  
- **Earnings per hour:** $15  
- **Additional payment per day if she teaches more than 3 classes:** $5

Since she teaches **4 classes**, which is **more than 3**, she gets the **additional $5**.

#### Earnings from Monday:
- Hourly earnings: $ 5 \text{ hours} \times 15 = 75 $
- Additional payment: $5

**Total for Monday:**  
$$
75 + 5 = 80
$$

---

### **Wednesday:**
- **Number of classes:** 2  
- **Hours per day:** 2  
- **Earnings per hour:** $15  
- **Additional payment per day if she teaches more than 3 classes:** $5

She only teaches **2 classes**, which is **not more than 3**, so she **does not get the additional $5**.

#### Earnings from Wednesday:
- Hourly earnings: $ 2 \text{ hours} \times 15 = 30 $

**Total for Wednesday:**  
$$
30
$$

---

### **Total Earnings for Both Days:**
$$
80 \text{ (Monday)} + 30 \text{ (Wednesday)} = \boxed{110}
$$

### ✅ **Answer: Tanya earned $110 over the two days.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The company has **4 vanilla scents** and **8 fruity scents**.
- They sell **5 of each of the vanilla scents**.
- They sell **2 of each of the fruity scents**.

So, the total number of **vanilla scents sold** is:
$$
5 \text{ (per scent)} \times 4 \text{ (total vanilla scents)} = 20 \text{ vanilla scents sold}
$$

The total number of **fruity scents sold** is:
$$
2 \text{ (per scent)} \times 8 \text{ (total fruity scents)} = 16 \text{ fruity scents sold}
$$

### Step 2: Find the difference
Now, subtract the number of fruity scents sold from the number of vanilla scents sold:
$$
20 - 16 = 4
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**4 more vanilla scents sold compared with fruity scents.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the money from selling eggplants
Bennet sells **20 eggplants** at **$3 each**:

$$
20 \times 3 = 60
$$

So, he gets **$60** from the eggplants.

---

### Step 2: Let’s define the price per ear of corn
Let the price per ear of corn be **x dollars**.

He has **25 ears of corn**, so the total money from corn is:

$$
25x
$$

---

### Step 3: Total money needed
Bennet wants to make a total of **$135**.

So, we can write the equation:

$$
60 + 25x = 135
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for x

Subtract 60 from both sides:

$$
25x = 135 - 60 = 75
$$

Now divide both sides by 25:

$$
x = \frac{75}{25} = 3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Bennet should sell each ear of corn for **$3**.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total Weekend Time**

Tatiana has:

- **Saturday:** 7 hours  
- **Sunday:** 5 hours  
- **Total weekend time:**  
  $$
  7 + 5 = 12 \text{ hours}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Time Spent Reading**

She reads for **3 hours**.

So, the remaining time is:
$$
12 - 3 = 9 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Time Spent Playing Video Games**

She plays video games for **1/3 of the remaining time** (after reading).

That is:
$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Time Spent Playing Soccer**

Now subtract the time spent on reading and video games from the total weekend time to find how much time she spends playing soccer.

Time spent on soccer:
$$
12 - 3 - 3 = 6 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Percentage of Weekend Spent Playing Soccer**

To find the percentage:
$$
\frac{6}{12} \times 100 = 50\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**50%** of her weekend is spent playing soccer.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Anthony starts with 50 pencils.

He gives **1/2** of his pencils to Brandon.

$$
\text{Pencils given to Brandon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
$$

So, the number of pencils **remaining** after giving to Brandon is:

$$
50 - 25 = 25
$$

---

### Step 2: He then gives **3/5** of the remaining pencils to Charlie.

The remaining pencils are 25. So:

$$
\text{Pencils given to Charlie} = \frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15
$$

Now, the number of pencils **remaining** after giving to Charlie is:

$$
25 - 15 = 10
$$

---

### Step 3: Anthony keeps the remaining pencils.

$$
\text{Pencils Anthony kept} = 10
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Anthony kept 10 pencils.**
We are given the following information:

- Distance to the museum: **150 miles**
- Speed going to the museum: **75 mph**
- Speed returning home: **75 mph** (same speed)
- Time spent at the museum: **6 hours**

We are asked to find: **How long is he gone from home?**

---

### Step 1: Calculate the time taken to go to the museum

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150}{75} = 2 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken to return home

Since the speed is the same and the distance is the same:

$$
\text{Time returning} = \frac{150}{75} = 2 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add up all the time

- Time going: 2 hours  
- Time at museum: 6 hours  
- Time returning: 2 hours  

$$
\text{Total time} = 2 + 6 + 2 = \boxed{10 \text{ hours}}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**He is gone from home for 10 hours.**
We are given:

- Henry needs to assemble **57 cars** and **73 motorcycles**.
- Each **car** requires **4 wheels**.
- Each **motorcycle** requires **2 wheels**.
- He has a box with **650 wheels**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of wheels needed for cars

$$
\text{Wheels for cars} = 57 \times 4 = 228
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of wheels needed for motorcycles

$$
\text{Wheels for motorcycles} = 73 \times 2 = 146
$$

---

### Step 3: Add the wheels needed for both cars and motorcycles

$$
\text{Total wheels needed} = 228 + 146 = 374
$$

---

### Step 4: Subtract from the total wheels available

$$
\text{Wheels left} = 650 - 374 = 276
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{276}
$$

So, **276 wheels will be left** after Henry assembles all the toys.
Sure! Let's calculate the final price after a 20% discount step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find the discount amount  
The original price of the laptop is **$1000**.  
A 20% discount means you save 20% of $1000.

$$
\text{Discount} = 20\% \times 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200
$$

---

### Step 2: Subtract the discount from the original price  
$$
\text{Final Price} = 1000 - 200 = 800
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
You have to pay **$800**.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out the total cost of replacing Mike's movie collection.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of movies**
Mike has **600 movies** in total.

---

### **Step 2: Movies in series (a third of the total)**
- A third of 600 = $ \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 $ movies
- These are **series movies**, and they cost **$6 each** instead of the normal $10.

So, cost for series movies = $ 200 \times 6 = 1200 $

---

### **Step 3: Remaining movies after series**
Total movies - Series movies = $ 600 - 200 = 400 $ movies

---

### **Step 4: Older movies (40% of the remaining 400)**
- 40% of 400 = $ 0.4 \times 400 = 160 $ older movies
- These older movies cost **$5 each**

Cost for older movies = $ 160 \times 5 = 800 $

---

### **Step 5: Remaining non-series, non-older movies**
- Total remaining after series = 400
- Older movies = 160
- So, non-series, non-older = $ 400 - 160 = 240 $ movies
- These are **normal movies**, costing **$10 each**

Cost for normal movies = $ 240 \times 10 = 2400 $

---

### **Step 6: Total cost**
- Series movies: $1200
- Older movies: $800
- Normal movies: $2400

**Total cost = $1200 + $800 + $2400 = $4400**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The total cost of replacing the movies is $4400.**
Let's break down the cost of each type of fruit Winston picked and then add them up.

---

### **Peaches:**
- Price per pound: $2.00  
- Pounds picked: 6  
- Cost:  
  $$
  6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$12.00
  $$

---

### **Plums:**
- Price per pound: $1.00  
- Pounds picked: 8  
- Cost:  
  $$
  8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00
  $$

---

### **Apricots:**
- Price per pound: $3.00  
- Pounds picked: 6  
- Cost:  
  $$
  6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$18.00
  $$

---

### **Total Cost:**
$$
\$12.00 + \$8.00 + \$18.00 = \$38.00
$$

---

**Answer:** Winston spent **\$38.00** on fruit.
We are given the following information:

- Total time spent traveling (driving + hiking) = **6 hours**
- Driving speed = **50 miles per hour**
- Hiking speed = **5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed**
- Time spent hiking = **1.5 hours**

---

### Step 1: Find the hiking speed

Driving speed = 50 mph  
Half of that = $ \frac{50}{2} = 25 $ mph  
Hiking speed = $ 25 - 5 = 20 $ mph

So, they hiked at **20 miles per hour**.

---

### Step 2: Find the time spent driving

Total time = 6 hours  
Time spent hiking = 1.5 hours  
Time spent driving = $ 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 $ hours

---

### Step 3: Calculate the distance driven and hiked

- **Distance driven** = speed × time = $ 50 \times 4.5 = 225 $ miles  
- **Distance hiked** = speed × time = $ 20 \times 1.5 = 30 $ miles

---

### Step 4: Total distance to the vacation spot

$$
\text{Total distance} = \text{distance driven} + \text{distance hiked} = 225 + 30 = \boxed{255} \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **255 miles**
We are given the scoring system for a video game level:

- **10 points per enemy jumped on**
- **5 points per berry collected**
- **30 points per second left on the timer when the level finishes**

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s define Emma's scores and then express Ava’s in terms of Emma’s.

Let:
- $ e $ = number of enemies Emma jumps on
- $ b $ = number of berries Emma collects
- $ t $ = number of seconds left on the timer when Emma finishes the level

Then, based on the problem:

- Ava jumps on **8 more enemies** than Emma: $ e + 8 $
- Ava collects **3 more berries** than Emma: $ b + 3 $
- Ava finishes **4 seconds slower**, so she has $ t + 4 $ seconds left on the timer

---

### Step 2: Write expressions for scores

**Emma's score:**
$$
E = 10e + 5b + 30t
$$

**Ava's score:**
$$
A = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t + 4)
$$

Now expand Ava's score:
$$
A = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t + 120
$$
$$
A = 10e + 5b + 30t + (80 + 15 + 120)
$$
$$
A = 10e + 5b + 30t + 215
$$

So, Ava's score is **215 points higher** than Emma's.

---

### Step 3: Find the difference between their scores

$$
A - E = (10e + 5b + 30t + 215) - (10e + 5b + 30t) = 215
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{215}
$$

Ava's score is **215 points higher** than Emma's.
We are given:

- Four friends ordered **four pizzas** for a total of **$64**.
- Two of the pizzas cost **$30** each.
- The other two pizzas cost the **same amount**.

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Total cost of all four pizzas
Total cost = $64

---

### Step 2: Cost of the two known pizzas
Each of the two pizzas costs $30, so:

$$
2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Cost of the remaining two pizzas
Total cost of all four pizzas is $64, and we already accounted for $60 from the first two pizzas. So the remaining two pizzas cost:

$$
64 - 60 = 4 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Cost per pizza for the other two
Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the remaining cost by 2:

$$
\frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars per pizza}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Each of the other two pizzas cost **$2**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem

- **Chase and Rider** ride their bikes **thrice a day** for **5 days**.
- On **2 other days**, they ride **twice the times** they do on usual days.
- We are to find how many times they ride their bikes in **a week** (7 days).

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of rides on the first 5 days

They ride **3 times per day** for **5 days**:

$$
5 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ rides/day} = 15 \text{ rides}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the number of rides on the 2 special days

On these 2 days, they ride **twice the usual amount**, which is **6 rides per day** (since 3 × 2 = 6):

$$
2 \text{ days} \times 6 \text{ rides/day} = 12 \text{ rides}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add them together

$$
15 \text{ (from regular days)} + 12 \text{ (from special days)} = 27 \text{ rides}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{27}
$$

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes **27 times a week**.
We are given the following information:

- Bob originally had **7 fish** in his pond:
  - 3 **orange** fish
  - 4 **white** fish

- He bought **17 more fish** from a mixed tank (some white, some orange), and added them to his pond.

- After adding the 17 fish, he found that he now has **twice as many orange fish as white fish**.

We are asked: **How many white fish did Bob buy at the store?**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ w $ = number of **white fish** Bob bought
- $ o $ = number of **orange fish** Bob bought

We know:
- $ w + o = 17 $ (since he bought 17 fish total)

Also, after adding these fish to his original 3 orange and 4 white fish, the total number of orange and white fish is:

- Total orange: $ 3 + o $
- Total white: $ 4 + w $

And we're told:
$$
\text{Total orange} = 2 \times \text{Total white}
$$
So:
$$
3 + o = 2(4 + w)
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve the equations

We have two equations:

1. $ w + o = 17 $
2. $ 3 + o = 2(4 + w) $

Let’s simplify equation 2:

$$
3 + o = 8 + 2w \\
o = 8 + 2w - 3 = 5 + 2w
$$

Now plug this into equation 1:

$$
w + (5 + 2w) = 17 \\
3w + 5 = 17 \\
3w = 12 \\
w = 4
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the number of orange fish bought

From earlier:
$$
o = 5 + 2w = 5 + 2(4) = 5 + 8 = 13
$$

Check:
- Total fish bought: $ w + o = 4 + 13 = 17 $ ✅
- Total white fish now: $ 4 + 4 = 8 $
- Total orange fish now: $ 3 + 13 = 16 $
- Is 16 = 2 × 8? Yes ✅

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.**
Let's break this down step by step to calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the one-way distance**
- One-way distance = **5 miles**

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the round-trip distance per day**
- Round trip = 5 miles (to work) + 5 miles (back home) = **10 miles per day**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the number of days per week**
- Andy works **Monday to Friday** → **5 days per week**

---

### **Step 4: Total distance driven per week**
- Distance per day = 10 miles  
- Days per week = 5  
- **Total distance per week = 10 × 5 = 50 miles**

---

### **Step 5: Calculate fuel used per week**
- Fuel efficiency = **10 miles per gallon**  
- So, gallons used per week = total miles ÷ miles per gallon  
- **Gallons used per week = 50 ÷ 10 = 5 gallons**

---

### **Step 6: Calculate cost of gas per week**
- Price of gas = **$3 per gallon**  
- Cost per week = gallons used × price per gallon  
- **Cost per week = 5 × 3 = $15**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Andy's car is consuming **$15 per week**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total value of the quarters**

Carrie has **140 quarters**.

- Each quarter is worth **$0.25**.
- So, the total value of the quarters is:

$$
140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the total value of the twenties**

Carrie has **10 twenties**.

- Each twenty is worth **$20**.
- So, the total value of the twenties is:

$$
10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how much of the twenties she spent**

She spent **3/5 of the twenties**.

$$
\frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add the amounts to find the total money spent**

- Quarters: $35
- Twenties spent: $120

$$
35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{155}

### Step 2: Calculate total tomatoes

Each tomato plant gives 22 tomatoes, and he has 5 tomato plants:

$$
5 \text{ plants} \times 22 \text{ tomatoes/plant} = 110 \text{ tomatoes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate total eggplants

Each eggplant plant gives 4 eggplants, and he has 8 eggplant plants:

$$
8 \text{ plants} \times 4 \text{ eggplants/plant} = 32 \text{ eggplants}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add them together

Now, add the total number of tomatoes and eggplants:

$$
110 \text{ tomatoes} + 32 \text{ eggplants} = 142 \text{ fruits}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{142}
$$

Ricardo can get **142 fruits** from his plants.
We are told:

- One-fourth of the sales are **smart TVs**.
- One-eighth of the sales are **analog TVs**.
- The **rest** are **OLED TVs**.
- Total number of TVs sold = **40**.

---

### Step 1: Find the fraction of OLED TVs

Let’s add up the fractions of smart and analog TVs:

$$
\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{2}{8} + \frac{1}{8} = \frac{3}{8}
$$

So, the remaining fraction that is **OLED TVs** is:

$$
1 - \frac{3}{8} = \frac{5}{8}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many OLED TVs were sold

Since the total number of TVs sold is 40, the number of OLED TVs sold is:

$$
\frac{5}{8} \times 40 = \frac{200}{8} = 25
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**25 OLED TVs** were sold.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total cost of the trip**: $300  
2. **School will cover half the cost**:  
   $$
   \frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150
   $$  
   So, the school will pay **$150**.

3. **John has already raised**: $50

4. **Amount John still needs to raise**:  
   $$
   300 - 150 - 50 = 100
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: John is missing **$100**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the problem**

- **Freezing point of pipes:** 32°F  
- **Heating per log of wood:** +5°F  
- **Daytime temperature:** 45°F  
- **Nighttime temperature is 33°F colder than daytime.**  
- **Goal:** Keep the house above 32°F to prevent the pipes from freezing.

---

### **Step 2: Find the nighttime temperature**

Nighttime temperature = Daytime temperature - 33°F  
= 45°F - 33°F = **12°F**

So, during the night, the temperature is **12°F**, which is **below the freezing point of 32°F**.

Carson needs to **burn logs to raise the temperature above 32°F** before it freezes.

---

### **Step 3: How much heating is needed?**

Current temperature at night = 12°F  
Target temperature to prevent freezing = 32°F  
Temperature needed to reach = 32°F - 12°F = **20°F**

Each log adds **5°F** of heat.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate number of logs needed**

Number of logs = Required temperature increase ÷ Heat per log  
= 20°F ÷ 5°F per log = **4 logs**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.**
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the number of groups**

We are told that **90 people** were split into **9-person groups**.

So, the number of groups is:

$$
\frac{90}{9} = 10 \text{ groups}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find how many groups brought seashells**

We are told that **3/5 of the number of groups** had members bring back **2 seashells each**.

First, calculate **3/5 of the number of groups**:

$$
\frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \text{ groups}
$$

So, **6 groups** had members bringing back seashells.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total number of seashells**

Each of these 6 groups had **members bring back 2 seashells each**. But we need to know how many people are in each group.

Each group has **9 people**, and each person brings **2 seashells**.

So, per group:

$$
9 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ seashells/person} = 18 \text{ seashells per group}
$$

Now multiply by the number of such groups (6):

$$
6 \text{ groups} \times 18 \text{ seashells/group} = 108 \text{ seashells}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{108}
$$

So, they brought a total of **108 seashells**.
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Initial number of people on the train:**  
   $ 172 $

2. **At the first stop:**
   - 47 people get off:  
     $ 172 - 47 = 125 $
   - 13 people get on:  
     $ 125 + 13 = 138 $

3. **At the next stop:**
   - 38 people get off:  
     $ 138 - 38 = 100 $

### Final Answer:  
**100 people are on the train.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Bottle caps found per day**: 10  
2. **Value of each bottle cap**: $0.25  
3. **Number of days in a month**: 30  

---

### Step 1: Calculate daily earnings  
$$
10 \text{ caps/day} \times \$0.25/\text{cap} = \$2.50 \text{ per day}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate total earnings for 30 days  
$$
\$2.50/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$75
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Damien makes \$75 in a 30-day month.**
We are given the following information:

- **Regular hourly rate**: $20 per hour  
- **Regular work hours per day**: 8 hours  
- **Special hourly rate (for additional hours)**: 150% of regular rate  
- **Hours worked on Tuesday**: 11 hours  

---

### Step 1: Determine how many hours were at the regular rate

She works **8 hours** at the regular rate.

So, the number of **additional hours** is:

$$
11 - 8 = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the special hourly rate

The special rate is **150% of her regular hourly rate**:

$$
1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate earnings for each part of the day

- **Regular hours (8 hours)**:
  $$
  8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
  $$

- **Additional hours (3 hours)**:
  $$
  3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### Step 4: Add the two amounts together

$$
160 + 90 = 250 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{250}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

1. The zookeeper counts **12 female lions**.
2. She counts **half as many male lions** as female lions.  
   - Half of 12 is $ \frac{12}{2} = 6 $, so there are **6 male lions**.
3. She also counts **14 lion cubs**.

Now, add them all together to find the total number of lions:

$$
12 \text{ (female)} + 6 \text{ (male)} + 14 \text{ (cubs)} = 32
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **32 lions** in the enclosure.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find the discount amount  
The jeans are **25% off** the original price of **$40**.

$$
\text{Discount} = 25\% \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = 10
$$

So, the discount is **$10**.

---

### Step 2: Find the discounted price  
Subtract the discount from the original price:

$$
\text{Discounted Price} = 40 - 10 = 30
$$

So, the jeans cost **$30** after the discount.

---

### Step 3: Calculate how much money Mike will have left  
Mike pays with a **$50 bill**, and the jeans cost **$30**.

$$
\text{Money left} = 50 - 30 = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
Mike will have **$20.00** left over.
Let's break this down step by step to calculate the **total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months**.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Employee Count**
- The company starts with **200 employees**.

---

### **Step 2: Monthly Hiring**
- The company hires **20 new employees every month**.
- Over **3 months**, the total number of new employees hired is:

$$
20 \text{ employees/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 60 \text{ employees}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total Employees After 3 Months**
- Initial employees: 200  
- New employees: 60  
- Total employees after 3 months:

$$
200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees}
$$

---

---

### **Step 5: Total Monthly Salary Payment**
- Total salary paid each month is:

$$
260 \text{ employees} \times \$4000/\text{employee} = \$1,040,000 \text{ per month}
$$

---

### **Step 6: Total Salary Over 3 Months**
- Total salary over 3 months:

$$
\$1,040,000/\text{month} \times 3 \text{ months} = \$3,120,000
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$3,120,000}
$$

This is the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Determine how many times each song is sung:**
   - "Deck the Halls" is sung **twice**.
   - "Jingle Bells" is sung **once**.

2. **Find the length of each song:**
   - "Deck the Halls" = **150 seconds**.
   - "Jingle Bells" = **240 seconds**.

3. **Calculate the total time for each song:**
   - Total time for "Deck the Halls" = 2 × 150 = **300 seconds**.
   - Total time for "Jingle Bells" = 1 × 240 = **240 seconds**.

4. **Add the two totals together:**
   - Total caroling time = 300 + 240 = **540 seconds**.

### ✅ Final Answer: **540 seconds**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine Billy's hourly wage over time**

- **Starting wage:** $10 per hour
- **After 2 months:** Raise of $0.50 → New wage = $10 + $0.50 = **$10.50 per hour**
- **On his first anniversary (after 12 months):** Raise of $1.00 → New wage = $10.50 + $1.00 = **$11.50 per hour**

So, **Billy’s hourly wage changes** as follows:

- First 2 months: $10/hour
- Next 10 months (months 3–12): $10.50/hour
- After 12 months (month 13 onward): $11.50/hour

But the problem says **both Billy and Sally work 20 hours** — we don’t need to know how long they’ve been working, just their **hourly rates** at the time of working those 20 hours.

However, we are not told when Sally started working relative to Billy. So we have to assume that **Sally started working at the same time as Billy**, or that **we are comparing their wages at the same point in time**.

But let’s be clear:

> "Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is **$0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was**."

So, **Sally's starting wage is $10.50 per hour**, since Billy's **starting wage was $10 per hour**.

So:

- **Billy’s starting wage:** $10/hour
- **Sally’s starting wage:** $10.50/hour

---

### **Step 2: Calculate earnings for 20 hours**

- **Billy’s earnings:**  
  $10.50/hour × 20 hours = **$210**

- **Sally’s earnings:**  
  $10.50/hour × 20 hours = **$210**

Wait! That would mean **they earn the same amount**, but the question asks:

> **"How much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?"**

This suggests that **their hourly rates are different**, but according to the information given, **Sally’s starting rate is $0.50 more than Billy’s starting rate**, so if they both work **20 hours**, they should earn the **same amount**, unless there is a misunderstanding.

Let’s recheck the key sentence:

> "Sally just started working at a different business, and her starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was."

So **Sally starts at $10.50/hour**, and **Billy started at $10/hour**.

So:

- **Billy’s hourly rate = $10/hour**
- **Sally’s hourly rate = $10.50/hour**

Now, if **both work 20 hours**, then:

- **Billy earns:** $10 × 20 = **$200**
- **Sally earns:** $10.50 × 20 = **$210**

So **Billy earns $200**, **Sally earns $210** → **Billy earns $10 less than Sally**

But the question is:

> "How much more money will Billy earn than Sally, in dollars?"

That is, **how much more does Billy earn than Sally?**

So the answer is:

$$
\boxed{-10}
$$

Or, in other words, **Billy earns $10 less than Sally**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{-10}
$$

(Billy earns **$10 less** than Sally.)
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Find the cost of 3 loaves of bread
- Each loaf of bread costs **$2**.
- So, 3 loaves cost:  
  $$
  3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ dollars}
  $$

### Step 2: Find the cost of 2 bagels
- Each bagel costs **$1**.
- So, 2 bagels cost:  
  $$
  2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ dollars}
  $$

### Step 3: Find the difference in cost
- Cost of 3 loaves: $6  
- Cost of 2 bagels: $2  
- Difference:  
  $$
  6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
  $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{4} \text{ dollars}
$$

So, **3 loaves of bread cost $4 more than 2 bagels**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Pierson's score
Pierson scored **278 points** in one game of bowling.

---

### Step 2: Nikita's score
Nikita scored **11 more than half as many as Pierson**.

First, find half of Pierson's score:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 278 = 139
$$

Now add 11 to that:

$$
139 + 11 = 150
$$

So, **Nikita scored 150 points**.

---

### Step 3: Total points
Now, add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together:

$$
278 + 150 = 428
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Pierson and Nikita had a total of 428 points.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many trees will be planted in total.

---

### **Step 1: Find the number of students per class**
Each class has:
- 25 students

---

### **Step 2: Find the number of teachers per class**
Each class has:
- 3 teachers

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the number of trees planted per class**

- Each **student** plants **1 tree**:  
  $ 25 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree} = 25 \text{ trees} $

- Each **teacher** plants **2 trees**:  
  $ 3 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees} = 6 \text{ trees} $

- Total trees per class:  
  $ 25 + 6 = 31 \text{ trees} $

---

### **Step 4: Multiply by the number of classes**

The school has:
- 40 classes

Total trees planted:
$$
40 \text{ classes} \times 31 \text{ trees/class} = 1240 \text{ trees}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{1240} \text{ trees}
$$
We are told that Bubbles currently has the following stuffed animals:

- 3 stuffed **puppies**
- 5 stuffed **koalas**
- 2 stuffed **zebras**
- 4 stuffed **frogs**

Let’s first find the **total number of stuffed animals** she currently has:

$$
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \text{ stuffed animals}
$$

Now, she wants to **buy some stuffed goats** so that the **percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all her stuffed animals**.

Let’s denote the number of **stuffed goats** she needs to buy as $ x $.

After buying $ x $ goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:

$$
14 + x
$$

We want the **percentage of stuffed goats** to be **30%**, so:

$$
\frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30
$$

Now solve for $ x $:

$$
x = 0.30(14 + x)
$$

$$
x = 4.2 + 0.30x
$$

Subtract $ 0.30x $ from both sides:

$$
x - 0.30x = 4.2
$$

$$
0.70x = 4.2
$$

$$
x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} = 6
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Bubbles should buy **6 stuffed goats**.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many hours Kris still needs to play to reach the 30-hour goal.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate total hours played in the first 2 weeks**

Kris plays **half an hour (0.5 hours)** every day for **2 weeks**.

- 2 weeks = 14 days  
- 0.5 hours/day × 14 days = **7 hours**

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total hours played in the next week**

Then, she plays **2 hours every day** for **1 week**.

- 1 week = 7 days  
- 2 hours/day × 7 days = **14 hours**

---

### **Step 3: Add both periods together**

Total hours played so far = 7 hours + 14 hours = **21 hours**

---

### **Step 4: Find how many more hours are needed**

Goal = 30 hours  
Hours already played = 21 hours  
Remaining hours = 30 – 21 = **9 hours**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **Kris still needs to play 9 more hours** to earn the achievement.
We are given:

- **Car A** (first car) is traveling at **60 mph**.
- **Car B** (second car) passes Car A and travels at **70 mph**.
- Both cars continue at the same speeds.
- We are to find how many **miles separate them after 2 hours**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the situation

At the moment Car B passes Car A, they are **at the same position**. From that point onward, Car B is going faster than Car A, so it will **move away** from Car A.

So, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours is the **difference in their distances traveled** over that time.

---

### Step 2: Calculate distance each car travels in 2 hours

- Distance = Speed × Time

#### For Car A (60 mph):
$$
\text{Distance}_A = 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ miles}
$$

#### For Car B (70 mph):
$$
\text{Distance}_B = 70 \times 2 = 140 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the distance between them

$$
\text{Distance apart} = \text{Distance}_B - \text{Distance}_A = 140 - 120 = 20 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{20} \text{ miles}
$$

After 2 hours, the two cars will be **20 miles apart**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Cost of the diamond**: $600  
2. **Cost of the gold**: $300  
3. **Total base cost** (before premium):  
   $$
   600 + 300 = 900
   $$

4. **Premium**: 30% of the total base cost  
   $$
   0.30 \times 900 = 270
   $$

5. **Total amount James paid**:  
   $$
   900 + 270 = 1170
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$1,170**
Let's break this down step by step to find the **school's overall pass rate**.

---

### Step 1: Find the pass rate for each grade

#### Third Grade:
- Passed: 340 out of 500
- Pass rate = $ \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 $ or **68%**

#### Fourth Grade:
- Passed: 40 out of 100
- Pass rate = $ \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 $ or **40%**

#### Fifth Grade:
- Pass rate is **twice** the fourth grade pass rate.
- So, fifth grade pass rate = $ 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 $ or **80%**

---

### Step 2: Find the number of students who passed in each grade

#### Third Grade:
- 340 passed (already given)

#### Fourth Grade:
- 40 passed (already given)

#### Fifth Grade:
- Total students: 400
- Pass rate = 80%
- Passed = $ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 $

---

### Step 3: Total number of students and total number of students who passed

- Total students:
  - 500 (third) + 100 (fourth) + 400 (fifth) = **1000 students**
  
- Total students who passed:
  - 340 (third) + 40 (fourth) + 320 (fifth) = **700 students**

---

### Step 4: Calculate the overall pass rate

$$
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total passed}}{\text{Total students}} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 \text{ or } 70\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **70%**
We are given the following information:

- **Glass chips per square inch** = 12 chips
- **Chips per bag** = 72 chips
- **Number of bags** = 2
- **Height of mosaic** = 3 inches

We need to find how **long** (in inches) Milo can make his mosaic.

---

### Step 1: Total number of glass chips Milo has

He has **2 bags**, each with **72 chips**:

$$
\text{Total chips} = 2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips}
$$

---

### Step 2: Chips needed per square inch

Milo needs **12 chips per square inch**.

So, the **area** (in square inches) that can be covered with 144 chips is:

$$
\text{Area} = \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches}
$$

---

### Step 3: Area of the mosaic

The mosaic is **3 inches tall**, and we want to find its **length**.

Let the **length** be $ L $ inches. Then the area is:

$$
\text{Area} = \text{height} \times \text{length} = 3 \times L
$$

We already found the area is **12 square inches**, so:

$$
3L = 12
$$

Solving for $ L $:

$$
L = \frac{12}{3} = 4
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{4} \text{ inches}
$$

Milo can make his mosaic **4 inches long**.
We are given:

- **10 quarts of tea** are left after the party.
- **4 students** each drank **1.5 quarts**.
- **16 students** each drank **2 quarts**.

We need to find how many **gallons** of tea were at the **beginning** of the party.

---

### Step 1: Calculate total amount of tea drunk

#### Tea drunk by 4 students:
$$
4 \text{ students} \times 1.5 \text{ quarts/student} = 6 \text{ quarts}
$$

#### Tea drunk by 16 students:
$$
16 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ quarts/student} = 32 \text{ quarts}
$$

#### Total tea drunk:
$$
6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}
$$

---

### Step 2: Add the remaining tea

$$
\text{Total tea at beginning} = \text{Tea drunk} + \text{Tea left}
= 38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts}
$$

---

### Step 3: Convert quarts to gallons

We know that:
$$
1 \text{ gallon} = 4 \text{ quarts}
$$

So:
$$
48 \text{ quarts} \div 4 = 12 \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{12} \text{ gallons}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Initial order**: Dale ordered **100** butterscotch candies and wanted to sell them.
2. **Sold so far**: He ended up selling **150** candies.
3. **Second order**: He then ordered **100 more** candies.

Now, we need to figure out how many **total** candies he has, and how many he still needs to sell to **sell all of them**.

---

### Step 1: Total number of candies
- First order: 100
- Second order: 100
- **Total = 100 + 100 = 200 candies**

---

### Step 2: How many has he already sold?
- He sold **150** candies.

---

### Step 3: How many does he still need to sell?
- Total candies = 200
- Sold = 150
- Remaining = 200 - 150 = **50**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Dale still needs to sell **50** butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.
We are told that the number of students on campus **doubles at the end of every month**, and that there are **10 students at the beginning of the year**.

We are to find how many **additional students** have joined by the **end of May**, **above and beyond** the original 10 students.

---

### Step 1: Understand the growth pattern

- Start with 10 students.
- At the **end of each month**, the number of students **doubles**.
- So, this is exponential growth:  
  $$
  S(t) = 10 \times 2^t
  $$
  where $ t $ is the number of months since the start of the year.

But we want to find the **number of additional students** by the **end of May**.

---

### Step 2: Determine the number of months

- The year starts at the beginning of January.
- By the **end of May**, that is **5 full months** (January through May).

So, after 5 months, the number of students is:

$$
S(5) = 10 \times 2^5 = 10 \times 32 = 320
$$

So, by the end of May, there are **320 students** on campus.

---

### Step 3: Find the number of **additional students**

The original number of students was **10**. So, the number of **additional students** is:

$$
320 - 10 = 310
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{310}
$$

So, **310 additional students** would have joined by the end of May.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Given:
- Felix charges **$0.25 per branch** he climbs.
- He made **$105** during the week.
- We need to find the **average number of branches he climbed per day**.

---

### Step 1: Find total number of branches climbed

Since he charges **$0.25 per branch**, we can find the total number of branches he climbed by dividing his total earnings by the rate:

$$
\text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Rate per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
$$

$$
\text{Total branches} = 420
$$

---

### Step 2: Find average branches per day

Assuming a **week has 7 days**, we divide the total branches by 7 to get the average per day:

$$
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**60 branches per day on average.**
Let's break this down step by step to find the total number of petals on the flowers in the vase.

---

### Step 1: First batch of flowers
- **3 flowers**, each with **5 petals**
- Total petals = $ 3 \times 5 = 15 $

---

### Step 2: Second batch of flowers
- **4 flowers**, each with **6 petals**
- Total petals = $ 4 \times 6 = 24 $

---

### Step 3: Third batch of flowers
- **5 flowers**, each with **4 petals**
- Total petals = $ 5 \times 4 = 20 $

---

### Step 4: Fourth batch of flowers
- **6 flowers**, each with **7 petals**
- Total petals = $ 6 \times 7 = 42 $

---

### Step 5: Total petals before any are lost
Add up all the petals from the four batches:

$$
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101
$$

---

### Step 6: Lost petals (due to dropping and wind)
- Rose drops **1 of each** type of flower, so she loses:
  - 1 flower with 5 petals → 5 petals lost
  - 1 flower with 6 petals → 6 petals lost
  - 1 flower with 4 petals → 4 petals lost
  - 1 flower with 7 petals → 7 petals lost

Total petals lost = $ 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 $

---

### Step 7: Final total petals in the vase
$$
101 - 22 = 79
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **79 petals** in total in the vase.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total marshmallows**
The bag has **35 marshmallows**.

---

### **Step 2: Marshmallows used for S'mores**
- John makes **9 S'mores**, using **9 marshmallows**.
- DeSean makes **9 S'mores**, using **9 marshmallows**.

So together, they used:

$$
9 + 9 = 18 \text{ marshmallows}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Marshmallows dropped**
They **dropped 3 marshmallows** on the ground.

So total marshmallows used or lost:

$$
18 \text{ (used)} + 3 \text{ (dropped)} = 21 \text{ marshmallows}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Marshmallows left in the bag**
Total marshmallows – marshmallows used and dropped:

$$
35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows left}
$$

---

### **Step 5: How many S'mores can each kid make with the remaining marshmallows?**

Each S'more uses **1 marshmallow**, so with **14 marshmallows left**, they can make **14 S'mores** in total.

Now, we need to divide these 14 S'mores between **John and DeSean** equally.

$$
14 \div 2 = 7
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Each kid can have **7 S'mores** with the marshmallows left in the bag.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much money is used in total.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the game time per person**

- **Jack** can play for **20 minutes** per quarter.
- **Two of his friends are worse**: they can only play **half as long** as Jack →  
  $ \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 $ minutes per quarter.
- **One of his friends is better**: can play **1.5 times as long** as Jack →  
  $ 1.5 \times 20 = 30 $ minutes per quarter.

---

### **Step 2: Total time played by each person**

They play for **4 hours** = **240 minutes**.

We need to calculate how many quarters (i.e., how many 20-minute sessions) each person can play in 240 minutes.

#### **Jack:**
- Time per quarter: 20 minutes
- Number of quarters:  
  $ \frac{240}{20} = 12 $ quarters

#### **Worse Friend 1:**
- Time per quarter: 10 minutes
- Number of quarters:  
  $ \frac{240}{10} = 24 $ quarters

#### **Worse Friend 2:**
- Same as Friend 1 → 24 quarters

#### **Better Friend:**
- Time per quarter: 30 minutes
- Number of quarters:  
  $ \frac{240}{30} = 8 $ quarters

---

### **Step 3: Total money spent**

Each quarter costs **$0.25**.

Now, compute the total number of quarters played:

- Jack: 12 quarters  
- Worse Friend 1: 24 quarters  
- Worse Friend 2: 24 quarters  
- Better Friend: 8 quarters  

Total quarters =  
$ 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 $ quarters

Total cost =  
$ 68 \times 0.25 = 17 $ dollars

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $17**
We are told that Tanya makes a **salt scrub** using the following ingredients:

- **Salt**
- **Oil**
- **Fragrance**
- **Citrus zest**
- **Sugar**

She fills a **10-ounce jar** each time.

We are given the relationships between the amounts of the ingredients:

---

### Let’s define variables:

Let:
- $ s $ = ounces of **salt**
- $ o $ = ounces of **oil**
- $ f $ = ounces of **fragrance**
- $ z $ = ounces of **citrus zest**
- $ g $ = ounces of **sugar**

We are told:

1. She uses the **same amount of citrus zest as fragrance**:
   $$
   z = f
   $$

2. She uses the **same amount of salt as sugar**:
   $$
   s = g
   $$

3. She uses **twice as much oil as salt**:
   $$
   o = 2s
   $$

4. She uses **twice as much salt as zest**:
   $$
   s = 2z
   $$

Also, the total is 10 ounces:
$$
s + o + f + z + g = 10
$$

---

### Step-by-step solution:

From (4):  
$$
s = 2z \Rightarrow z = \frac{s}{2}
$$

From (1):  
$$
z = f \Rightarrow f = \frac{s}{2}
$$

From (2):  
$$
s = g \Rightarrow g = s
$$

From (3):  
$$
o = 2s
$$

Now substitute all into the total equation:

$$
s + o + f + z + g = 10
$$

Substitute:
- $ o = 2s $
- $ f = \frac{s}{2} $
- $ z = \frac{s}{2} $
- $ g = s $

So:

$$
s + 2s + \frac{s}{2} + \frac{s}{2} + s = 10
$$

Simplify:

$$
s + 2s + s + \frac{s}{2} + \frac{s}{2} = 10
$$

Combine like terms:

$$
(1 + 2 + 1) s + (\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}) s = 10
$$

$$
4s + s = 10
$$

$$
5s = 10
$$

$$
s = 2
$$

Now find $ o $:

$$
o = 2s = 2 \times 2 = 4
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the goats
John buys **3 goats** at **$500 each**.

$$
3 \times 500 = 1500
$$

So, the total cost for the goats is **$1500**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the cows
John buys **2 cows** at **$1500 each**.

$$
2 \times 1500 = 3000
$$

So, the total cost for the cows is **$3000**.

---

### Step 3: Add the two amounts together
Now, add the cost of the goats and the cows to find the total amount John spent:

$$
1500 + 3000 = 4500
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**John spent $4500.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total cupcakes needed**
Paul needs **63 cupcakes** for the birthday party.

---

### **Step 2: Cupcakes he already has**
- Chocolate cupcakes: **8**
- Toffee cupcakes: **40**

So, total cupcakes he already has =  
$$
8 + 40 = 48
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy**

He needs 63 total, and he already has 48.  
So, the number of cupcakes he still needs to buy is:  
$$
63 - 48 = 15
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**  
Paul should buy **15 more cupcakes**.
We are given the following information:

- **Robert has 20 cars.**
- **Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.**
- **Joe sells 20% of his cars.**
- **He gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother.**
- We need to find how many cars **Joe remains with** after selling and giving some to his mother.

---

### Step 1: Find how many cars Joe has initially

Joe has **twice as many cars as Robert**, and Robert has **20 cars**.

$$
\text{Joe's cars} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ cars}
$$

---

### Step 2: How many cars does Joe sell?

Joe sells **20%** of his cars.

$$
\text{Cars sold} = 20\% \times 40 = 0.2 \times 40 = 8 \text{ cars}
$$

---

### Step 3: How many cars does he give to his mother?

He gives away **twice as many cars as the number he sold**.

$$
\text{Cars given to mother} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ cars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total cars Joe gives away

$$
\text{Total given away} = \text{cars sold} + \text{cars given to mother} = 8 + 16 = 24 \text{ cars}
$$

---

### Step 5: How many cars does Joe remain with?

$$
\text{Remaining cars} = \text{Initial cars} - \text{Total given away} = 40 - 24 = 16 \text{ cars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{16}
$$
We are given the following information:

- There are **20 students** working together.
- The **total amount raised** is **$175,000**.
- **$50,000** comes from **organizations**.
- The **rest** comes from the **students**.
- Each student raises the **same amount**.

---

### Step 1: Find out how much was raised by the students

Total amount raised = $175,000  
Amount from organizations = $50,000  

So, the amount raised by the students is:

$$
175,000 - 50,000 = 125,000
$$

---

### Step 2: Divide this amount equally among the 20 students

$$
\frac{125,000}{20} = 6,250
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Each student raised **$6,250**.
We are given the following information:

- On **Day 1**, Sandy walked from **Holloway Shores to Sun Valley Shores** for **8 hours**.
- On **Day 2**, she walked **half as many hours** as on Day 1, but this time to **Hollock Valley Shores**.

We are asked to find the **total time Sandy took to walk in the two days**, in **minutes**.

---

### Step 1: Find the time on Day 2

On Day 1:  
Time = 8 hours  
On Day 2:  
Time = (1/2) × 8 hours = **4 hours**

---

### Step 2: Add the times for both days

Total time in hours = 8 + 4 = **12 hours**

---

### Step 3: Convert hours to minutes

1 hour = 60 minutes  
So, 12 hours = 12 × 60 = **720 minutes**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**720 minutes**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Initial Count
Hunter counted **50 cars** in the parking lot when entering class one morning.

---

### Step 2: First Break
During the first break, he counted **20 more cars** in the parking lot.

So, the total number of cars after the first break is:

$$
50 + 20 = 70 \text{ cars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Lunch Break
When he got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that **half the number of cars in the parking lot had gone**.

That means **half of the 70 cars were no longer there**.

So, the number of cars that had left is:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35 \text{ cars}
$$

Therefore, the number of cars still in the parking lot at lunch time is:

$$
70 - 35 = 35 \text{ cars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total Number of Cars Counted During Lunch Break

The question asks: **What's the total number of cars he counted during lunch break?**

This refers to the **number of cars that had gone**, which is:

$$
\boxed{35}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{35}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much John makes in a full 7-day week.

---

### **Step 1: Find out how much John earns per cycle**

- Each cycle has **5 tasks**.
- Each task pays **$1.20**.

So, earnings per cycle =  
$$
5 \text{ tasks} \times \$1.20/\text{task} = \$6.00
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find out how much he earns per day**

- He does **30 cycles per day**.

So, daily earnings =  
$$
30 \text{ cycles/day} \times \$6.00/\text{cycle} = \$180.00
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find out how much he earns in a 7-day week**

- He works **7 days a week**.

So, weekly earnings =  
$$
\$180.00/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days} = \$1,260.00
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
John makes **\$1,260.00** in a full 7-day week.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **First Game:**
- **Sasha scored:** 14 points.
- **Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha.**

So, Julie's score in the first game is:

$$
14 - 4 = 10 \text{ points}
$$

---

### **Second Game:**
- This game is at **Julie's home court**, so **Sasha struggles**.
- It says: **"Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game."**

We already found that Julie scored **10 points** in the first game.

So, Sasha's score in the second game is:

$$
10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points}
$$

---

### **Total Points for Sasha:**

$$
\text{First game} + \text{Second game} = 14 + 4 = \boxed{18}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **18 points**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find the total number of cat food tins

Kimberly bought **8 packages of cat food**, and each package has **11 tins**.

$$
8 \times 11 = 88 \text{ tins of cat food}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the total number of dog food tins

Kimberly bought **6 packages of dog food**, and each package has **6 tins**.

$$
6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ tins of dog food}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find how many more tins of cat food than dog food

Subtract the number of dog food tins from the number of cat food tins:

$$
88 - 36 = 52
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{52}
$$

Kimberly bought **52 more tins of cat food than dog food**.
We are given the following information:

- Total number of cards = **341**
- Becca has **12 more** cards than Smendrick.
- Smendrick has **3 times** as many cards as PJ.

Let’s define variables:

- Let $ P $ be the number of cards **PJ** has.
- Then, **Smendrick** has $ 3P $ cards.
- And **Becca** has $ 3P + 12 $ cards.

Now, add up all the cards:

$$
P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341
$$

Simplify:

$$
P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \\
7P + 12 = 341
$$

Subtract 12 from both sides:

$$
7P = 329
$$

Divide by 7:

$$
P = \frac{329}{7} = 47
$$

So:

- **PJ** has $ P = 47 $ cards  
- **Smendrick** has $ 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141 $ cards  
- **Becca** has $ 3P + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153 $ cards

### ✅ Final Answer: **Becca has 153 cards.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are told:

- Cindy has **5 green eggs**.
- She has **twice as many blue eggs as green eggs**.
- She has **one fewer pink egg than blue eggs**.
- She has **one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs**.

We need to find the **total number of eggs** she has.

---

### Step 1: Green Eggs
She has **5 green eggs**.

$$
\text{Green} = 5
$$

---

### Step 2: Blue Eggs
She has **twice as many blue eggs as green eggs**.

$$
\text{Blue} = 2 \times \text{Green} = 2 \times 5 = 10
$$

---

### Step 3: Pink Eggs
She has **one fewer pink egg than blue eggs**.

$$
\text{Pink} = \text{Blue} - 1 = 10 - 1 = 9
$$

---

### Step 4: Yellow Eggs
She has **one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs**.

$$
\text{Yellow} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Pink} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
$$

---

### Step 5: Total Eggs

Now we add all the eggs together:

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Green} + \text{Blue} + \text{Pink} + \text{Yellow}
$$
$$
= 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{27}
$$

Cindy had **27 eggs** altogether.
Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how much **Milly will lose**.

---

### **1. Information Given:**

- **Book weight:** 4 pounds  
- **Book cost:** $32  
- **Distance to return center:** 20 miles  
- **Shipping charge:**  
  - $0.35 per pound  
  - $0.08 per mile  
- **Amazon refund:** 75% of book's purchase price  

---

### **2. Step 1: Calculate the shipping cost**

The shipping company charges:

- **Per pound:** $0.35 × 4 = $1.40  
- **Per mile:** $0.08 × 20 = $1.60  

So, total shipping cost = $1.40 + $1.60 = **$3.00**

---

### **3. Step 2: Calculate the refund from Amazon**

Amazon refunds **75%** of the book’s price:

- 75% of $32 = 0.75 × 32 = **$24**

---

### **4. Step 3: Calculate Milly’s loss**

Milly has to pay the **shipping cost** and loses the **remaining portion of the book’s price** (i.e., the part not refunded).

- Total amount paid: **$3.00 (shipping)**
- Refund received: **$24**
- Original book cost: **$32**

So, the **net loss** is:

$$
\text{Loss} = \text{Book cost} - \text{Refund} + \text{Shipping cost}
$$

$$
\text{Loss} = 32 - 24 + 3 = 11
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Milly will lose $11.**
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Initial amount of money Mulan has:**  
   $40

2. **Her father gives her $100:**  
   $40 + $100 = **$140**

3. **She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each:**  
   2 × $30 = $60

4. **She also buys a bag for $20:**  
   $60 + $20 = **$80**

5. **Subtract the total cost from her total money:**  
   $140 - $80 = **$60**

### ✅ Final Answer: **Mulan has $60 left.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Given:
- **Total chocolate bars produced per month**: 50,000
- **First week**: Boris produces **8,000** bars.
- **Second week**: He produces **half as much as the first week**.
- **Third week**: He produces **three times as much as the first week**.
- We are to find out how many bars he produces in the **fourth week**.

---

### Step 1: First week
- First week production = **8,000** bars

---

### Step 2: Second week
- Second week = (1/2) × First week  
- Second week = (1/2) × 8,000 = **4,000** bars

---

### Step 3: Third week
- Third week = 3 × First week  
- Third week = 3 × 8,000 = **24,000** bars

---

### Step 4: Total production for first three weeks
- First week: 8,000  
- Second week: 4,000  
- Third week: 24,000  
- Total so far = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = **36,000** bars

---

### Step 5: Fourth week production
- Total monthly production = 50,000 bars  
- Already produced in first 3 weeks = 36,000  
- So, fourth week production = 50,000 – 36,000 = **14,000** bars

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much time Britany spends on **TikTok in a month (4 weeks)**.

---

### 1. **Time spent recording TikTok videos**

- **18 videos per week**
- **Each video is 4 minutes long**

So, weekly time spent recording TikTok videos:

$$
18 \text{ videos/week} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
$$

In a month (4 weeks):

$$
72 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 288 \text{ minutes/month}
$$

---

### 2. **Time spent writing songs**

- **2 hours per week**

Convert that to minutes:

$$
2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ minutes}
$$

In a month:

$$
120 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 480 \text{ minutes/month}
$$

---

### 3. **Time spent doing makeup**

- **15 minutes, 6 days a week**

So, weekly time for makeup:

$$
15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 90 \text{ minutes/week}
$$

In a month:

$$
90 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 360 \text{ minutes/month}
$$

---

### 4. **Total time spent on TikTok-related activities in a month**

We are only asked about **time spent on TikTok**, which is the **recording of videos**.

So, total time on TikTok in a month:

$$
288 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Britany spends 288 minutes (or 4 hours and 48 minutes) on TikTok in a month.**
Let's break this down step by step to calculate the total cost for Angela's installation.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base installation cost**
The firm offers a **base installation** for **$129.00**, which includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 2 shelves
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

So, the **base cost of $129.00** covers **4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many items Angela needs**
Angela has:
- **6 mirrors**
- **2 chandeliers**
- **20 pictures**

She doesn't mention any shelves, so we'll assume she doesn't need them (or they are already included in the base package).

So, total items she needs:
- Mirrors: 6
- Chandeliers: 2
- Pictures: 20

---

### **Step 3: Compare with the base package**
The base package includes:
- 4 mirrors
- 1 chandelier
- 10 pictures

So, Angela is **over the base package** in:
- **Mirrors**: 6 - 4 = **2 extra mirrors**
- **Chandeliers**: 2 - 1 = **1 extra chandelier**
- **Pictures**: 20 - 10 = **10 extra pictures**

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the additional cost**
The firm charges **$15.00 per additional item**.

She has:
- 2 extra mirrors
- 1 extra chandelier
- 10 extra pictures

Total additional items = 2 + 1 + 10 = **13 items**

Additional cost = 13 × $15.00 = **$195.00**

---

### **Step 5: Add to the base cost**
Base cost = $129.00  
Additional cost = $195.00

**Total cost = $129.00 + $195.00 = $324.00**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $324.00**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

\text{Anthony's savings} = \text{Eva's savings} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
$$

So, **Anthony has saved $30.00**.

---

### Step 2: Find how much Roy saved

Roy has saved **40% more** than Anthony.

To find 40% of Anthony's savings:

$$
40\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.4 \times 30 = 12
$$

Now add that to Anthony's savings to get Roy's total:

$$
\text{Roy's savings} = 30 + 12 = 42
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{42}
$$

Roy has saved **$42.00**.
We are given a series of comparisons between how high each person can lift a mountain, and we're told that **Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch**. We need to find out **how high Naruto can lift a mountain**, in **feet**.

---

### Step-by-step:

Let’s define the lifting capacity in terms of **inches**, and then convert the final answer to **feet**.

We are told:

- **Pompei** can lift a mountain **1 inch**.
- **Saskay** can lift a mountain **12 times higher than Pompei**.
- **Kagiyami** can lift a mountain **4 times higher than Saskay**.
- **Naruto** can lift a mountain **10 times higher than Kagiyami**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate Saskay's lifting capacity

Saskay = 12 × Pompei  
= 12 × 1 inch = **12 inches**

---

### Step 2: Calculate Kagiyami's lifting capacity

Kagiyami = 4 × Saskay  
= 4 × 12 inches = **48 inches**

---

### Step 3: Calculate Naruto's lifting capacity

Naruto = 10 × Kagiyami  
= 10 × 48 inches = **480 inches**

---

### Step 4: Convert inches to feet

There are **12 inches in 1 foot**, so:

Naruto's lifting capacity = 480 ÷ 12 = **40 feet**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled during the first part of the journey**

Mason is traveling at a rate of **8 miles per hour** for **4 hours**.

$$
\text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled during the second part of the journey**

He then travels for another **6 hours** at the same speed of **8 miles per hour**.

$$
\text{Distance}_2 = 8 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add both distances to find the total distance**

$$
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = \boxed{80} \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **80 miles**
We are given:

- **3 kangaroos** travel across a highway in **18 hours**, all traveling at the **same speed**.
- We need to find how long it will take **4 turtles**, each traveling at **half the speed of a kangaroo**, to do the same trip.

---

### Step 1: Understand the total work (distance)

Let’s assume the distance of the highway is **D**.

Each kangaroo travels at a speed of **v**, so the total distance they cover is:

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
$$

But since we’re dealing with **combined effort** (3 kangaroos working together), we can think of this as a **work problem** where:

- Total work = distance = D
- Each kangaroo has a certain rate of work (speed)
- The total work done by 3 kangaroos in 18 hours is D.

So, let's define:

- Let $ v $ be the speed of one kangaroo.
- Then, the combined speed of 3 kangaroos is $ 3v $.
- In 18 hours, they cover:

$$
\text{Distance} = 3v \times 18 = 54v
$$

So, the total distance $ D = 54v $

---

### Step 2: Now for the turtles

Turtles travel at **half the speed of a kangaroo**, so their speed is:

$$
\frac{v}{2}
$$

There are **4 turtles**, so their combined speed is:

$$
4 \times \frac{v}{2} = 2v
$$

We want to find how long it takes them to cover the same distance $ D = 54v $.

Use the formula:

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
$$

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{54v}{2v} = 27 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{27} \text{ hours}
$$
We are given the following information:

- Kora made **20** clay dishes.
- Rory made **20 more** clay dishes than Kora.
- Jada made **twice as many** clay dishes as Rory.

We need to find the **total number of clay dishes** made by **Jada, Rory, and Kora** together.

---

### Step 1: Find how many dishes Rory made

Rory made **20 more** than Kora.

$$
\text{Rory's dishes} = \text{Kora's dishes} + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many dishes Jada made

Jada made **twice as many** as Rory.

$$
\text{Jada's dishes} = 2 \times \text{Rory's dishes} = 2 \times 40 = 80
$$

---

### Step 3: Add up all the dishes

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Jada} + \text{Rory} + \text{Kora} = 80 + 40 + 20 = 140
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{140}
$$

Jada, Rory, and Kora made **140** clay dishes together.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Erika already has in her purse.

---

### Step 1: Total cost of the new laptop
The laptop costs **$600**.

---

### Step 2: Trade-in value
If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price is reduced by **$200**, so the new price becomes:

$$
600 - 200 = 400
$$

So, she needs **$400** to buy the new laptop after the trade-in.

---

### Step 3: Additional money she has
Erika has:
- $150 from her part-time job
- $80 from her mom

So, total additional money she has is:

$$
150 + 80 = 230
$$

---

### Step 4: How much more does she need?
She now only needs an extra **$50** to buy the laptop.

That means the amount of money she **already has** (including what she has in her purse) is:

$$
400 - 50 = 350
$$

---

### Step 5: Subtract the money she has from other sources
She has already received $230 from her job and her mom. So, the amount she had **in her purse before** receiving that money is:

$$
350 - 230 = 120
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Erika has **$120** in her purse.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate total slices from large apples  
- Each **large apple** can be sliced into **5 pieces**.  
- Adam has **3 large apples**.  
- So, total slices from large apples =  
  $$
  3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ slices}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Calculate total slices from small apples  
- Each **small apple** can be sliced into **3 pieces**.  
- Adam has **5 small apples**.  
- So, total slices from small apples =  
  $$
  5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ slices}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Total number of slices  
Add the slices from large and small apples:  
$$
15 + 15 = 30 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### Step 4: Subtract the number of slices Adam eats  
Adam eats **15 slices**, so the number of slices left is:  
$$
30 - 15 = 15 \text{ slices left}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
$$
\boxed{15}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Milk production per cow**

The farmer gets **5 liters of milk per cow per day**.

---

### **Step 2: Current milk production**

He has **3 cows**, so the total milk he currently produces is:

$$
3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters/day}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Target milk production**

He wants to produce **25 liters of milk per day**.

---

### **Step 4: How much more milk does he need?**

$$
25 \text{ liters} - 15 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
$$

---

### **Step 5: How many more cows are needed to produce 10 liters?**

Each cow produces **5 liters/day**, so:

$$
\frac{10 \text{ liters}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

The farmer needs **2 more cows** to produce 25 liters of milk a day.
We are given:

- Patrick has **three glue sticks**.
- Each glue stick is **originally 12 millimeters long**.
- The **amount of glue left** in each stick is:
  - First: **1/6**
  - Second: **2/3**
  - Third: **1/2**

We are asked to find the **total length of the glue sticks that are not used**.

---

### Step 1: Find the amount of glue used in each stick

The amount of glue **used** is equal to the original length minus the remaining length.

#### First glue stick:
- Remaining: $ \frac{1}{6} $
- Used: $ 12 - \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 12 - 2 = 10 $ mm

#### Second glue stick:
- Remaining: $ \frac{2}{3} $
- Used: $ 12 - \frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 12 - 8 = 4 $ mm

#### Third glue stick:
- Remaining: $ \frac{1}{2} $
- Used: $ 12 - \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 12 - 6 = 6 $ mm

---

### Step 2: Add up the used lengths

$$
\text{Total used} = 10 + 4 + 6 = 20 \text{ mm}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{20} \text{ millimeters}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Total cost of the items
Gabriel wants to buy:
- A **car** for **$10,000**
- A **phone** for **$800**

So, the **total cost** is:

$$
10,000 + 800 = 10,800
$$

### Step 2: Total money Gabriel has
Gabriel has:
- $5,000 from working on weekends
- $200 from his brother

So, the **total money he has** is:

$$
5,000 + 200 = 5,200
$$

### Step 3: How much more money does he need?
We subtract the money he has from the total cost:

$$
10,800 - 5,200 = 5,600
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Gabriel still needs **$5,600**.

### **Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Craig has**

Craig has **2 twenty-dollar bills**:

$$
2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the cost of the squirt guns**

He buys **6 squirt guns** at **$2 each**:

$$
6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the cost of the water balloon packs**

He buys **3 packs of water balloons** at **$3 each**:

$$
3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add up all the costs**

$$
12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Subtract the total cost from the initial amount**

$$
40 - 21 = 29 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Craig has $29 left.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information

We are told:

- **Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.**
- **Peter has half as many dishes as Jack.**
- **Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store.**
- **Jack collected 60 dishes.**

We need to find the **total number of socks and dishes that Peter and Jack have together**.

---

### Step 2: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ J_s $ = number of socks Jack has
- $ J_d $ = number of dishes Jack has
- $ P_s $ = number of socks Peter has
- $ P_d $ = number of dishes Peter has

From the problem:

- $ P_s = 2 \cdot J_s $ (Peter has twice as many socks as Jack)
- $ P_d = \frac{1}{2} \cdot J_d $ (Peter has half as many dishes as Jack)
- $ J_d = 2 \cdot J_s $ (Jack has twice as many dishes as socks)
- $ J_d = 60 $ (Jack has 60 dishes)

---

### Step 3: Use the known value to find other values

We know:
$$
J_d = 60
$$
And from the clue:
$$
J_d = 2 \cdot J_s \Rightarrow 60 = 2 \cdot J_s \Rightarrow J_s = 30
$$

So:
- Jack has 30 socks
- Jack has 60 dishes

Now calculate Peter’s socks and dishes:

- $ P_s = 2 \cdot J_s = 2 \cdot 30 = 60 $
- $ P_d = \frac{1}{2} \cdot J_d = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 60 = 30 $

---

### Step 4: Find total number of socks and dishes

Total socks:
$$
J_s + P_s = 30 + 60 = 90
$$

Total dishes:
$$
J_d + P_d = 60 + 30 = 90
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{180}
$$

Peter and Jack have a total of **180 socks and dishes together**.
We are given the following information:

- Total number of students: **20**
- Number of students good at **math only**: **5**
- Number of students good at **English only**: **8**
- The rest are good at **both math and English**

---

### Step 1: Understand what we're being asked

We need to find how many students are **good at math** (including those who are good at both math and English).

---

### Step 2: Use the given data

Let’s define:

- $ M $ = number of students good at **math** (including those good at both)
- $ E $ = number of students good at **English** (including those good at both)
- $ B $ = number of students good at **both math and English**

From the problem:

- Students good at **math only** = 5
- Students good at **English only** = 8
- Students good at **both** = $ B $
- Total students = 20

So, total students can be expressed as:

$$
\text{Total} = (\text{Math only}) + (\text{English only}) + (\text{Both})
$$

$$
20 = 5 + 8 + B
$$

$$
20 = 13 + B \Rightarrow B = 7
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the number of students good at math

Students good at **math** include:

- Those good at **math only** = 5
- Those good at **both** = 7

So,

$$
M = 5 + 7 = 12
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{12}
$$

There are **12 students** who are good at math.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- Total concert time: **2 hours = 120 minutes**
- Each group requires:
  - **2 minutes** to get on stage
  - **6 minutes** to perform
  - **2 minutes** to exit
- **10 minutes** for an intermission

---

### **Step 1: Calculate total time per group**

Each group needs:

$$
2 \text{ (on stage)} + 6 \text{ (performance)} + 2 \text{ (exit)} = 10 \text{ minutes}
$$

So, **each group takes 10 minutes** of performance time.

---

### **Step 2: Subtract the intermission time from the total time**

Total time available for groups and performance:

$$
120 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes (intermission)} = 110 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Divide remaining time by time per group**

$$
\frac{110 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes per group}} = 11 \text{ groups}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{11}
$$

Vicki can have **11 groups** perform in the concert.
We are given:

- **Principal (P)** = $300  
- **Rate of interest (r)** = three-quarters of the original amount per year  
- **Time (t)** = 3 years  
- **Interest type** = Simple interest  

---

### Step 1: Understand the rate

The rate is **three-quarters of the original amount** per year. That means:

$$
r = \frac{3}{4} \times P = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225\%
$$

So, the **annual interest rate is 225%**.

---

### Step 2: Use the formula for simple interest

$$
I = P \times r \times t
$$

Where:
- $ I $ = Interest earned
- $ P $ = Principal = $300
- $ r $ = Rate = 225% = 2.25 (as a decimal)
- $ t $ = Time = 3 years

Now calculate the interest:

$$
I = 300 \times 2.25 \times 3 = 300 \times 6.75 = 2025
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate total amount after 3 years

$$
A = P + I = 300 + 2025 = 2325
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{2325}
$$

Brenda will have **$2325** after 3 years.
We are given:

- **40 white shirts**
- **50 floral shirts**
- **Half of the white shirts have collars**, so:
  - White shirts with collars = $ \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 $
  - White shirts **without collars** = $ 40 - 20 = 20 $

- **20 of the floral shirts have buttons**, so:
  - Floral shirts with buttons = 20
  - Floral shirts **without buttons** = $ 50 - 20 = 30 $

Now, we are asked:

> **How many more floral shirts with no buttons are there than white shirts with no collars?**

We already found:

- Floral shirts with no buttons = **30**
- White shirts with no collars = **20**

So, the difference is:

$$
30 - 20 = \boxed{10}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **10**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many trays the farmer needs
The farmer has **900 eggs**, and each tray holds **30 eggs**.

$$
\text{Number of trays} = \frac{900}{30} = 30
$$

So, the farmer needs **30 trays**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings
Each tray is sold for **$2.50**.

$$
\text{Total earnings} = 30 \times 2.50 = 75
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
The farmer will earn **$75**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Initial number of goats
- Farm X: 55 goats  
- Farm Y: 45 goats  

**Total initially:**  
$$
55 + 45 = 100 \text{ goats}
$$

---

### Step 2: Goats sold
- From Farm X: 10 goats sold  
- From Farm Y: Twice as many as from Farm X → $2 \times 10 = 20$ goats sold  

**Total goats sold:**  
$$
10 + 20 = 30 \text{ goats}
$$

---

### Step 3: Goats remaining
$$
\text{Total goats left} = 100 - 30 = \boxed{70}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **70 goats** are left in the two farms altogether.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Find out how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
James buys **2 pairs of shoes per month**, and there are **12 months in a year**.

$$
2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ pairs/year}
$$

### Step 2: Find the average cost per pair of shoes.
James spends **$2640 per year** on shoes, and he buys **24 pairs** in a year.

$$
\frac{\$2640}{24 \text{ pairs}} = \$110 \text{ per pair}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
James pays **$110 on average for each pair of shoes**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Given:
- **Price of a basket of green food** = $25  
- **Price of a basket of red food** = $18  
- You buy **3 baskets of green food and red food**.  
- For **each basket of red food**, you get **$2 off**.

We need to find the **total cost** of buying 3 baskets (some green, some red), with the discount applied only to the red ones.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many green and red baskets are being bought.

The problem says:  
> "you buy 3 baskets of green food and red food."

This is a bit ambiguous, but it likely means that **you buy 3 baskets total**, which are a mix of green and red. However, the wording is not clear on how many are green and how many are red.

But let’s assume the most logical interpretation:

> You buy **3 baskets in total**, and **some are green and some are red**.  
> But we don’t know how many are green and how many are red.

However, the next part of the question says:

> "how much will you have to pay in total if you get $2 off for each basket of red food?"

So we must assume that **all 3 baskets are red**, or at least **some of them are red**, and we need to calculate based on that.

Wait — actually, the original statement says:

> "If you buy 3 baskets of green food and red food..."

That suggests that **you buy 3 baskets in total**, and they are a mix of green and red. But the number of each is not specified.

But since the question doesn't specify how many are green and how many are red, and the only information we have is that you get **$2 off per red basket**, the most logical assumption is:

> You buy **3 baskets**, and **all of them are red**.

Because otherwise, without knowing how many are red, we can't compute the discount.

So let's proceed under that assumption:

---

### Step 2: Assume all 3 baskets are red.

- Price per red basket = $18  
- Discount per red basket = $2  
- So, discounted price per red basket = $18 - $2 = **$16**

Now, total cost for 3 red baskets = 3 × $16 = **$48**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**You will have to pay $48 in total.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many rooms need to be cleaned**
There are **90 rooms** in total.  
We need to clean **one-half** of them:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 90 = 45 \text{ rooms}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find out how long it takes to clean one room**
It takes **20 minutes** to clean one room.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total time in minutes**
$$
45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes per room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Convert minutes to hours**
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

$$
\frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 15 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
It would take **15 hours** to clean one-half of the rooms.
Let's break down the problem step by step:

---

### **Year 1:**
They build **12 homes**.

---

### **Year 2:**
They build **three times** the number of homes from Year 1.

$$
3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ homes}
$$

---

### **Year 3:**
They **count how many homes they have built so far** and then **double that amount**.

First, let's find the total number of homes built in the first two years:

$$
12 + 36 = 48 \text{ homes}
$$

Now, they double this number for Year 3:

$$
2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ homes}
$$

---

### **Total over three years:**

$$
12 + 36 + 96 = \boxed{144} \text{ homes}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{144} \text{ homes}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s assign variables to each person's age:

- Let **x** be your age.
- Your brother is **3 years older** than you, so his age is **x + 3**.
- Your sister is **2 years younger** than you, so her age is **x - 2**.
- Your mom's age is **one less than three times your brother's age**, so that's **3(x + 3) - 1**.

---

### Step 2: Write the equation for total age

The problem says:

> When you add all our ages, you get 87.

So:

$$
\text{Your age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} + \text{Mom's age} = 87
$$

Substitute in the expressions:

$$
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87
$$

---

### Step 3: Simplify the equation

First, expand and simplify the terms:

$$
x + x + 3 + x - 2 + [3x + 9 - 1] = 87
$$

$$
x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87
$$

Now combine like terms:

$$
(1x + 1x + 1x + 3x) + (3 - 2 + 8) = 87
$$

$$
6x + 9 = 87
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for x

$$
6x = 87 - 9 = 78
$$

$$
x = \frac{78}{6} = 13
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

You are **13 years old**.
We are given:

- **27 students**
- Each student needs **2 glue sticks**
- Glue sticks come in **packs of 8**
- Mr. Jackson can only buy **whole packs**
- He expects to have **some extra** glue sticks left over

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of glue sticks needed

Each student gets 2 glue sticks, so:

$$
27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many packs of 8 are needed

Each pack has 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, divide the total number of glue sticks by 8:

$$
\frac{54}{8} = 6.75
$$

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy whole packs, and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over, he must round **up** to the next whole number.

$$
\lceil 6.75 \rceil = 7
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Mr. Jackson will need to buy **7 packs** of glue sticks.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Given:**

- **Day 1:** The amount of water passing through the river is **4000 gallons**.
- **After a day of heavy rain (Day 2):** The amount of water **doubles**, so it becomes:
  $$
  4000 \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
  $$
- **On the third day:** The volume of water increases by **6000 gallons** from the previous day.

---

### **Step-by-step Calculation:**

- **Day 1:** 4000 gallons
- **Day 2 (after rain):** 8000 gallons
- **Day 3:** Increase by 6000 gallons from Day 2:
  $$
  8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons}
  $$

---

### **Final Answer:**

The **total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day is:**

$$
\boxed{14000} \text{ gallons}
$$
We are told:

- A **plague infects 10 people** initially.
- **Every day**, **each infected person infects 6 others**.
- We need to find how many people are infected **after 3 days**.

---

### Step-by-step Breakdown:

Let’s define:

- Let $ I_n $ be the number of **infected people on day $ n $**.
- Each infected person infects **6 new people per day**.
- So, each day, the number of new infections is $ 6 \times I_n $.

But wait — this is a **growth model**. It's not just adding 6 times the current number each day, because the **newly infected people also become infected on the next day**.

So this is a **geometric growth problem**.

---

### Let's model it step by step:

#### Day 0 (Start):
- Infected: $ I_0 = 10 $

#### Day 1:
- Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 new people.
- New infections: $ 10 \times 6 = 60 $
- Total infected: $ I_1 = 10 + 60 = 70 $

#### Day 2:
- Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 new people.
- New infections: $ 70 \times 6 = 420 $
- Total infected: $ I_2 = 70 + 420 = 490 $

#### Day 3:
- Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 new people.
- New infections: $ 490 \times 6 = 2940 $
- Total infected: $ I_3 = 490 + 2940 = 3430 $

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

After **3 days**, the total number of infected people is:

$$
\boxed{3430}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Rafaela's total tips

- **Number of customers:** 40  
- **Tip per customer:** $20  
- **Total tips for Rafaela:**  
  $$
  40 \times 20 = 800
  $$

So, **Rafaela received $800 in tips**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate Julieta's tips

- Julieta received **10% less** than Rafaela.  
- 10% of Rafaela's tips:  
  $$
  10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80
  $$
- So, Julieta's tips:  
  $$
  800 - 80 = 720
  $$

So, **Julieta received $720 in tips**.

---

### Step 3: Add their tips together

$$
800 + 720 = 1520
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Julieta and Rafaela received a total of $1,520 in tips altogether.**
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Total oranges Jennifer bought:** 12

2. **Oranges given to her three daughters:**
   - Each daughter gets 2 oranges.
   - So, 3 daughters × 2 oranges = **6 oranges**

3. **Oranges given to her only son:**
   - He gets 3 oranges.

4. **Total oranges given away:**
   - 6 (to daughters) + 3 (to son) = **9 oranges**

5. **Oranges remaining with Jennifer:**
   - Total oranges − Oranges given away = 12 − 9 = **3 oranges**

### ✅ Final Answer: **3 oranges**.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand Claire's rate
- **Claire earns 1 girl scout badge every month.**
- In **1 year (12 months)**, she earns:
  $$
  1 \text{ badge/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ badges}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Understand Amber's rate
- **Amber takes twice as long to earn a badge as Claire.**
- Since Claire takes 1 month per badge, Amber takes:
  $$
  2 \text{ months per badge}
  $$
- In 1 year (12 months), how many badges does Amber earn?
  - Each badge takes 2 months.
  - Number of badges = total time ÷ time per badge:
    $$
    \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ badges}
    $$

---

### Step 3: Understand Wendy's rate
- **Wendy earns three times the amount of badges as Claire in the same time frame.**
- Claire earns 12 badges in 1 year.
- So Wendy earns:
  $$
  3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ badges}
  $$

---

### Step 4: Find the difference between Wendy and Amber
- Wendy: 36 badges  
- Amber: 6 badges  
- Difference:
  $$
  36 - 6 = 30 \text{ badges}
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Wendy earns 30 more badges than Amber in one year.**
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much Paige raised.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the total time she baked**
- Baked from **1:00 PM to 6:00 PM**.
- That’s **5 hours**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the number of banana bread loaves baked**
- She can bake **2 banana bread loaves per hour**.
- Over 5 hours:  
  $$
  2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Find the number of slices per loaf**
- Each loaf is cut into **8 slices**.
- So, total slices:
  $$
  10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling all slices**
- Each slice is sold for **$0.50**.
- Total money raised:
  $$
  80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{40} \text{ dollars}
$$
We are given the following information:

- Gretchen has some coins.
- There are **30 more gold coins than silver coins**.
- If she had **70 gold coins**, how many coins did Gretchen have in total?

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ S $ = number of **silver coins**
- $ G $ = number of **gold coins**

We are told:
- $ G = S + 30 $
- $ G = 70 $

---

### Step 2: Use the given value for gold coins

Since $ G = 70 $, we can plug this into the first equation:

$$
70 = S + 30
$$

Now solve for $ S $:

$$
S = 70 - 30 = 40
$$

So, Gretchen has:
- 70 **gold coins**
- 40 **silver coins**

---

### Step 3: Find the total number of coins

$$
\text{Total coins} = G + S = 70 + 40 = 110
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{110}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

### **Step 1: Total number of burritos ordered**

George ordered:

$$
600 \text{ burritos}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Number of burritos given to students**

There are 50 students, and each student was given 10 burritos:

$$
50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos per student} = 500 \text{ burritos}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Number of burritos eaten by Mr. George**

Mr. George ate:

$$
20 \text{ burritos}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total number of burritos consumed**

Total consumed by students and Mr. George:

$$
500 + 20 = 520 \text{ burritos}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Number of leftover burritos**

Total ordered – total consumed:

$$
600 - 520 = 80 \text{ burritos}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{80}
$$

So, there were **80 leftover burritos** from the picnic.
We are given the following information about the bumper car rink:

- There are **12 red cars**.
- There are **2 fewer green cars than red cars**.
- There are **3 times as many blue cars as green cars**.
- There are **yellow cars**, and the **total number of cars is 75**.

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Red Cars
We are told:
> There are **12 red cars**.

So,
$$
\text{Red} = 12
$$

---

### Step 2: Green Cars
We are told:
> There are **2 fewer green cars than red cars**.

So,
$$
\text{Green} = \text{Red} - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10
$$

---

### Step 3: Blue Cars
We are told:
> There are **3 times as many blue cars as green cars**.

So,
$$
\text{Blue} = 3 \times \text{Green} = 3 \times 10 = 30
$$

---

### Step 4: Total Cars (Known)
We are told:
> The total number of cars is **75**.

So,
$$
\text{Total} = \text{Red} + \text{Green} + \text{Blue} + \text{Yellow} = 75
$$

Substitute the known values:
$$
12 + 10 + 30 + \text{Yellow} = 75
$$

Add the known numbers:
$$
52 + \text{Yellow} = 75
$$

Solve for Yellow:
$$
\text{Yellow} = 75 - 52 = 23
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{23}
$$

There are **23 yellow cars** in the rink.
We are given the following information:

- **Total number of books** among Sofie, Anne, and Fawn: **85**
- **Sofie has 25 more books than Anne**
- **Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn**

Let’s define variables for each person:

- Let $ A $ = number of books Anne has  
- Then, $ S = A + 25 $ (since Sofie has 25 more than Anne)  
- And, $ F = A + 12 $ (since Anne has 12 fewer than Fawn)

Now, the total number of books is:

$$
A + S + F = 85
$$

Substitute the expressions for $ S $ and $ F $ in terms of $ A $:

$$
A + (A + 25) + (A + 12) = 85
$$

Simplify:

$$
A + A + 25 + A + 12 = 85 \\
3A + 37 = 85
$$

Subtract 37 from both sides:

$$
3A = 48
$$

Divide by 3:

$$
A = 16
$$

Now find the number of books Fawn has:

$$
F = A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **Fawn has 28 books.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

We are asked to find the **weight of the carrots**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the weight of the sweet potatoes

The sweet potatoes weigh **2 times** as much as the potatoes:

$$
\text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times \text{Weight of potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the weight of the carrots

The carrots weigh **3 pounds fewer** than the sweet potatoes:

$$
\text{Weight of carrots} = \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{7} \text{ pounds}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

The seller gave **$4000** in dollar bills.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the change
To find the change, subtract the total cost from the amount given:

$$
4000 - 3500 = 500
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
The seller will give back **$500** in change.
We are given:

- Total monthly grocery cost: **$400**
- Madeline pays **60%** of the cost.
- The month is **four weeks** long.
- We need to find **how much Keenan spends per week**.

---

### Step 1: Find how much Madeline pays per month

Madeline pays 60% of $400:

$$
0.60 \times 400 = 240
$$

So, **Madeline pays $240 per month**.

---

### Step 2: Find how much Keenan pays per month

Total cost is $400, so Keenan pays the rest:

$$
400 - 240 = 160
$$

So, **Keenan pays $160 per month**.

---

### Step 3: Find how much Keenan pays per week

There are 4 weeks in a month, so:

$$
\frac{160}{4} = 40
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

### **Step 1: Total number of pizza pieces**

Tobias bought a pizza with **60 pieces**.

---

### **Step 2: Pieces eaten on the first day**

He ate **2/5** of the pizza on the first day.

$$
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
$$

So, he has:

$$
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces remaining}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Pieces eaten on the second day**

He ate **10 pieces** on the second day.

So, after the second day:

$$
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces remaining}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Pieces eaten on the third day**

He ate **7/13** of the remaining pieces on the third day.

$$
\frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}
$$

So, he has:

$$
26 - 14 = 12 \text{ pieces remaining}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Total pieces eaten so far**

Add up the pieces eaten over the three days:

- Day 1: 24 pieces  
- Day 2: 10 pieces  
- Day 3: 14 pieces  

$$
24 + 10 + 14 = \boxed{48} \text{ pieces}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Tobias has eaten 48 pizza pieces so far.**
We are given the following information:

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water

$$
\text{Cost of 3 bottles of soda} = 3 \times 3 = \$9.00 \\
\text{Cost of 2 bottles of water} = 2 \times 2 = \$4.00 \\
\text{Total cost} = 9 + 4 = \$13.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\$13.00}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find the total cost of 16 bolts**

Each bolt costs **$0.03**, and David wants to buy **16 bolts**.

$$
\text{Total cost} = 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48
$$

So, the total cost is **$0.48**.

---

### **Step 2: Subtract the total cost from the amount David has**

David has **$12.48**.

$$
\text{Money left} = 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00

Paul has **52 marbles**.

---

**Step 2: Add the marbles his friend gave him.**

His friend gave him **28 marbles**, so:

$$
52 + 28 = 80 \text{ marbles}
$$

Now Paul has **80 marbles**.

---

**Step 3: Calculate how many marbles he lost.**

He lost **1/4 of his marbles**. So:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \text{ marbles}
$$

---

**Step 4: Subtract the lost marbles from the total.**

$$
80 - 20 = 60 \text{ marbles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **60 marbles**.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand what is given**

- Isaias wants to make a **profit of $2000**.
- He sells chickens at **$50 per chicken**.
- He has **300 chickens** on his farm.
- He plans to sell **3/5 of them**.
- We are asked to find out **how much money he paid for the chickens he took to the market**.

---

### **Step 2: Find how many chickens he sells**

He sells **3/5 of 300 chickens**:

$$
\frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180 \text{ chickens}
$$

So, he sells **180 chickens**.

---

### **Step 3: Find total revenue from selling the chickens**

He sells each chicken for **$50**, so:

$$
180 \times 50 = 9000 \text{ dollars}
$$

So, he gets **$9000** from selling the chickens.

---

### **Step 4: Use profit to find cost price**

Profit = Revenue – Cost Price  
We know:
- Profit = $2000
- Revenue = $9000

So:

$$
2000 = 9000 - \text{Cost Price}
$$

Solving for cost price:

$$
\text{Cost Price} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for **$7000**.
We are given:

- Total glasses sold: **32**
- Julie sold: **14 glasses**
- The **boys** (Micah and Mitchell) sold an **equal number of glasses**

### Step 1: Find how many glasses the boys sold together
Total glasses = Julie's glasses + boys' glasses  
So, boys' glasses = Total glasses - Julie's glasses  
$$
32 - 14 = 18
$$

### Step 2: Each boy sold an equal number of glasses
There are **2 boys**, so:
$$
\frac{18}{2} = 9
$$

So, **Micah sold 9 glasses**.

### Step 3: How many more glasses did Julie sell than Micah?
$$
14 - 9 = 5
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **5** glasses.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the costs

- **Hair**: $400  
- **Manicure**: $ \frac{1}{4} $ of the hair cost  
- **Pedicure**: $ \frac{3}{4} $ of the manicure cost  

---

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the manicure

$$
\text{Manicure} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the pedicure

$$
\text{Pedicure} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
$$

---

### Step 4: Add up all the costs

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Hair} + \text{Manicure} + \text{Pedicure} = 400 + 100 + 75 = 575
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Iris spent $575 at the spa.**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the rope Sarah's friend wants to buy.**

Sarah's friend wants to buy a **20-meter** rope at **$2 per meter**.

$$
\text{Cost} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{\$/meter} = 40 \, \text{\$}
$$

So, Sarah will make **$40** from selling the rope.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the cost of the new rope Sarah wants to buy.**

She wants to buy a **new rope** that costs **$1.5 per meter**.

But how long is the new rope? The problem doesn't specify the length of the new rope, so we need to assume it's the same as the one she sold — **20 meters** (since that's what she has).

$$
\text{Cost of new rope} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{\$/meter} = 30 \, \text{\$}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how much money Sarah has left after buying the new rope.**

$$
\text{Money left} = \text{Total money from selling rope} - \text{Cost of new rope}
$$
$$
\text{Money left} = 40 \, \text{\$} - 30 \, \text{\$} = 10 \, \text{\$}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{10}
$$

Sarah will have **$10 left** after buying the new rope.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine Melanie's **current age**

We are told:

> In 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old.

So, her **current age** is:

$$
18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### Step 2: Let $ x $ be the number of years from now when her age will be **thrice her present age**

Her **present age** is 8, so **thrice her present age** is:

$$
3 \times 8 = 24
$$

So, we want to find how many years from now she will be 24.

Let $ x $ be the number of years from now when she will be 24.

Then, in $ x $ years, her age will be:

$$
8 + x
$$

We want this to equal 24:

$$
8 + x = 24
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = 24 - 8 = 16
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{16}
$$

In **16 years**, Melanie will be **thrice her present age**.

- **6 packets of chicken**, each costing **twice as much as a pack of bacon**.
- **3 packs of strawberries**, each priced at **$4**.
- **7 packs of apples**, each priced at **half the price of a pack of strawberries**.
- **Total budget**: **$65**

We need to find out how much money Kelly has **left** in her budget after buying all these items.

---

### Step 1: Find the price per pack of bacon

Kelly buys **5 packs of bacon** for **$10**.

$$
\text{Price per pack of bacon} = \frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the price per packet of chicken

Each packet of chicken costs **twice as much as a pack of bacon**.

$$
\text{Price per chicken packet} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the price per pack of strawberries

Given:  
$$
\text{Price per strawberry pack} = 4 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find the price per pack of apples

Apples are **half the price of strawberries**.

$$
\text{Price per apple pack} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost of each item

- **Bacon**:  
  $$
  5 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
  $$

- **Chicken**:  
  $$
  6 \text{ packets} \times 4 \text{ dollars} = 24 \text{ dollars}
  $$

- **Strawberries**:  
  $$
  3 \text{ packs} \times 4 \text{ dollars} = 12 \text{ dollars}
  $$

- **Apples**:  
  $$
  7 \text{ packs} \times 2 \text{ dollars} = 14 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### Step 6: Add up the total cost

$$
\text{Total cost} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 7: Subtract from budget to find remaining money

$$
\text{Money left} = 65 - 60 = \boxed{5} \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$5**
We are given the following information:

- Elaina's **final concert** is **twice as long** as her **usual concert**.
- She also performs a **15-minute encore** at the end of the final concert.
- The **total runtime** of the final concert (including the encore) is **65 minutes**.

We are asked to find the **length of her usual concert** in minutes.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ x $ = length of a **usual concert** (in minutes)

Then:
- Length of the **final concert** (without the encore) = $ 2x $
- Total time of the **final concert** (including the 15-minute encore) = $ 2x + 15 $

We are told this total is **65 minutes**:

$$
2x + 15 = 65
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve the equation

$$
2x + 15 = 65
$$
Subtract 15 from both sides:

$$
2x = 65 - 15 = 50
$$

Divide both sides by 2:

$$
x = \frac{50}{2} = 25
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{25}
$$

Elaina's usual concerts run for **25 minutes**.
Let's solve this step by step:

1. Argo starts with **200 toys**.
2. He gives **40 toys** to Alyssa.
3. He gives **80 toys** to Bonnie.
4. He gives **30 toys** to Nicky.

Now, let's add up the toys he gave away:

$$
40 + 80 + 30 = 150
$$

Now subtract that from the original number of toys:

$$
200 - 150 = 50
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **Argo has 50 toys now.**
Let's break this down step by step.

We are told:

- On **Tuesdays**, the shop makes **125** chimichangas.
- On **Wednesdays**, the shop also makes **125** chimichangas.
- On **Fridays**, the shop makes **twice as many** as on a Tuesday or Wednesday.  
  So, on **Fridays**, they make:  
  $ 2 \times 125 = 250 $ chimichangas.

Now, we want to find the **total** number of chimichangas made on **those three days**: Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday.

So, add them up:

$$
125 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 125 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 250 \text{ (Friday)} = 125 + 125 + 250
$$

$$
= 500
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **500 chimichangas**.
We are given:

- A singer has **50 microphones**.
- He wants to arrange them in **pairs**.
- After arranging as many pairs as possible, **20% of the microphones won't find any space**.

We need to find how many **pairs** of microphones he was able to arrange on the stage.

---

### Step 1: Understand what "20% of the microphones won't find any space" means

This means that **80% of the microphones were used to make pairs**, and **20% remained unpaired**.

So:

$$
\text{Number of microphones used in pairs} = 80\% \times 50 = 0.8 \times 50 = 40
$$

---

### Step 2: How many pairs can be made from 40 microphones?

Since a pair is 2 microphones:

$$
\text{Number of pairs} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{20}
$$

The singer was able to arrange **20 pairs** of microphones on the stage.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Birds nesting in the bushes  
Jerry counts **6 birds** nesting in the bushes.

So, that’s **6 birds**.

---

### Step 2: Birds flying overhead  
He counts **2/3 of that number** of birds flying overhead.  
That number is **6**, so:

$$
\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ birds}
$$

So, **4 birds** are flying overhead.

---

### Step 3: Groups of birds feeding  
He sees **3 groups of 8 birds each** feeding.

So:

$$
3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ birds}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add them all up  
Now we add all the birds together:

- Nesting: 6  
- Flying: 4  
- Feeding: 24  

$$
6 + 4 + 24 = 34
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **34 birds**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Total number of cookies baked**  
Lani baked **55 cookies**.

**Step 2: Cookies eaten by Lani**  
She ate **5 cookies**.

So, the number of cookies left is:  
$$
55 - 5 = 50 \text{ cookies}
$$

**Step 3: Cookies placed into jars**  
She placed the remaining **50 cookies** equally into **5 jars**.

To find how many cookies are in each jar, divide:  
$$
50 \div 5 = 10
$$

**Answer:**  
There are **10 cookies in each jar**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Find the total number of petals for orchids**

Joelle has **5 orchids**, and each orchid has **5 petals**.

$$
\text{Total petals from orchids} = 5 \times 5 = 25
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the total number of petals for daisies**

Joelle has **4 African daisies**, and each daisy has **10 petals**.

$$
\text{Total petals from daisies} = 4 \times 10 = 40
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find how many more petals the daisies have than the orchids**

$$
\text{Difference} = 40 - 25 = 15
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

The daisies have **15 more petals** than the orchids.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of plants**

Mrs. Smith has **100 plants** in total.

---

### **Step 2: Number of indoor plants**

One-fourth of the plants are indoor plants:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25 \text{ indoor plants}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Remaining plants after removing indoor plants**

$$
100 - 25 = 75 \text{ plants remaining}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Number of outdoor plants**

Two-thirds of the remaining 75 plants are outdoor plants:

$$
\frac{2}{3} \times 75 = 50 \text{ outdoor plants}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Number of flowering plants**

The rest of the plants are flowering plants:

$$
75 - 50 = 25 \text{ flowering plants}
$$

---

### **Step 6: Percentage of flowering plants**

$$
\frac{25}{100} \times 100\% = 25\%
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 25%** of the plants are flowering plants.
We are given the following information:

- A **whirligig** spins at **five times** the speed of a **thingamabob**.
- A **whatchamacallit** spins **eleven times faster** than a **thingamabob**.
- A **whatchamacallit** spins at **121 meters per second**.

We are asked to find how fast the **whirligig** spins.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s define:

- Let $ T $ = speed of thingamabob (in m/s)
- Then, speed of whirligig = $ 5T $
- Speed of whatchamacallit = $ 11T $

We are told that the **whatchamacallit** spins at **121 m/s**, so:

$$
11T = 121
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ T $

$$
T = \frac{121}{11} = 11 \text{ m/s}
$$

So, the thingamabob spins at **11 m/s**.

---

### Step 3: Find the speed of the whirligig

Whirligig speed = $ 5T = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ m/s} $

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{55} \text{ meters per second}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Identify the known values

- Ellen eats **2 carrots**, **1 salad**, and **1 yogurt** every day.
- The **salad costs $6**.
- The **yogurt is half the price of the salad**.
- In **one week**, she pays a total of **$11** for her daily meals.

We are to find: **How much does one carrot cost per day?**

---

### Step 2: Find the cost of the yogurt

The yogurt is **half the price of the salad**:

$$
\text{Cost of yogurt} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Let the cost of one carrot be $ x $

She eats **2 carrots** each day, so the cost of the carrots is:

$$
2x
$$

---

### Step 4: Total cost per day

Each day, she spends:

- $ 2x $ on carrots  
- $ 6 $ on salad  
- $ 3 $ on yogurt  

So, the **daily cost** is:

$$
2x + 6 + 3 = 2x + 9
$$

---

### Step 5: Total cost over one week

She pays **$11** in total for her goods. Assuming this is for **one week (7 days)**, we can write:

$$
7(2x + 9) = 11
$$

---

### Step 6: Solve the equation

$$
7(2x + 9) = 11 \\
14x + 63 = 11 \\
14x = 11 - 63 \\
14x = -52 \\
x = \frac{-52}{14} = -\frac{26}{7}
$$

This result is **not possible**, since the cost cannot be negative.

---

### Step 7: Re-evaluate assumption

The key is that **$11 is the total for one day**, not for a week.

Let’s try that instead.

---

### Step 8: Assume $11 is the **daily** total

Then:

$$
2x + 9 = 11 \\
2x = 11 - 9 = 2 \\
x = 1
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{1}
$$

Ellen pays **$1** for one carrot every day.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Hours worked per week**:  
   Mark works **8 hours a day** for **5 days a week**, so:  
   $$
   8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ hours/week}
   $$

2. **New hourly pay**:  
   He used to make **$10 an hour**, and his pay was raised by **$2 per hour**, so:  
   $$
   10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars/hour}
   $$

3. **Weekly earnings**:  
   Multiply the number of hours he works per week by his new hourly rate:  
   $$
   40 \text{ hours/week} \times 12 \text{ dollars/hour} = 480 \text{ dollars/week}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
Mark makes **$480 per week**.
We are told that Tasha made **$80** from **selling lemonade and mowing lawns**.

We are also given:

- Joe paid **$6** for each time he hired Tasha.
- In the **first week**, she mowed **Kamala's lawn three times as many times as Joe's**.
- In the **second week**, she mowed **Alba's lawn five times as many times as Joe's**.

We are to find out **how much she made from lemonade sales**.

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ x $ = number of times Tasha mowed Joe’s lawn in the first week
- Then, in the first week, she mowed Kamala’s lawn $ 3x $ times
- In the second week, she mowed Alba’s lawn $ 5x $ times

Joe paid **$6 per time** she mowed his lawn, so:

- First week earnings from Joe: $ 6x $
- Second week earnings from Joe: $ 6x $

So total earnings from **Joe** is:
$$
6x + 6x = 12x
$$

Total earnings from **mowing lawns** (from Joe, Kamala, and Alba) is:
$$
\text{From Joe} + \text{From Kamala} + \text{From Alba}
= 6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x)
= 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x
$$

So Tasha made **$54x** from **mowing lawns**.

She made a total of **$80** from **lemonade and mowing lawns**, so:

$$
\text{Lemonade sales} + \text{Mowing lawns} = 80
$$
$$
\text{Lemonade sales} + 54x = 80
$$

We need to find **x**.

But we don’t have more info about how much she earned from mowing lawns or lemonade. So let’s assume she only mowed Joe’s, Kamala’s, and Alba’s lawns, and **no other customers**.

Thus, the **entire $80** comes from **mowing lawns and lemonade**.

But since we already accounted for all the mowing (from Joe, Kamala, and Alba), and got **$54x** from mowing, then the rest must be from **lemonade**.

So:

$$
\text{Lemonade sales} = 80 - 54x
$$

Now, we need to figure out what **x** is.

Wait — we were not given any specific numbers for how many times she mowed, but we can **assume** that the **only** money she made was from **mowing lawns and lemonade**, and we were told that she made **$80 total**.

But we still need to solve for **x**.

Let’s look again at the problem:

> "Last month, Tasha made $80 from selling lemonade and mowing lawns."

That means:

$$
\text{Lemonade sales} + \text{Mowing lawns} = 80
$$

And we found that:

$$
\text{Mowing lawns} = 54x
$$

So:

$$
\text{Lemonade sales} = 80 - 54x
$$

To find **x**, we need to find a value such that **54x** is an integer and that **80 - 54x** is also a reasonable amount (i.e., non-negative).

Try small values of **x**:

- If $ x = 1 $: Mowing = $ 54 $, Lemonade = $ 80 - 54 = 26 $
- If $ x = 2 $: Mowing = $ 108 $, which is more than 80 → invalid

So the only possible value is:

$$
x = 1
$$

Then:

- Mowing lawns = $ 54 $
- Lemonade sales = $ 80 - 54 = 26 $

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{26}
$$

Tasha made **$26** from **lemonade sales**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are given:

- **Martin's weight** = 55 kg  
- **Carl’s weight** = Martin’s weight + 16 kg  
- **Christian’s weight** = Carl’s weight + 8 kg  
- **Harry’s weight** = Christian’s weight - 5 kg  

---

### Step 1: Find Carl’s weight  
Carl’s weight = Martin’s weight + 16 kg  
= 55 kg + 16 kg  
= **71 kg**

---

### Step 2: Find Christian’s weight  
Christian’s weight = Carl’s weight + 8 kg  
= 71 kg + 8 kg  
= **79 kg**

---

### Step 3: Find Harry’s weight  
Harry’s weight = Christian’s weight - 5 kg  
= 79 kg - 5 kg  
= **74 kg**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Harry weighs 74 kg.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much **profit** John makes on his car.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate total rental hours per month**

John rents his car **10 times a month**, and each time he rents it for **3 hours**:

$$
\text{Total rental hours} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total income from renting**

He gets paid **$25 per hour**:

$$
\text{Total income} = 30 \times 25 = \$750
$$

---

### **Step 3: Subtract the car payment**

His **car payment is $500** per month.

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Total income} - \text{Car payment} = 750 - 500 = \$250
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$250}
$$

John makes a **profit of $250** per month on his car.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define Variables

Let:
- $ M $ = number of notebooks Martha originally had
- $ J $ = number of notebooks Joseph had

We are told:

> Joseph had **3 times as many notebooks as Martha**  
So,  
$$
J = 3M
$$

---

### Step 2: Martha buys more notebooks

Martha buys **5 more notebooks**, and now has a total of **7 notebooks**.

So, we can write:
$$
M + 5 = 7
$$

Solve for $ M $:
$$
M = 7 - 5 = 2
$$

So, **Martha originally had 2 notebooks**.

---

### Step 3: Find how many notebooks Joseph had

From earlier:
$$
J = 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6
$$

So, **Joseph had 6 notebooks**.

---

### Step 4: How many more than Joseph does Martha now have?

Martha now has **7 notebooks**, and Joseph has **6 notebooks**.

So, the difference is:
$$
7 - 6 = 1
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{1}
$$

Martha now has **1 more notebook** than Joseph.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand what is given

- **Dijana rowed** a total of **50 miles**.
- **Anis rowed** **1/5 times more miles than Dijana**.

We need to calculate the **total distance** both of them rowed on that day.

---

### Step 2: Interpret "1/5 times more"

This phrase can be a bit tricky, but in common usage, it means:

> Anis rowed **Dijana's distance plus 1/5 of that distance**.

So:

$$
\text{Anis's distance} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \frac{1}{5} \times \text{Dijana's distance}
$$

$$
= 50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add both distances

- Dijana: 50 miles  
- Anis: 60 miles  

$$
\text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{110} \text{ miles}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Total number of cookies
Susan made **100 cookies**.

---

### Step 2: Her husband takes some cookies
Before Susan could package the cookies, her **husband snuck 4 cookies for himself**.

So, the number of cookies left to be divided among the nephews is:

$$
100 - 4 = 96 \text{ cookies}
$$

---

### Step 3: Divide the remaining cookies among 6 nephews
Now, Susan wants to **equally divide the 96 cookies** among her **6 nephews**.

We divide:

$$
96 \div 6 = 16
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Each of Susan’s nephews will get **16 cookies**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Pages read **yesterday**

- **Denise** read **10 pages**.
- **Daniel** read **13 pages**.

---

### Step 2: Pages read **today**

- **Denise** read **5 more than as many pages as Daniel read yesterday**.
  - Daniel read **13 pages** yesterday.
  - So, Denise read:  
    $$
    13 + 5 = 18 \text{ pages}
    $$

- **Daniel** **did not read any pages today**, so he read:
  $$
  0 \text{ pages}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Total pages read by each

- **Denise** total:  
  $$
  10 \text{ (yesterday)} + 18 \text{ (today)} = 28 \text{ pages}
  $$

- **Daniel** total:  
  $$
  13 \text{ (yesterday)} + 0 \text{ (today)} = 13 \text{ pages}
  $$

---

### Step 4: How many more pages did Denise read than Daniel?

$$
28 - 13 = 15
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the total amount of soup

Calvin has a pot that can fill:

- **4 adult bowls**, or  
- **8 child bowls**

This means the **total amount of soup** is equivalent to **4 adult bowls** or **8 child bowls**.

So, we can say:

- **1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls** (since 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls)

---

### Step 2: Determine how many bowls are needed for the family

Calvin is eating with:

- 1 adult (Calvin)
- 1 adult wife
- 2 children

That’s a total of **4 people**.

Each person eats **1 bowl**, so they need **4 bowls** of soup.

---

### Step 3: How much soup is used?

We know that:

- 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls  
- So, 1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls

Therefore:

- 4 bowls (for the family) = 4 × 2 = **8 child bowls**

So, **8 child bowls** of soup are used.

---

### Step 4: How much soup is left?

Originally, there was enough soup for **8 child bowls**.

After using **8 child bowls**, **0 child bowls** are left.

---

### Step 5: How many times can each child have a bowl from the leftover soup?

Since **no soup is left**, **each child cannot have a bowl of soup** from the leftover soup.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**0 times** — each child will not be able to have a bowl of soup from the leftover soup.
Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find the cost of the notebooks  
William bought **5 notebooks**, and each notebook costs **$1.50**.

$$
5 \times 1.50 = 7.50
$$

So, the notebooks cost **$7.50**.

---

### Step 2: Find the cost of the ballpen  
The ballpen costs **$0.50**.

---

### Step 3: Add the two amounts together  
Now, add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen:

$$
7.50 + 0.50 = 8.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
William spent **$8.00** in total.
We are given:

- Jo can make **4 small masks** with **2 yards** of material.
- Jo can make **3 large masks** with **2.25 yards** of material.

We need to find how much material is needed to make **20 small masks and 8 large masks**.

---

### Step 1: Find the amount of material needed per mask

#### Small masks:
- 4 small masks = 2 yards
- So, 1 small mask = $ \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 $ yards

#### Large masks:
- 3 large masks = 2.25 yards
- So, 1 large mask = $ \frac{2.25}{3} = 0.75 $ yards

---

### Step 2: Calculate total material for 20 small masks and 8 large masks

- 20 small masks = $ 20 \times 0.5 = 10 $ yards
- 8 large masks = $ 8 \times 0.75 = 6 $ yards

---

### Step 3: Add them together

Total material needed = $ 10 + 6 = 16 $ yards

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **16 yards** of material.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of movies
There are **9 Fast and the Furious movies**.

### Step 2: Determine how many times Deepa saw each movie
Deepa saw **each movie 3 times** in the theatre.

So, the total number of movies she saw is:
$$
9 \text{ movies} \times 3 \text{ times per movie} = 27 \text{ movies}
$$

### Step 3: Total cost
She spent a total of **$216** seeing all the movies.

### Step 4: Find the average price per ticket
To find the average price per ticket, divide the total cost by the number of tickets (which is the same as the number of movies she saw):

$$
\text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of tickets}} = \frac{216}{27}
$$

Now calculate:

$$
\frac{216}{27} = 8
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
The **average price per ticket** is **$8**.

Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Counts**

- **Blue shoeboxes:** 7  
- **Red shoeboxes:** 9

---

### **Step 2: How many shoeboxes does Tim use?**

He uses:

- **3 blue shoeboxes**  
- **1/3 of his red shoeboxes**

So, first calculate how many red shoeboxes he uses:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ red shoeboxes}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Subtract used shoeboxes from original counts**

- **Remaining blue shoeboxes:**
$$
7 - 3 = 4
$$

- **Remaining red shoeboxes:**
$$
9 - 3 = 6
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total remaining shoeboxes (optional)**

If you want the total number of shoeboxes left:

$$
4 + 6 = 10
$$

But the question asks specifically for **how many red and blue shoe boxes are left**, so we just need to report the final counts.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

- **Blue shoeboxes left:** 4  
- **Red shoeboxes left:** 6

So, **Tim has 4 blue and 6 red shoeboxes left.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

\frac{1}{5} \times 30 = 6 \text{ marbles}
$$

So, Dean gives **6 marbles** to Jamie.

---

**Step 2: Add the marbles given to Donald.**

He also gives **10 marbles** to Donald.

So, total marbles given away:

$$
6 + 10 = 16 \text{ marbles}
$$

---

**Step 3: Subtract the total given away from the original amount.**

$$
30 - 16 = 14
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **14 marbles** are left for Dean.
We are given:

- **Duncan's current age** = 60
- **Duncan's age eight years ago** = 60 - 8 = **52**
- **Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago.**

Let’s define:

- Let **A** be Adam’s **current age**.

Then, **Adam's age four years ago** is:  
$$
A - 4
$$

According to the problem:

$$
\text{Duncan's age 8 years ago} = 2 \times \text{Adam's age 4 years ago}
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
52 = 2(A - 4)
$$

Now solve for **A**:

$$
52 = 2(A - 4) \\
\frac{52}{2} = A - 4 \\
26 = A - 4 \\
A = 26 + 4 = 30
$$

So, **Adam is currently 30 years old**.

The question asks: **How old will Adam be in 8 years?**

$$
30 + 8 = \boxed{38}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **38**

We are given the following information:

- Benny threw **bologna** at balloons.
- He threw **2 pieces of bologna per red balloon**.
- He threw **3 pieces of bologna per yellow balloon**.
- He used a total of **58 pieces of bologna**.
- There were **20 red balloons**.
- We are to find how many **yellow balloons** there were.

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ r $ = number of **red balloons**
- $ y $ = number of **yellow balloons**

From the problem:
- $ r = 20 $
- Total bologna thrown = 58
- Bologna per red balloon = 2
- Bologna per yellow balloon = 3

---

### Step 2: Write the equation for total bologna

Total bologna thrown is:

$$
2r + 3y = 58
$$

Substitute $ r = 20 $:

$$
2(20) + 3y = 58
$$

$$
40 + 3y = 58
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ y $

$$
3y = 58 - 40 = 18
$$

$$
y = \frac{18}{3} = 6

### **Step 1: Determine how many miles Jon drives in a month**

Jon drives **100 miles per day** for **30 days**.

$$
\text{Total miles} = 100 \, \text{miles/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 3000 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how often Jon needs a tune-up**

Jon needs a tune-up every **1000 miles**.

So, we divide the total miles by the interval between tune-ups:

$$
\text{Tune-ups needed} = \frac{3000 \, \text{miles}}{1000 \, \text{miles/tune-up}} = 3
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**

Jon needs **3 tune-ups** in that time.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Tuesday
Bruce works **5 hours** on **Tuesday**.

$$
\text{Tuesday} = 5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 2: Wednesday
On **Wednesday**, Bruce works **twice** the time he worked on **Tuesday**.

$$
\text{Wednesday} = 2 \times \text{Tuesday} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 3: Thursday
On **Thursday**, Bruce works **2 hours less** than he did on **Wednesday**.

$$
\text{Thursday} = \text{Wednesday} - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total Hours
Now, add up the hours for all three days:

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} + \text{Thursday} = 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 \text{ hours}

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the unknown
Let **x** be the amount of allowance each girl received from their mother.

Since both Julia and Nadine were given the same amount, they each had **x dollars**.

So together, they had:

$$
x + x = 2x \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 2: Subtract the costs of what they bought

They spent money on:

- A cake costing **$11**
- 1 dozen balloons at **$0.50 for 2 balloons**

First, let's calculate the cost of the balloons.

- 1 dozen = 12 balloons
- $0.50 for 2 balloons → $0.50 × 6 = **$3.00** for 12 balloons

So total cost of balloons is **$3.00**

Then, they bought **2 tubs of ice cream**, each costing **$7**

So cost of ice cream = **2 × $7 = $14**

Now, total amount spent:

$$
\text{Total spent} = 11 + 3 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Set up the equation

They had **2x dollars** in total and spent **$28**.

So:

$$
2x - 28 = 0 \quad \text{(all the money was used)}
$$

Solve for x:

$$
2x = 28 \\
x = 14
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Julia and Nadine’s mother gave **each of them $14**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

3 + 5 + 6 = 14 \text{ pieces of fruit}
$$

---

### Step 2: Subtract the number of fruits Lola ate

Lola ate 2 pieces of fruit.

$$
14 - 2 = 12
$$

---

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{12}
$$

So, **12 pieces of fruit are left**.
We are given the following information:

- **16 boys and 22 girls** are playing **soccer**, so:
  $$
  16 + 22 = 38 \text{ students playing soccer}
  $$

Now, we are told that **each student only participates in one group**, so there is no overlap between the groups.

### Step-by-step total:

- Tennis: 6 students  
- Volleyball: 12 students  
- Soccer: 38 students  

Add them all together:

$$
6 + 12 + 38 = 56
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{56}
$$

There are **56 students in total**.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much money the class raised from the **profit** of selling lollipops.

---

### **Step 1: Find the total number of lollipops sold**

- There are **30 students**.
- Each student sold **10 lollipops** on average.

$$
\text{Total lollipops sold} = 30 \times 10 = 300 \text{ lollipops}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the cost price per lollypop**

- Each lollypop was bought for **$0.5**.

$$
\text{Cost price per lollypop} = \$0.5

- Each lollypop was sold for **$0.8**.

$$
\text{Selling price per lollypop} = \$0.8
$$

---

### **Step 4: Find the profit per lollypop**

$$
\text{Profit per lollypop} = \text{Selling price} - \text{Cost price} = 0.8 - 0.5 = 0.3 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Find the total profit**

$$
\text{Total profit} = \text{Total lollipops sold} \times \text{Profit per lollypop} = 300 \times 0.3 = 90 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$90}
$$

The class was able to raise **\$90** from the profit of selling lollipops.
Let's break this down step by step and calculate the total number of pets Larry has.

---

### Step 1: Cats
Larry has **3 cats**.

$$
\text{Cats} = 3
$$

---

### Step 2: Dogs
He has **3 times as many dogs as cats**.

$$
\text{Dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9
$$

---

### Step 3: Rabbits
He has **2 fewer rabbits than dogs**.

$$
\text{Rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7
$$

---

### Step 4: Fish
He has a fish tank with **three times the number of fish as rabbits**.

$$
\text{Fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21
$$

---

### Step 5: Gerbils
He has a collection of gerbils that is **1/3 the number of fish**.

$$
\text{Gerbils} = \frac{1}{3} \times 21 = 7
$$

---

### Step 6: Total Pets
Now, add up all the pets:

- Cats: 3  
- Dogs: 9  
- Rabbits: 7  
- Fish: 21  
- Gerbils: 7  

$$
\text{Total pets} = 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = \boxed{47}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Larry has 47 pets.**
We are given:

- A loaf of bread has **24 slices**.
- **Abby** eats **2 slices per day**.
- **Josh** eats **twice as much** as Abby, so he eats **2 × 2 = 4 slices per day**.

### Step 1: Total slices eaten per day
Abby + Josh = 2 + 4 = **6 slices per day**

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many years Martha has been collecting shells**

- Martha started collecting shells **when she turned 5**.
- By her **10th birthday**, she has been collecting shells for:

$$
10 - 5 = 5 \text{ years}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many months that is**

- There are **12 months in a year**.
- So, over 5 years, she has collected shells for:

$$
5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ months}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total number of shells collected**

- She collects **1 shell per month**.
- So, in 60 months, she has collected:

$$
60 \text{ shells}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{60}
$$

Martha will have collected **60 shells** by her 10th birthday.
We are told:

- Lana has **27 cups** of tea.
- She divides them into **3 rows**.
- In **each row**, she creates **equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups**.
- The **remaining cups** are used to brew **15 cups of cinnamon tea**.

We are asked: **How many cups of mint tea are in each row?**

---

### Step 1: Total number of cups = 27

She uses **15 cups** for cinnamon tea. So the remaining cups are used for chamomile and mint teas:

$$
27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups}
$$

These 12 cups are divided equally between **chamomile and mint teas** across the 3 rows.

So, **total chamomile + total mint = 12 cups**

---

### Step 2: Each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea.

Let’s say in **each row**, there are **x cups of chamomile** and **x cups of mint**.

So, in **one row**, there are:
$$
x + x = 2x \text{ cups}
$$

There are **3 rows**, so total cups in all rows (chamomile + mint) is:
$$
3 \times 2x = 6x \text{ cups}
$$

We already know that the total number of chamomile and mint tea cups is **12**:

$$
6x = 12
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
x = \frac{12}{6} = 2
$$

---

### Step 3: How many cups of **mint tea** are in each row?

Since each row has **x = 2 cups of mint tea**, the answer is:

$$
\boxed{2}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **2 cups of mint tea in each row**.
We are given the following:

- A **three-toed sloth** moves very slowly.
- He **only eats when he is up in his tree**.
- It takes him **4 hours** to go down the tree, pick berries, and climb back up.
- He picks the **same number of berries on each trip**.
- He wants to collect **24 berries in 8 hours**.
- We need to find the **least number of berries he can pick per trip**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the time per trip

Each round trip (down + up) takes **4 hours**, and during that time, he picks a certain number of berries.

Let’s call the number of berries he picks per trip = **x**.

So, in **4 hours**, he gets **x berries**.

---

### Step 2: How many trips can he make in 8 hours?

If one trip takes 4 hours, then in 8 hours, he can make:

$$
\frac{8}{4} = 2 \text{ trips}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total berries in 2 trips

He makes 2 trips, and picks **x berries per trip**, so total berries collected is:

$$
2x
$$

We want this to equal **24 berries**:

$$
2x = 24
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for x

$$
x = \frac{24}{2} = 12
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

The **least number of berries he can pick per trip** is:

$$
\boxed{12}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Initial amount of water in the pool**
- The pool has **10,000 gallons** of water.

---

### **Step 2: Fill the tank with half the amount of water in the pool**
- Half of 10,000 gallons is:
  $$
  \frac{1}{2} \times 10,000 = 5,000 \text{ gallons}
  $$
- So, the **tank is filled with 5,000 gallons** of water.

---

### **Step 3: The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day**
- We are told that the tank is emptied at **500 gallons per day**.
- We need to find out how much water is left after **6 days**.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate total amount of water used over 6 days**
- Water used in 6 days:
  $$
  500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons}
  $$

---

### **Step 5: Subtract the water used from the initial amount in the tank**
- Initial amount in the tank: **5,000 gallons**
- Water used in 6 days: **3,000 gallons**
- Remaining water in the tank:
  $$
  5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 \text{ gallons}
  $$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{2000} \text{ gallons}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to figure out **how many movies Colby can see** given his budget and the constraints.

---

### **1. Monthly Budget**
- Colby gets **$150 per month** for movies.
- He wants to **spend the rest of the month** on **movies**, including **popcorn** and **candy**.

---

### **2. Movie Tickets**

- **Friday or Saturday tickets**: $10 each
- **Other days**: $7 each

He already saw:
- 5 movies on **Friday or Saturday** → 5 × $10 = **$50**
- 8 movies on **other days** → 8 × $7 = **$56**

So far, he has spent:  
**$50 + $56 = $106**

Remaining budget:  
**$150 - $106 = $44**

---

### **3. Popcorn and Candy**

- Popcorn: $8 per tub
- Candy: $2 per box

He already had:
- 2 tubs of popcorn → 2 × $8 = **$16**
- 4 boxes of candy → 4 × $2 = **$8**

Total spent on popcorn and candy so far:  
**$16 + $8 = $24**

Remaining budget after popcorn and candy:  
**$44 - $24 = $20**

---

### **4. What’s left?**

He wants to **see a movie** tonight (which is a **Friday**) and also get **a popcorn and a box of candy** that night.

So, he needs to spend:
- $10 (movie ticket)
- $8 (popcorn)
- $2 (candy)

That’s **$20 total**.

Perfect! That uses up the remaining **$20** of his budget.

---

### **5. How many movies can he see?**

He already saw:
- 5 Friday/Saturday movies
- 8 other-day movies

That’s **13 movies**.

He can **see one more movie** tonight (Friday), which will be the **14th movie**.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**Colby can see 14 movies this month.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the calories per mini pastry**

- A **normal cinnamon roll** has **600 calories**, so a **mini cinnamon roll** has:
  $$
  \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ calories}
  $$

- A **normal blueberry muffin** has **450 calories**, so a **mini blueberry muffin** has:
  $$
  \frac{1}{3} \times 450 = 150 \text{ calories}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total calories for each type of pastry**

- Andrew bakes **200 mini cinnamon rolls**, each with **200 calories**:
  $$
  200 \times 200 = 40,000 \text{ calories}
  $$

- He also bakes **300 mini blueberry muffins**, each with **150 calories**:
  $$
  300 \times 150 = 45,000 \text{ calories}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Add the totals together**

$$
40,000 + 45,000 = \boxed{85,000} \text{ calories}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{85,000} \text{ calories}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find the **average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day**.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of Junebugs removed each day

- **Monday**: 39 Junebugs  
- **Tuesday**: Twice as many as Monday → $ 2 \times 39 = 78 $  
- **Wednesday**: Also twice as many as Monday → $ 2 \times 39 = 78 $  
- **Thursday**: 48 Junebugs  
- **Friday**: 57 Junebugs  

---

### Step 2: Add up the total number of Junebugs removed from Monday to Friday

$$
\text{Total} = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
$$

Let’s compute that:

- $ 39 + 78 = 117 $
- $ 117 + 78 = 195 $
- $ 195 + 48 = 243 $
- $ 243 + 57 = 300 $

So, **total = 300 Junebugs**

---

### Step 3: Find the average per day

There are **5 days** (Monday to Friday).

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total}}{\text{Number of Days}} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**The average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 60.**
We are given:

- A **bus** travels at **60 miles per hour** for **5 hours**.
- A **car** travels at **30 miles per hour** for **8 hours**.

We need to find how much **farther** the bus traveled than the car.

---

### Step 1: Find the distance each vehicle traveled

**Distance = Speed × Time**

#### Bus:
$$
\text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles}
$$

#### Car:
$$
\text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the difference in distance

$$
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{bus}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{car}} = 300 - 240 = 60 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{60} \text{ miles}
$$

The bus went **60 miles farther** than the car.

We are told that after adding the **bouncy balls**, the **total number of toys is 62**.

So, the number of bouncy balls is:

$$
62 - 48 = 14
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**14 bouncy balls** came in the tube.
We are given the following information:

1. The **combined age** of **Peter**, **Paul**, and **Jean** is **100 years**.
2. **Paul is 10 years older than Jean**.
3. **Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age**.

Let’s define variables for their ages:

- Let $ J $ be Jean's age.
- Then Paul's age is $ J + 10 $ (since he is 10 years older than Jean).
- Peter's age is $ (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10 $ (since Peter is the sum of Paul and Jean's ages).

Now, the total of their ages is:

$$
J + (J + 10) + (2J + 10) = 100
$$

Simplify:

$$
J + J + 10 + 2J + 10 = 100 \\
4J + 20 = 100
$$

Subtract 20 from both sides:

$$
4J = 80
$$

Divide by 4:

$$
J = 20
$$

So Jean is **20 years old**.

Then:

- Paul is $ J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 $
- Peter is $ 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 $

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Peter is 50 years old.**

  - Cost = 1000 pesos for the first 12 hours.

- **Option 2 (24-hour stay):**  
  - Cost = 1600 pesos for the full 24 hours.

- **Option 3 (Add-on after 12 hours):**  
  - First 12 hours: 1000 pesos.  
  - For every additional hour beyond 12, it costs **70 pesos per hour**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine how long Cameron stays**

- **Arrival:** 5 PM  
- **Departure:** 10 AM next day  
- **Total time:** From 5 PM to 10 AM is **17 hours**.

So, Cameron stays for **17 hours**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate cost using the add-on option**

- **First 12 hours:** 1000 pesos  
- **Additional hours:** 17 – 12 = **5 hours**  
- **Cost for additional hours:** 5 × 70 = **350 pesos**

**Total cost with add-on option:**  
1000 + 350 = **1350 pesos**

---

### **Step 4: Compare with the 24-hour option**

- **24-hour stay:** 1600 pesos

---

### **Step 5: Calculate savings**

- **Savings = 24-hour cost – Add-on cost**  
- Savings = 1600 – 1350 = **250 pesos**

So, the teacher has **842 bottles of apple juice for herself** after redeeming all coupons and giving out juice to the students.
Let's break down the charges step by step based on the information given:

---

### **1. Fixed Visit Fee**
Patty's Plumbing charges a **fixed visit fee** of:

$$
\$40
$$

---

### **2. Labor Cost**
- The labor rate is **\$35 per hour**, **or part thereof**.
- This means that even if the job takes **part of an hour**, you still pay for **a full hour**.
- The job took **2.25 hours**, which is **more than 2 hours** but **less than 3 hours**.

Since it's **"or part thereof"**, we round **up** to the next whole hour.

$$
\text{Labor hours charged} = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

$$
\text{Labor cost} = 3 \times \$35 = \$105
$$

---

### **3. Parts Cost**
- The parts cost is given as:

$$
\$60
$$

---

### **4. Total Charge**
Now, add up all the charges:

$$
\text{Total charge} = \text{Visit fee} + \text{Labor cost} + \text{Parts cost}
$$
$$
= \$40 + \$105 + \$60 = \$205
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$205}

Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much money James was out.

---

### **Step 1: Cost of the CDs before discount**

James gets **10 new CDs**, each costing **$15**.

$$
\text{Total cost before discount} = 10 \times 15 = \$150
$$

---

### **Step 2: Apply the 40% discount**

He gets a **40% discount** on the total cost.

$$
\text{Discount amount} = 150 \times 0.40 = \$60
$$

$$
\text{Discounted price} = 150 - 60 = \$90
$$

So, he paid **$90** for all 10 CDs.

---

### **Step 3: He sells 5 CDs for $40**

He doesn’t like **5 of them**, so he sells them for **$40 total**.

$$
\text{Money from selling 5 CDs} = \$40
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate total money spent and money earned**

- **Total money spent:** \$90 (original cost after discount)
- **Money earned from selling 5 CDs:** \$40

$$
\text{Net loss} = 90 - 40 = \$50
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**James was out \$50.**

### ✅ Final Answer:
Jen will earn **$34.00** if she sells everything.
We are given the following information:

- The **lake is 20 miles** long.
- James swims at a **pace of 2 miles per hour**.
- He swims **60% of the distance** first.
- Then he **rests for half as long as the swimming time** for that first part.
- Then he finishes the **remaining distance**, but at **half his original speed**.

We need to find the **total time** it took him to swim across the lake.

---

### Step 1: Find the distances

Total distance = 20 miles  
He swims **60% of the distance**:

$$
\text{Distance swum first} = 0.6 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
$$

Remaining distance:

$$
\text{Distance remaining} = 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 2: Time taken to swim the first 12 miles

His speed is 2 mph:

$$
\text{Time for first part} = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 3: Resting time

He rests for **half as long as the swimming time** for the first part:

$$
\text{Resting time} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 4: Time to swim the remaining 8 miles

He swims at **half the original speed**, so:

$$
\text{New speed} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ mph}
$$

$$
\text{Time for second part} = \frac{8}{1} = 8 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 5: Total time

$$
\text{Total time} = 6 \text{ (first swim)} + 3 \text{ (rest)} + 8 \text{ (second swim)} = 17 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{17} \text{ hours}

2. **Subtract the stickers she lost**:  
   She lost **7 stickers** during playtime.  
   So, we subtract:  
   $ 15 - 7 = 8 $

3. **Add the stickers she received later**:  
   Her teacher gave her **5 more stickers** for helping her classmates.  
   So, we add:  
   $ 8 + 5 = 13 $

### Final Answer:  
Jasmine has **13 stickers** at the end.
Let's break this down step by step to calculate Cayley's total commission.

---

### **Step 1: Find the commission per copy for each newspaper**

- **New York Times (NYT):**
  - Price per copy: $5
  - Commission rate: 10%
  - Commission per copy = 10% of $5 =  
    $$
    0.10 \times 5 = 0.50 \text{ dollars}
    $$

- **Wall Street Journal (WSJ):**
  - Price per copy: $15
  - Commission rate: 8%
  - Commission per copy = 8% of $15 =  
    $$
    0.08 \times 15 = 1.20 \text{ dollars}
    $$

---

### **Step 2: Multiply by the number of copies sold**

- **For NYT:**
  - 6 copies sold
  - Total commission = 6 × $0.50 =  
    $$
    3.00 \text{ dollars}
    $$

- **For WSJ:**
  - 10 copies sold
  - Total commission = 10 × $1.20 =  
    $$
    12.00 \text{ dollars}
    $$

---

### **Step 3: Add the commissions together**

$$
\text{Total commission} = 3.00 + 12.00 = \boxed{15.00}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Cayley will earn a total commission of $15.00.**
We are given the following information:

- **Deanna is 26 years old.**
- **Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.**
- **Marcus is half of Leo’s age.**

We need to find **Leo's age**.

---

### Step 1: Find Marcus's age

Marcus is **five years younger than Deanna**, and Deanna is **26**.

$$
\text{Marcus's age} = 26 - 5 = 21
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the relationship between Marcus and Leo

Marcus is **half of Leo’s age**. So,

$$
\text{Marcus's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age}
$$

We already found that Marcus is **21**, so:

$$
21 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Leo's age}
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
\text{Leo's age} = 21 \times 2 = 42
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{42}
$$

Leo is **42 years old**.
We are given the following information:

- **Total points scored by the team**: 45
- **Bahati scored the most points**
- **Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo**
- **Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar**

Let’s define variables for each person’s score:

- Let **A** = points scored by **Azibo**
- Let **B** = points scored by **Bahati**
- Let **D** = points scored by **Dinar**

From the problem, we know:

1. **B = A + 20** (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
2. **B = D + 10** (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)
3. **A + B + D = 45** (total points scored by the team)

---

### Step 1: Express all variables in terms of A

From (1):  
**B = A + 20**

From (2):  
**B = D + 10**, so  
**D = B - 10 = (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10**

Now substitute **B** and **D** in terms of **A** into the total equation:

**A + B + D = 45**  
→ **A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45**

---

### Step 2: Simplify the equation

$$
A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45
$$
$$
A + A + 20 + A + 10 = 45
$$
$$
3A + 30 = 45
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for A

$$
3A = 45 - 30 = 15
$$
$$
A = \frac{15}{3} = 5
$$

---

### Final Answer:

**Azibo scored 5 points.** ✅
We are told:

- The book is **1.5 inches thick**.
- The paper is **100 pages per inch** when stacked.
- Each **sheet of paper** is printed on **both sides**, with **one page on each side**.

---

### Step 1: Determine the number of pages per inch

Each sheet of paper has **2 pages** (1 on each side), and there are **100 pages per inch**.

So, the number of **sheets per inch** is:

$$
\frac{100 \text{ pages}}{2 \text{ pages per sheet}} = 50 \text{ sheets per inch}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate total number of sheets in the book

The book is **1.5 inches thick**, so the total number of sheets is:

$$
1.5 \text{ inches} \times 50 \text{ sheets per inch} = 75 \text{ sheets}
$$

---

### Step 3: Convert sheets to pages

Each sheet has **2 pages**, so the total number of pages is:

$$
75 \text{ sheets} \times 2 \text{ pages per sheet} = 150 \text{ pages}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{150}
$$

The book has **150 pages**.
We are given:

- **Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.**
- He works from **8:00 AM to 11:00 PM**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total time he works

From **8:00 AM to 11:00 PM** is:

$$
11:00 - 8:00 = 15 \text{ hours}
$$

Convert that into **minutes**:

$$
15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes

$$
\frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes per interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of reports stapled

He staples **30 reports per 15 minutes**, so over 60 intervals:

$$
60 \text{ intervals} \times 30 \text{ reports/interval} = 1800 \text{ reports}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{1800} \text{ reports}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out **how many minutes Kim actually slept on her bed that day**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the usual sleep schedule**

- **Usually sleeps at 10 p.m.**
- **Wakes up at 6 a.m.**
- So, **her normal sleep duration is:**

$$
6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 10:00 \text{ p.m.} = 8 \text{ hours} = 480 \text{ minutes}
$$

So normally she sleeps for **480 minutes**.

---

### **Step 2: What happened that day?**

She **woke up** that day **5 minutes earlier than usual**, so:

- Normally wakes up at **6:00 a.m.**
- That day, she woke up at **5:55 a.m.**

So, she **slept from 10:00 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.**

Now let’s calculate how long that is.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate time from 10:00 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.**

From **10:00 p.m. to midnight** is **10 hours**  
From **midnight to 5:55 a.m.** is **5 hours and 55 minutes**

Total time =  
$$
10 \text{ hours} + 5 \text{ hours } 55 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ hours } 55 \text{ minutes}
$$

Convert to minutes:

$$
15 \times 60 = 900 \text{ minutes} \\
+ 55 = 955 \text{ minutes}
$$

So, **she slept for 955 minutes** **on her bed**.

---

### **Step 4: Check if the sleepwalking affects the total time on the bed**

The problem says:

- She **woke up** that day (so she was awake for some time).
- She **sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.** — this is **23 minutes** of sleepwalking.
- But even during sleepwalking, she was still **on her bed**.

So the **23 minutes of sleepwalking does not reduce** the total time she spent on her bed.

Therefore, the **total time she was on her bed** is still **955 minutes**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{955}
$$

**Kim slept on her bed for 955 minutes that day.**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information

- Jonathan has **2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups**.
- He has **two dozen measuring cups**.
- He gifts **6 measuring spoons** to Pedro.

We are asked to find the **total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining** after giving away 6 spoons.

---

### Step 2: Find the number of measuring cups

- Two dozen = 2 × 12 = **24 measuring cups**

---

### Step 3: Find the number of measuring spoons

He has **2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups**.

So:

$$
\text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
$$

---

### Step 4: Subtract the spoons he gives away

He gives away 6 measuring spoons:

$$
\text{Remaining spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10
$$

---

### Step 5: Add the remaining spoons and cups to get total utensils

- Remaining measuring spoons: **10**
- Measuring cups: **24**

$$
\text{Total utensils remaining} = 10 + 24 = \boxed{34}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **34**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial number of beds and initial occupancy**

- The hospital has a **total capacity of 1000 beds**.
- Initially, **1/5 of the beds are occupied**.

$$
\text{Initially occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds}
$$

So, initially, the number of **unoccupied beds** is:

$$
1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ beds}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Patients admitted per day**

- **50 patients are admitted each day.**
- We are to calculate the total number of unoccupied beds **after 2 weeks**.

Since a week has 7 days, 2 weeks = **14 days**.

$$
\text{Total patients admitted in 14 days} = 50 \times 14 = 700 \text{ patients}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total number of occupied beds after 14 days**

We start with 200 occupied beds, and then **700 more patients are admitted**.

$$
\text{Total occupied beds after 14 days} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ beds}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total number of unoccupied beds after 14 days**

$$
\text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = 100 \text{ beds}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{100}
$$

There are **100 unoccupied beds** in the hospital after 2 weeks.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Total emails per day:**  
Robyn sends **16 emails** a day.

---

### **Step 1: Work emails**  
She sends **7 work emails**.

So, the **remainder** of the emails is:

$$
16 - 7 = 9 \text{ emails}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Emails to family**  
Two-thirds of the **remainder (9)** are to family.

$$
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ emails to family}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Remaining emails after family**  
Now subtract the family emails from the remainder:

$$
9 - 6 = 3 \text{ emails left}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Emails to her boyfriend**  
One-third of the **remaining 3** emails are to her boyfriend.

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \text{ email to her boyfriend}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Robyn sends 1 email to her boyfriend each day.**
We are given the following information:

1. **Aliya is 3 years old.**
2. **Shawna is three times as old as Aliya.**
3. **Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.**

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find Shawna's age

Shawna is **three times as old as Aliya**, and Aliya is **3 years old**.

$$
\text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find Shawna's father's age

Shawna's father is **five times as old as Shawna**.

$$
\text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{45}
$$

Shawna's father is **45 years old**.
We are told that:

- **Courtney** reported the audience size as **48 people**.
- **Kelly** said that Courtney **overstated** the number by **20%**.
- We are to find the **actual number of people** who attended the concert, assuming Kelly is correct.

---

### Step 1: Understand what "overstating by 20%" means

If Courtney **overstated** the number by 20%, that means the actual number is **less than 48**, and the difference between 48 and the actual number is **20% of the actual number**.

Let’s define:

- Let $ x $ be the **actual number of people** who attended the concert.
- Then, Courtney's report of 48 is 20% more than $ x $.

So we can write:

$$
48 = x + 0.2x = 1.2x
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

$$
48 = 1.2x
$$

$$
x = \frac{48}{1.2} = 40
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{40}
$$

So, if Kelly was right, the **actual number of people** who attended the concert was **40**.
We are told:

- Jordan carried **twice as many balls as Jason**.
- Jason carried **twice as many balls as Jeffrey**.
- **Jason carried 2 balls**.

Let’s work step by step to find the total number of balls.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many balls each person carried

- **Jason carried 2 balls.**
- **Jordan carried twice as many as Jason**, so:
  $$
  \text{Jordan} = 2 \times \text{Jason} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ balls}
  $$
- **Jason carried twice as many as Jeffrey**, so:
  $$
  \text{Jeffrey} = \frac{\text{Jason}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ ball}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Add up all the balls

$$
\text{Total balls} = \text{Jordan} + \text{Jason} + \text{Jeffrey} = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{7}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Day 1:**
- The pirates dug **10 holes**.

So, at the **end of Day 1**, there are **10 holes**.

---

### **Day 2:**
- They dug **13 holes**.

Total holes at the end of Day 2:
$$
10 + 13 = 23 \text{ holes}
$$

---

### **Day 3:**
- They dug **8 holes**, but then **filled in 2 holes** (to prevent falling in).

So, net change on Day 3:
$$
8 - 2 = 6 \text{ new holes}
$$

Total holes at the end of Day 3:
$$
23 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
$$

---

### **Day 4:**
- The island had **four times as many holes** as it did at the end of Day 1.

At the end of Day 1: **10 holes**

So, by the end of Day 4:
$$
4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
$$

We already had **29 holes** at the end of Day 3. So the number of holes dug on Day 4 is:
$$
40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{11}
$$

The pirates dug **11 holes on the fourth day** before finding the treasure.
We are told:

- Amora and Lainey each got **70 corn chips**.
- The third person (Collins) got **15 more** than the others.
- They wanted to share **equally**, but that wasn’t possible — only two people got equal amounts, and the third got 15 more.

Let’s break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many corn chips Collins got

Since Collins got **15 more** than Amora or Lainey, and they each got **70**, then:

$$
\text{Collins' amount} = 70 + 15 = 85
$$

---

### Step 2: Add up all the corn chips

Now we add the amounts for all three:

- Amora: 70
- Lainey: 70
- Collins: 85

$$
\text{Total} = 70 + 70 + 85 = 225
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{225}
$$

So, there were **225 corn chips** altogether.
Let's break this down step by step.

We are told:

- Jen has to pay **$400** for supplies.
- The **travel tickets** cost **50% more** than the supplies.

### Step 1: Find the cost of travel tickets
The travel cost is **50% more** than the supplies.

So:
$$
\text{Travel cost} = \text{Supplies cost} + 50\% \text{ of supplies cost}
$$
$$
\text{Travel cost} = 400 + 0.5 \times 400 = 400 + 200 = 600
$$

### Step 2: Answer the question
The question asks: **How much does travel cost?**

So, the answer is:
$$
\boxed{600}
$$

**Answer: $600**
We are given a system of equations based on the number of Pokémon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe. Let's define variables for each:

- Let $ A $ = number of Pokémon Alex has caught  
- Let $ S $ = number of Pokémon Stan has caught  
- Let $ D $ = number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught  

### Given:
1. **Total Pokémon caught**:  
   $$
   A + S + D = 339
   $$

2. **Alex has caught 5 more than Stan**:  
   $$
   A = S + 5
   $$

3. **Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe**:  
   $$
   S = 4D - 13
   $$

---

### Step 1: Substitute into the total equation

From (2): $ A = S + 5 $

From (3): $ S = 4D - 13 $

Now substitute both into the total equation:

$$
A + S + D = 339 \\
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
$$

Substitute $ S = 4D - 13 $ into this:

$$
(4D - 13 + 5) + (4D - 13) + D = 339
$$

Simplify:

$$
(4D - 8) + (4D - 13) + D = 339 \\
4D - 8 + 4D - 13 + D = 339 \\
(4D + 4D + D) + (-8 - 13) = 339 \\
9D - 21 = 339
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ D $

$$
9D = 339 + 21 = 360 \\
D = \frac{360}{9} = 40
$$

---

### Step 3: Find $ S $

Use equation (3):  
$$
S = 4D - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information

- Each **episode** is **20 minutes long**.
- There are **half as many episodes** in total as there are **minutes per episode**.

We are to find out how many **minutes** John will spend watching the entire show if he watches **every episode**.

---

### Step 2: Let’s define variables

Let:

- $ E $ = number of episodes
- $ M $ = number of minutes per episode = 20 (given)

From the problem:

> "There are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode."

So:

$$
E = \frac{M}{2}
$$

Substitute $ M = 20 $:

$$
E = \frac{20}{2} = 10
$$

So, there are **10 episodes** in total.

---

### Step 3: Calculate total time

Each episode is 20 minutes long, and there are 10 episodes:

$$
\text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{200}
$$

John will spend **200 minutes** watching the entire show.
We are given the bird's journey and need to find the **total distance between her northern and southern homes**.

Let’s break down the journey step by step, keeping track of **distance traveled in each direction**, and then determine the **net displacement** (i.e., total distance from start to finish).

---

### Step 1: First leg — South for 10 hours at 30 mph

- Time = 10 hours  
- Speed = 30 mph  
- Distance = speed × time = $ 30 \times 10 = 300 $ miles **south**

So, the bird is now **300 miles south** of her starting point.

---

### Step 2: Second leg — North for 2 hours at 18 mph

- Time = 2 hours  
- Speed = 18 mph  
- Distance = $ 18 \times 2 = 36 $ miles **north**

Now, the bird is **300 - 36 = 264 miles south** of her starting point.

---

### Step 3: Third leg — South for 5 hours at 22 mph

- Time = 5 hours  
- Speed = 22 mph  
- Distance = $ 22 \times 5 = 110 $ miles **south**

Now, the bird is **264 + 110 = 374 miles south** of her starting point.

---

### Final Answer:

The bird ends up **374 miles south** of her original home. Therefore, the **distance between her northern and southern homes is**:

$$
\boxed{374} \text{ miles}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many **individual brownies** Greta had left over from the entire day.

---

### Step 1: Initial Batch
Greta made **one dozen** cream cheese swirl brownies.

- 1 dozen = 12 brownies

So, she started with **12 brownies**.

---

### Step 2: Office Party
At her office, they sent her home with **½ a dozen** brownies.

- ½ dozen = 6 brownies

So, she received **6 more brownies**.

Now total brownies she has:

- 12 (original) + 6 (from office) = **18 brownies**

---

### Step 3: Surprise Party at Home
Her friends had **4 dozen** brownies waiting.

- 4 dozen = 4 × 12 = **48 brownies**

Now total brownies she has:

- 18 (from before) + 48 (from friends) = **66 brownies**

---

### Step 4: Brownies Eaten at the Party
During the party, **1 ½ dozen** brownies were eaten.

- 1 ½ dozen = 1.5 × 12 = **18 brownies**

So, **18 brownies** were eaten.

---

### Step 5: Brownies Left
Total brownies before eating: **66**

Brownies eaten: **18**

Brownies left:

- 66 − 18 = **48 brownies**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**48 individual brownies** were left over from the entire day.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Nani's age
We are told:
> Nani is **8 years old**.

So,  
**Nani = 8 years**

---

### Step 2: Brother's age
We are told:
> His brother is **twice his age**.

So,  
**Brother = 2 × Nani's age = 2 × 8 = 16 years**

---

### Step 3: Sister's age
We are told:
> Nani's sister is **25% younger than him**.

This means the sister is **75% of Nani's age** (because 100% - 25% = 75%).

So,  
**Sister = 75% of Nani's age = 0.75 × 8 = 6 years**

---

### Step 4: Total age of all three
Now we add up their ages:

- Nani: 8 years  
- Brother: 16 years  
- Sister: 6 years  

**Total = 8 + 16 + 6 = 30 years**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The total age of all three family members is 30 years.**
We are given the following information:

- **Total racquets to restring**: 12  
- **Types of strings** and their quantities:
  - **Synthetic gut**: 3 racquets  
  - **Polyester string**: 5 racquets  
  - **Hybrid string**: 4 racquets (half synthetic gut, half polyester)  

- **Time per racquet type**:
  - Synthetic gut: **15 minutes per racquet**
  - Polyester string: **22 minutes per racquet**
  - Hybrid string: **18 minutes per racquet**

---

### Step 1: Calculate total time for each type

- **Synthetic gut**:  
  $ 3 \text{ racquets} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes} $

- **Polyester string**:  
  $ 5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes} = 110 \text{ minutes} $

- **Hybrid string**:  
  $ 4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes} $

---

### Step 2: Add up all the times

$$
\text{Total time} = 45 + 110 + 72 = 227 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**It will take Andy a total of 227 minutes to string all the racquets.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Given:
- **Phone price**: $600
- **Number of people**: John, his 2 kids, and his wife → **4 people**
- **Each phone after the first 2 is half price**

So, we are buying **4 phones** in total.

---

### Step 1: Determine the cost of the first 2 phones

Since the first 2 phones are at full price:

$$
2 \times 600 = 1200
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine the cost of the remaining 2 phones (half price)

Each of these is half price:

$$
\frac{600}{2} = 300 \text{ per phone}
$$

So for 2 phones:

$$
2 \times 300 = 600
$$

---

### Step 3: Add the costs together

$$
1200 + 600 = 1800
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**John paid $1800 for all the phones.**
We are given:

- Carlton's team has **13 players**.
- Zeke's team has **7 more players** than Carlton's.

### Step 1: Find the number of players on Zeke's team
Zeke's team = Carlton's team + 7  
= 13 + 7  
= **20 players**

### Step 2: Add the number of players from both teams
Total players = Carlton's team + Zeke's team  
= 13 + 20  
= **33 players**

### ✅ Final Answer: **33 players** in total.
We are given:

- A **rectangular garden** with dimensions:
  - Length = 15 feet
  - Width = 10 feet

- Robert is building a **wooden fence** around the garden.
- He needs **2 wood slats for every foot of fencing**.

---

### Step 1: Find the perimeter of the garden

Since it's a rectangle, the **perimeter** is calculated as:

$$
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of wood slats needed

Robert needs **2 wood slats per foot** of fencing. So:

$$
\text{Total wood slats} = 2 \times \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times 50 = 100
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{100}
$$

Robert will need **100 wooden slats**.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of boxes**

Mrs. Harrington bought **12 boxes** of oranges.

---

### **Step 2: Boxes given to her mom and sister**

She gave **2 boxes to her mom** and **2 boxes to her sister**, so:

$$
2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes}
$$

So, she gave away **4 boxes**.

---

### **Step 3: Boxes remaining with Mrs. Harrington**

$$
12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Oranges in each box**

Each box contains **20 oranges**, so:

$$
8 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges per box} = 160 \text{ oranges}
$$

---

### **Step 5: She kept 1/4 of the oranges and sold the rest**

So, she **kept**:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 160 = 40 \text{ oranges}
$$

Therefore, she **sold**:

$$
160 - 40 = 120 \text{ oranges}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{120} \text{ oranges}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
We are told:

> India has **4 more than half** the number of states in the USA.

We need to find the **total number of states in both countries together**.

---

### Step 2: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ x $ = number of states in the USA  
- Then, number of states in India = $ \frac{1}{2}x + 4 $

---

### Step 3: Use known information

We know that the **USA has 50 states**.

So:
$$
x = 50
$$

Now, calculate the number of states in India:
$$
\text{India's states} = \frac{1}{2}(50) + 4 = 25 + 4 = 29
$$

---

### Step 4: Add them together

Total number of states in both countries:
$$
50 + 29 = 79
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{79}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find the total cost of the books**

- Dinosaur book: $13  
- Children's cookbook: $8  

**Total cost = 18 + 13 + 8 = $39**

---

### **Step 2: Determine how much more money Tyler needs**

Tyler has saved **$14** from his allowance.

**Amount needed = Total cost - Savings = 39 - 14 = $25**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how many hours Tyler needs to work**

Tyler earns **$5 per hour**.

**Hours needed = Amount needed ÷ Earnings per hour = 25 ÷ 5 = 5 hours**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Tyler needs to work for 5 hours.**
We are told:

- Richard, Jerry, and Robert are sharing **60 cherries**.
- **Robert has 30 cherries**.
- **Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard**.
- We are asked: **How many more cherries does Robert have than Jerry?**

---

### Step 1: Find how many cherries Richard has.

We know:
- Robert has **30 cherries**.
- Robert has **10 more** than Richard.

So:
$$
\text{Richard's cherries} = \text{Robert's cherries} - 10 = 30 - 10 = 20
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many cherries Jerry has.

Total cherries = 60  
Robert has 30  
Richard has 20  
So Jerry has:
$$
60 - 30 - 20 = 10
$$

---

### Step 3: How many more cherries does Robert have than Jerry?

$$
30 - 10 = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Define Variables**

Let:
- $ G_S $ = number of gingerbread boxes sold on **Saturday**
- $ A_S $ = number of apple pie boxes sold on **Saturday**
- $ G_U $ = number of gingerbread boxes sold on **Sunday**
- $ A_U $ = number of apple pie boxes sold on **Sunday**

We are told:

- On **Saturday**, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and **4 fewer** boxes of apple pie than on Sunday.
- On **Sunday**, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday, and 15 boxes of apple pie.

---

### **Step 2: Use the Information to Write Equations**

From the problem:

1. $ G_S = 10 $
2. $ A_S = A_U - 4 $
3. $ G_U = G_S + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15 $
4. $ A_U = 15 $

Now plug in known values:

- From (2): $ A_S = 15 - 4 = 11 $
- From (3): $ G_U = 15 $
- From (4): $ A_U = 15 $

So we now have:
- Saturday: $ G_S = 10 $, $ A_S = 11 $
- Sunday: $ G_U = 15 $, $ A_U = 15 $

---

### **Step 3: Calculate Total Sales**

Gingerbread price = $6 per box  
Apple pie price = $15 per box

**Total gingerbread sales:**
$$
(10 + 15) \times 6 = 25 \times 6 = 150
$$

**Total apple pie sales:**
$$
(11 + 15) \times 15 = 26 \times 15 = 390
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add Up for Total Earnings**

### **Step 1: Determine how much sunscreen Pamela uses per day**

- She applies **1 ounce of sunscreen every hour** she is outside.
- She is outside **4 hours a day**.
  
So, each day she uses:
$$
4 \text{ hours/day} \times 1 \text{ ounce/hour} = 4 \text{ ounces/day}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how much sunscreen she uses over 8 days**

- She is outside **4 hours/day** for **8 days**.

Total sunscreen used:
$$
4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine how many 8-ounce bottles she needs**

Each bottle contains **8 ounces**.

To find out how many bottles she needs:
$$
\frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Pamela will need to pack **4 bottles** of sunscreen.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Given:
- The **blue car** costs **$100**.
- The **red car** is **40% cheaper** than the blue car.

---

### Step 1: Find the price of the red car

If the red car is **40% cheaper** than the blue car, that means it costs **60% of the blue car's price** (because 100% - 40% = 60%).

So:

$$
\text{Price of red car} = 60\% \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60
$$

---

### Step 2: Add the prices of both cars

$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{Blue car} + \text{Red car} = 100 + 60 = 160
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Both cars cost $160 in total.**
We are given:

- **Emil is currently 19 years old.**
- When Emil turns **24**, he will be:
  - **Half the age of his dad**.
  - **Twice as old as his brother**.

We need to find:  
**The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now.**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ D $ = current age of Emil's **dad**
- $ B $ = current age of Emil's **brother**

---

### Step 2: Use the information about the future (when Emil is 24)

When Emil is **24**, that will be in:

$$
24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years}
$$

So, in 5 years:

- Emil's age = 24
- Dad's age = $ D + 5 $
- Brother's age = $ B + 5 $

Now, we are told:

> When Emil is 24, he will be **half the age of his dad**.

So:

$$
24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
48 = D + 5 \Rightarrow D = 43
$$

So, **Dad is currently 43 years old**.

---

Next, we're also told:

> When Emil is 24, he will be **twice as old as his brother**.

So:

$$
24 = 2(B + 5)
$$

Divide both sides by 2:

$$
12 = B + 5 \Rightarrow B = 7
$$

So, **Brother is currently 7 years old**.

---

### Step 3: Find the sum of the ages of the dad and the brother now

$$
\text{Sum} = D + B = 43 + 7 = \boxed{50}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: $\boxed{50}$
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Beads from Adrianne's mother  
Adrianne's mother gave her **20** metallic beads.

---

### Step 2: Beads from Adrianne's sister  
Her sister gave her **ten more beads than her mother**.  
So, the sister gave:  
$$
20 + 10 = 30 \text{ beads}
$$

---

### Step 3: Beads from Adrianne's friend  
Her friend gave her **twice as many as her mother** gave.  
So, the friend gave:  
$$
2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ beads}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total number of beads  
Now, add all the beads together:

$$
20 \text{ (mother)} + 30 \text{ (sister)} + 40 \text{ (friend)} = 90 \text{ beads}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Adrianne had 90 beads altogether.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Amount caught on Thursday**
Joe caught **3 pounds** of crawfish on Thursday.

---

### **Step 2: Amount caught on Friday**
He caught **4 times** the amount he caught on Thursday:

$$
4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Amount caught on Saturday**
He caught **half** of his Friday catch:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total amount caught over the three days**
Add up the amounts from each day:

$$
3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Number of servings**
Each serving is **3 pounds**, so to find how many servings he has:

$$
\frac{21}{3} = 7 \text{ servings}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 7 servings**.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of students
Mr. Roper's class has **30 students**.

---

### Step 2: Football players
20% of the class are football players.

$$
20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ students}
$$

So, **6 students** are football players.

---

### Step 3: Remaining students (not football players)
$$
30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students}
$$

---

### Step 4: Cheerleaders or part of band
Out of the remaining 24 students, **25%** are cheerleaders or part of the band.

$$
25\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students}
$$

So, **6 students** are cheerleaders or part of the band.

---

### Step 5: Total students leaving early
The three groups that need to leave early are:
- Football players: **6**
- Cheerleaders or band: **6**

So, total number of students leaving early is:

$$
6 + 6 = \boxed{12}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **12 students** are leaving early.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information

- **Charlie's boots are five times the size of Sophie's.**
- **Sophie wears size 5 boots.**

So, if Sophie's shoe size is **5**, then Charlie's shoe size is:

$$
\text{Charlie's size} = 5 \times \text{Sophie's size} = 5 \times 5 = 25
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the average shoe size

The average shoe size for the two people is:

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sophie's size} + \text{Charlie's size}}{2} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{15}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the flower bed dimensions**
- The flower bed is **111 feet long**.
- Each flower **grows 12 inches wide**, which is **1 foot** wide.
- There needs to be **1.5 feet of space between each plant**.

So, each **plant and the space after it** takes up:

$$
1 \text{ (flower width)} + 1.5 \text{ (space between plants)} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### **Step 2: How many plants can fit in the flower bed?**

We divide the total length of the flower bed by the space per plant:

$$
\frac{111}{2.5} = 44.4
$$

Since we can't have a fraction of a plant, we take the **floor** of that value:

$$
\text{Maximum number of plants} = 44
$$

But Pat **already owns 17 flowers**, so she needs to buy:

$$
44 - 17 = 27 \text{ more plants}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Cost of the plants**

Each plant costs **$6**, so:

$$
27 \times 6 = 162
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $162**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

**Step 1:** Find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in one day.

Edgar eats **18 pretzels a day**, and his brother eats **½ as many**.

So, the brother eats:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9 \text{ pretzels per day}
$$

---

**Step 2:** Find out how many pretzels the brother eats in one week.

There are **7 days in a week**, so:

$$
9 \text{ pretzels/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 63 \text{ pretzels}
$$

---

**Final Answer:**  
His brother eats **63 pretzels in a week**. ✅
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets.

---

### Step 1: Determine the number of each plant per basket
- **Petunias per basket**: 3  
- **Sweet potato vines per basket**: 2  

---

### Step 2: Find the cost per plant
- **Petunia cost**: $3.00 each  
- **Sweet potato vine cost**: $2.50 each  

---

### Step 3: Calculate the cost per basket
We calculate the total cost for one basket:

$$
\text{Cost per basket} = (3 \times 3.00) + (2 \times 2.50)
$$

$$
= 9.00 + 5.00 = 14.00
$$

So, **one basket costs $14.00**.

---

### Step 4: Multiply by the number of baskets
Katherine has **5 baskets**, so:

$$
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 14.00 = 70.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Katherine will spend $70.00** filling all 5 hanging baskets.
We are given:

- A **30-pound bag of soil**.
- Each **rose** needs **1 pound**.
- Each **carnation** needs **1.5 pounds**.
- Each **sunflower** needs **3 pounds**.
- They plant **4 sunflowers** and **10 carnations**.

We need to find out **how many roses** they can plant with the remaining soil.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total soil used by sunflowers
Each sunflower uses 3 pounds, and they plant 4:

$$
4 \text{ sunflowers} \times 3 \text{ pounds/sunflower} = 12 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total soil used by carnations
Each carnation uses 1.5 pounds, and they plant 10:

$$
10 \text{ carnations} \times 1.5 \text{ pounds/carnation} = 15 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total soil used so far
$$
12 \text{ (sunflowers)} + 15 \text{ (carnations)} = 27 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 4: Remaining soil for roses
Total soil is 30 pounds, so:

$$
30 - 27 = 3 \text{ pounds left}
$$

---

### Step 5: How many roses can be planted with 3 pounds?
Each rose needs 1 pound, so:

$$
3 \div 1 = 3 \text{ roses}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**They can plant 3 roses.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Find out how much Jessica saves per month for shoes.**

Jessica earns **$2,000** a month and sets aside **25%** of that for shoes.

$$
25\% \text{ of } \$2,000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = \$500 \text{ per month}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how much she saves in a year.**

There are **12 months** in a year.

$$
\$500 \text{ per month} \times 12 = \$6,000 \text{ per year}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy.**

Each pair of shoes costs **$1,000**.

$$
\frac{\$6,000}{\$1,000} = 6 \text{ pairs of shoes}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Jessica can buy **6 pairs of shoes** in a year.
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**

- **Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute.**
- **She can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes.**
- We need to find out how long it will take her to **peel and cook 90 shrimp**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine the rate of each task**

#### **Peeling rate:**
- Emily peels **6 shrimp per minute**.

#### **Sautéing rate:**
- She can sauté **30 shrimp in 10 minutes**, so that’s:
  $$
  \frac{30}{10} = 3 \text{ shrimp per minute}
  $$

So, she can **peel 6 shrimp per minute** and **sauté 3 shrimp per minute**.

---

### **Step 3: Total number of shrimp to process**

We need to **peel and cook 90 shrimp**.

This means:

- **Peel 90 shrimp**
- **Sauté 90 shrimp**

But we have to be careful — the same shrimp are being peeled and then cooked. So the **total time** is determined by the **longer of the two tasks** (peeling or sautéing), because she can’t start cooking until the shrimp are peeled.

So we need to figure out how long it takes for both tasks, considering that she can only do one at a time (assuming she can't do both at once).

---

### **Step 4: Time to peel 90 shrimp**

- Peeling rate: 6 shrimp/minute
- Time to peel 90 shrimp:
  $$
  \frac{90}{6} = 15 \text{ minutes}
  $$

---

### **Step 5: Time to sauté 90 shrimp**

- Sautéing rate: 3 shrimp/minute
- Time to sauté 90 shrimp:
  $$
  \frac{90}{3} = 30 \text{ minutes}
  $$

---

### **Step 6: Total time required**

Since she has to **first peel** the shrimp and then **sauté** them, the total time is the **sum** of both times:

$$
15 \text{ minutes (peeling)} + 30 \text{ minutes (sautéing)} = \boxed{45 \text{ minutes}}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 45 minutes**
We are given the following information:

- The **air conditioner cools** the room at:
  - **2 degrees per hour on low**
  - **3 degrees per hour on high**
- The **room warms up** at **2 degrees per hour** when the air conditioner is **not running**.
- The **air conditioner ran**:
  - **Low for 3 hours**
  - **High for 4 hours**
  - **Off for 2 hours**

We are to find how many **degrees lower than the starting temperature** the final temperature was.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total cooling from the air conditioner

- **Low mode**: 3 hours × 2 degrees/hour = **6 degrees cooled**
- **High mode**: 4 hours × 3 degrees/hour = **12 degrees cooled**

So, total cooling from the AC = **6 + 12 = 18 degrees**

---

### Step 2: Calculate the warming during the time the AC was off

- The AC was **off for 2 hours**
- The room **warmed up at 2 degrees/hour** during this time
- So, warming = 2 hours × 2 degrees/hour = **4 degrees**

---

### Step 3: Net change in temperature

- Cooling = 18 degrees
- Warming = 4 degrees

Net change = 18 (cooling) − 4 (warming) = **14 degrees**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

The final temperature was **14 degrees lower** than the starting temperature.
We are given the following information:

- **Comet Halley** orbits the Sun every **75 years**.
- **Bill's dad** saw the comet when he was **30 years old**.
- **Bill** saw the comet a **second time** when he was **three times the age his father was when he saw the comet**.
- We are to find: **How old was Bill when he saw the comet for the first time?**

---

### Step 1: Understand the timeline

Let’s denote:

- Let $ D $ be the age of **Bill's dad** when he first saw the comet.  
  From the problem, we know that:
  $$
  D = 30
  $$

- The **comet returns every 75 years**, so if Bill's dad saw it at age 30, then the next time it appears is in 75 years.

- So, **Bill's dad will see the comet again at age 30 + 75 = 65**.

- Now, the problem says:  
  > Bill saw the comet a second time when he was **three times the age his father was when he saw the comet**.

So, when Bill saw the comet the **second time**, he was **three times the age his father was when he first saw the comet**.

That is:
$$
\text{Bill's age at second comet} = 3 \times 30 = 90
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the difference in ages between the two comet sightings

From above, we now know:

- Bill was **90 years old** when he saw the comet the **second time**.
- He was **x years old** when he saw the comet the **first time**.

The time between the two comet sightings is **75 years** (since the comet comes back every 75 years).

So:
$$
\text{Age difference} = 90 - x = 75
$$

Solve for $ x $:
$$
x = 90 - 75 = 15
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{15}
$$

**Bill was 15 years old when he first saw the comet.**
Let's break down how many checks Buford writes each month and then multiply by 12 (months in a year).

---

### 1. **Electric bill**  
- **Once per month**  
- **Checks per year**: 12

---

### 2. **Gas bill**  
- **Once per month**  
- **Checks per year**: 12

---

### 3. **Church checks**  
- **Twice per month**  
- **Checks per year**: 2 × 12 = **24**

---

### 4. **Pest and lawn service**  
- **Quarterly** (once every 3 months)  
- **Checks per year**: 4 (since 12 ÷ 3 = 4)

---

### Now, add them all up:

- Electric: 12  
- Gas: 12  
- Church: 24  
- Pest and lawn: 4  

**Total checks per year** = 12 + 12 + 24 + 4 = **52**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **52 checks per year**.
We are given the following information about two planes at an airport:

---

### **First Plane:**
- Flies multiple times a day.
- Goes to **Greece** for **three-quarters** of its flights.
- The remaining **one-quarter** of its flights are split **equally** between **France** and **Germany**.

So, if the first plane makes $ x $ flights in a day:
- Flights to Greece: $ \frac{3}{4}x $
- Remaining flights: $ \frac{1}{4}x $
- Flights to France: $ \frac{1}{8}x $
- Flights to Germany: $ \frac{1}{8}x $

---

### **Second Plane:**
- Flies **only to Poland**.
- It makes **44 trips** per day.
- These 44 trips are **half** the number of trips made by the first plane in a day.

Let’s denote the number of flights the **first plane** makes in a day as $ x $.  
Then, the second plane makes $ \frac{1}{2}x = 44 $ flights.

Solve for $ x $:

$$
\frac{1}{2}x = 44 \Rightarrow x = 88
$$

So, the **first plane** makes **88 flights** in a day.

---

### **Now find the number of flights to France:**

From earlier:
- Flights to France: $ \frac{1}{8}x $

Substitute $ x = 88 $:

$$
\text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{11}
$$

The first plane takes **11 flights to France** in one day.
We are given the following information about how long each wolf howls:

- **Tobias** howls for **20 seconds** per howl.
- **Chikote** howls for **twice as long** as Tobias → so Chikote's howl is **2 × 20 = 40 seconds**.
- **Igneous** howls for **as long as the other two combined** → that means Igneous howls for **20 + 40 = 60 seconds**.

Now, we need to find the **combined length of time** of the three wolves' howls.

### Step-by-step:

- **Tobias**: 20 seconds  
- **Chikote**: 40 seconds  
- **Igneous**: 60 seconds  

**Total time** = 20 + 40 + 60 = **120 seconds**

Now convert seconds to **minutes**:

$$
120 \text{ seconds} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **2 minutes**.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

**Given:**

- Adam bought new trousers for **$30**.
- His **mother gave him $6** for this purpose.
- His **father gave him twice as much** as his mother.
- We are to find out how much **Adam had to contribute from his savings**.

---

**Step 1: Determine how much the father gave.**

The father gave **twice as much** as the mother, and the mother gave **$6**.

$$
\text{Father's contribution} = 2 \times 6 = 12
$$

---

**Step 2: Add the contributions from mother and father.**

$$
\text{Total from parents} = 6 + 12 = 18
$$

---

**Step 3: Subtract the total from parents from the total cost of the trousers.**

Adam needed **$30**, and he got **$18** from his parents.

$$
\text{Amount Adam contributed from savings} = 30 - 18 = 12
$$

---

**Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{12}
$$

So, **Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.**
We are given the following information:

- Four children: **Akbar**, **Alessandro**, **Helene**, and **Wilfred**.
- **Akbar is 3 years old**.
- **Alessandro is 4 years old**.
- **Total age of the group is 20**.
- **Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group**.

We are to find **Wilfred's age**.

---

### Step 1: Use the total age

Let’s denote the ages of the four children as:

- Akbar = 3
- Alessandro = 4
- Helene = H
- Wilfred = W

We are told that the **total age is 20**:

$$
3 + 4 + H + W = 20
$$

$$
7 + H + W = 20
$$

$$
H + W = 13 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the condition about Helene

We are told:

> **Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.**

First, compute the **average age** of the group:

$$
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
$$

So, **Helene is twice this average**:

$$
H = 2 \times 5 = 10
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for Wilfred's age

Now we know:

- H = 10
- From Equation 1: $ H + W = 13 $

$$
10 + W = 13
$$

$$
W = 3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{3}
$$

**Wilfred is 3 years old.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Total donations from others (neighbors and online fund)

- Walter collects **$500** from his neighbors.
- He also collects **$1,500** from an online fund.

So, total from **others** is:

$$
500 + 1500 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 2: Walter’s lawyer’s contribution

The problem says:

> "His lawyer offers to donate **three times as much as everyone else donates**."

So, the lawyer will donate:

$$
3 \times 2000 = 6000 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Friend’s donation

Then it says:

> "Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well."

This means the **friend** also donates **$200**. However, this doesn't affect the lawyer's contribution — the lawyer is still donating **three times as much as everyone else**, which includes the **neighbors, online fund, and the friend**.

So, the **total from everyone else** is now:

$$
2000 + 200 = 2200
$$

So the lawyer will donate:

$$
3 \times 2200 = 6600 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{6600}
$$

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute **$6,600**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of cookies**

- There are **100 guests** at the wedding.
- Each guest brings **15 cookies**.

So, total number of cookies:

$$
100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies per guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Cookies given to the church**

- The **bride gives half** of the cookies to the church.

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750 \text{ cookies}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Cookies per person in the church**

- Each person in the church gets **15 cookies**.

To find how many people got cookies, divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies per person:

$$
\frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies per person}} = 50 \text{ people}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{50}
$$

There were **50 people** in the church next door.
We are given:

- A family of **6 people**: **2 adults** and **4 kids**.
- Each **adult** gets a slice that is **twice as big** as each **kid**.
- We are to find: **What percentage of the watermelon does each adult get?**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let the size of one **kid’s slice** be $ x $.

Then, the size of one **adult’s slice** is $ 2x $.

---

### Step 2: Total number of slices

There are:

- 2 adults → 2 slices of size $ 2x $
- 4 kids → 4 slices of size $ x $

So total watermelon size =  
$$
2(2x) + 4(x) = 4x + 4x = 8x
$$

---

### Step 3: Size of one adult's slice as a fraction of the whole

Each adult gets a slice of size $ 2x $, and the total watermelon is $ 8x $.

So, the fraction of the watermelon that an adult gets is:
$$
\frac{2x}{8x} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

---

### Step 4: Convert to percentage

$$
\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 = 25\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.**
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records.

---

### **Given:**
- Total time available on Monday: **9 hours**
- Number of inpatients: **9**
- Time per inpatient (for rounds): **20 minutes**
- Number of appointments: **10**
- Time per appointment: **30 minutes**

---

### **Step 1: Convert all times to minutes for easier calculation.**

- 9 hours = **540 minutes**  
- 20 minutes per inpatient × 9 inpatients = **180 minutes**  
- 30 minutes per appointment × 10 appointments = **300 minutes**

---

### **Step 2: Add up the time spent on rounds and appointments.**

Total time used = 180 minutes (rounds) + 300 minutes (appointments) = **480 minutes**

---

### **Step 3: Subtract from total available time to find remaining time.**

Remaining time = 540 minutes (total) – 480 minutes (used) = **60 minutes**

---

### **Step 4: Convert remaining time back to hours.**

60 minutes = **1 hour**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.**
Let's break down the timeline of the cake-making process and work backward from the desired finish time to determine the **latest time Jordan can start** making the cake.

---

### **Given:**

- **Make batter:** 20 minutes  
- **Bake cake:** 30 minutes  
- **Cool cake:** 2 hours (120 minutes)  
- **Frost cake:** 10 minutes  
- **Desired finish time:** 5:00 PM

---

### **Step 1: Total time needed**

We need to add up all the steps:

- Make batter: 20 min  
- Bake: 30 min  
- Cool: 120 min  
- Frost: 10 min  

**Total time = 20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = 180 minutes = 3 hours**

So, the entire process takes **3 hours**.

---

### **Step 2: Work backward from 5:00 PM**

If the total time is 3 hours, then Jordan must start **3 hours before 5:00 PM**.

- 5:00 PM minus 3 hours = **2:00 PM**

---

### ✅ **Answer: Jordan can start making the cake as late as 2:00 PM** to be ready to serve it at 5:00 PM.
We are given:

- Lisa sold **3.5 boxes** of chocolate bars.
- Peter sold **4.5 boxes** of chocolate bars.
- Together, they sold **64 chocolate bars**.

We need to find how many **chocolate bars are in a box**.

---

### Step 1: Total number of boxes sold

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes, and Peter sold 4.5 boxes.

$$
\text{Total boxes} = 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \text{ boxes}
$$

---

### Step 2: Total chocolate bars = 64

So, the total number of chocolate bars is 64, and that came from **8 boxes**.

$$
\text{Number of chocolate bars per box} = \frac{64}{8} = 8
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{8}
$$

There are **8 chocolate bars in a box**.
Let's break down the problem step by step to calculate the **expected earnings** of the dance studio in a month.

---

### **Given:**

- **Cost to rent the studio per session:** $25  
- **Cost per student per session:** $1.50  
- **Number of students:** 10  
- **Studio is rented 3 days a week**  
- We need to find **monthly earnings**, so we'll assume **4 weeks per month** (standard assumption unless stated otherwise)

---

### **Step 1: Calculate daily cost**

Each session has:
- Rental cost: $25
- Cost per student: $1.50 × 10 = $15

So, total cost per session = $25 + $15 = **$40**

---

### **Step 2: Calculate weekly cost**

Studio is rented **3 days a week**, so:

Weekly cost = $40 × 3 = **$120**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate monthly cost**

Assuming 4 weeks in a month:

Monthly cost = $120 × 4 = **$480**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

The **expected earnings** of the dance studio in a month are **$480**.
We are given:

- Peter has **4 boxes**, each with the **same number of chocolate bars**.
- Martha has **7 boxes**, each with the **same number of chocolate bars**.
- Peter has a **total of 64** chocolate bars.
- Martha has a **total of 56** chocolate bars.

We are asked: **How many more chocolate bars does Peter have in each box than Martha?**

---

### Step 1: Find how many chocolate bars are in each box for Peter

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in total, and they are equally distributed among 4 boxes.

$$
\text{Chocolate bars per box (Peter)} = \frac{64}{4} = 16
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many chocolate bars are in each box for Martha

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in total, and they are equally distributed among 7 boxes.

$$
\text{Chocolate bars per box (Martha)} = \frac{56}{7} = 8
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the difference between the two

$$
\text{Difference} = 16 - 8 = 8
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total population of porcupines**
We are told:

- Total population = **50**

---

### **Step 2: Number of female porcupines**

The number of female porcupines is **3/5** of the total population:

$$
\text{Number of females} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
$$

So, there are **30 female porcupines**.

---

### **Step 3: Births per month**

Each female gives birth to **4 babies every month**.

So, the number of babies born each month is:

$$
\text{Babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total births in a year**

There are **12 months** in a year, so:

$$
\text{Total babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1,440
$$

---

### **Step 5: Total porcupines after one year**

We start with **50 porcupines**, and **1,440 new babies** are born in a year.

So, the total number of porcupines after a year is:

$$
\text{Total porcupines} = 50 + 1,440 = \boxed{1,490}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{1,490}
$$
Let's go step by step to find the total cost of filling the pool.

---

### **Step 1: Find the volume of the pool**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so the volume is:

$$
\text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Depth}
$$

Given:
- Length = 25 feet  
- Width = 14 feet  
- Depth = 4 feet  

$$
\text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Convert cubic feet to gallons**

We are told to **multiply the volume by 5.9** to get the number of gallons needed.

$$
\text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the cost**

The cost is **$0.10 per gallon**.

$$
\text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{826}
$$

It will cost **$826** to fill the pool.
Let's break this down step by step.

We are told:

1. There are **9 red sticks**.
2. There are **5 more blue sticks than red**.
3. The number of **yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks**.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of blue sticks

There are 9 red sticks, and there are 5 more blue sticks than red:

$$
\text{Blue sticks} = 9 + 5 = 14
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the number of yellow sticks

The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks:

$$
\text{Yellow sticks} = 14 - 3 = 11
$$

---

### Step 3: Add up all the sticks

Now we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks:

$$
\text{Total sticks} = \text{Red} + \text{Blue} + \text{Yellow} = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{34}
$$
We are given:

- **Matteo** traveled at **55 miles per hour** for **4 hours**.
- **Shandy** traveled at **45 miles per hour** for **10 hours**.

We need to find how many **miles farther** Shandy drove than Matteo.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the distance each person traveled.

**Distance = Speed × Time**

#### For Matteo:
$$
\text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 55 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 220 \, \text{miles}
$$

#### For Shandy:
$$
\text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} = 45 \, \text{mph} \times 10 \, \text{hours} = 450 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the difference in distance.

$$
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{Shandy}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{Matteo}} = 450 - 220 = 230 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.**
We are given the following information about Brook Hills High School:

- Total number of students: **3000**
- **Half** of these students are **over 16 years old**.
- **One-fourth** of the students over 16 are **male**.
- The **remaining half** of the students are **under 16 years old**.
- **One-half** of the students under 16 are **male**.

We are to find the **total number of female students** enrolled at the school.

---

### Step 1: Break down the student population

Total students = 3000

- **Over 16 years old**:  
  $ \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500 $ students

- **Under 16 years old**:  
  $ \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500 $ students

---

### Step 2: Find the number of male and female students in each group

#### Over 16 years old:
- Total: 1500
- One-fourth are male:  
  $ \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375 $ males  
  So, females = $ 1500 - 375 = 1125 $

#### Under 16 years old:
- Total: 1500
- One-half are male:  
  $ \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750 $ males  
  So, females = $ 1500 - 750 = 750 $

---

### Step 3: Add up all the female students

- Females over 16: 1125  
- Females under 16: 750  

Total female students =  
$ 1125 + 750 = \boxed{1875} $

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **1875 female students** are enrolled at Brook Hills High School.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Bethany's laps per hour
> **Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.**

So, **Bethany runs 10 laps per hour.**

---

### Step 2: Trey's laps per hour
> **Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.**

So, Trey runs:
$$
10 + 4 = 14 \text{ laps per hour}
$$

---

### Step 3: Shaelyn's laps per hour
> **Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.**

So, Shaelyn runs:
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \text{ laps per hour}
$$

---

### Step 4: Quinn's laps per hour
> **Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.**

So, Quinn runs:
$$
7 - 2 = 5 \text{ laps per hour}
$$

---

### Step 5: How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?

We are comparing **Bethany's laps** and **Quinn's laps** per hour.

- Bethany: 10 laps/hour  
- Quinn: 5 laps/hour  

Difference:
$$
10 - 5 = 5 \text{ laps}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Bethany can run 5 more laps per hour than Quinn.**
We are given:

- The **tank capacity** is **18,000 gallons**.
- On **Day 1**, Wanda filled **1/4 of the tank**, and Ms. B pumped **3/4 as much as Wanda**.
- On **Day 2**, Wanda pumped **2/3 of what she did on Day 1**, and Ms. B pumped **1/3 of what she did on Day 1**.

We need to find how many **gallons remain** for the tank to be full after both days.

---

### Step 1: Water pumped on Day 1

- Wanda filled **1/4 of the tank**:
  $$
  \text{Wanda's Day 1} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18,000 = 4,500 \text{ gallons}
  $$

- Ms. B pumped **3/4 as much as Wanda**:
  $$
  \text{Ms. B's Day 1} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4,500 = 3,375 \text{ gallons}
  $$

- Total water pumped on Day 1:
  $$
  4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 \text{ gallons}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Water pumped on Day 2

- Wanda pumped **2/3 of what she did on Day 1**:
  $$
  \text{Wanda's Day 2} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4,500 = 3,000 \text{ gallons}
  $$

- Ms. B pumped **1/3 of what she did on Day 1**:
  $$
  \text{Ms. B's Day 2} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3,375 = 1,125 \text{ gallons}
  $$

- Total water pumped on Day 2:
  $$
  3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 \text{ gallons}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Total water pumped over 2 days

$$
\text{Total} = 7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### Step 4: Remaining water to fill the tank

$$
\text{Remaining} = 18,000 - 12,000 = \boxed{6,000} \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{6,000} \text{ gallons remaining}
$$
We are given the following information about the power bank:

- Maria started charging her power bank **before** going to the park.
- She **disconnected it** and noticed it wasn't fully charged yet.
- While at the park, she **charged her friends' phones**, and during that time:
  - The power bank **lost 9% of its total capacity per hour** for the first **5 hours**.
  - Then, after 5 hours, it **lost 7% per hour** for the next **3 hours**.
  - At the end, the **remaining charge was 28%** of the original capacity.

We are to find:  
**What was the initial charge (in percentage) of the power bank when Maria went out to the park?**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let the **initial charge** (when she left home) be **x%**.

She **disconnected it** before going to the park, so the **charge when she left home is x%**.

Then, during the 5 hours at the park, the power bank **loses 9% per hour**, and then for the next 3 hours, it **loses 7% per hour**.

So we can model this as a series of percentage losses.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining charge after 5 hours

Each hour, it loses 9% of the **current** charge.

This is **exponential decay**, not linear.

So after 5 hours:

$$
\text{Remaining} = x \times (1 - 0.09)^5
$$

$$
= x \times (0.91)^5
$$

Calculate $ (0.91)^5 $:

$$
(0.91)^5 \approx 0.62403
$$

So after 5 hours:

$$
\text{Remaining} \approx 0.62403x
$$

---

### Step 3: Next 3 hours, losing 7% per hour

Now, for the next 3 hours, the battery loses **7% per hour**, again based on the **current** remaining charge.

So after 3 more hours:

$$
\text{Remaining} = 0.62403x \times (1 - 0.07)^3
$$

$$
= 0.62403x \times (0.93)^3
$$

Calculate $ (0.93)^3 $:

$$
(0.93)^3 \approx 0.804357
$$

So:

$$
\text{Remaining} \approx 0.62403x \times 0.804357 \approx 0.5025x
$$

---

### Step 4: Final remaining charge is 28%

We are told that after all this, the **remaining charge is 28%**.

So:

$$
0.5025x = 0.28
$$

Solve for x:

$$
x = \frac{0.28}{0.5025} \approx 0.5573
$$

So:

$$
x \approx 55.73\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**The initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately 55.73%.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the total amount Janet needs to save**

She wants to save **20% of the cost of a $10,000 car** for a down payment.

$$
\text{Down payment} = 20\% \times 10,000 = 0.20 \times 10,000 = \$2,000
$$

So, she needs to save **\$2,000**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Janet’s total earnings per hour**

- **Wages:** \$10/hour  
- **Tips:** \$15/hour  

$$
\text{Total earnings per hour} = 10 + 15 = \$25 \text{ per hour}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate her weekly earnings**

She works **40 hours per week**.

$$
\text{Weekly earnings} = 25 \times 40 = \$1,000 \text{ per week}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save \$2,000**

$$
\text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\$2,000}{\$1,000 \text{ per week}} = 2 \text{ weeks}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Janet will need to work **2 weeks** to save up the down payment.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many **plums** Jamaar can buy with his $10, after he has already bought some other fruits.

---

### **Step 1: List the prices of the fruits (including tax)**

- **Peaches**: $0.50 each  
- **Pears**: $0.50 each  
- **Apples**: $0.75 each  
- **Kiwis**: $1.00 each  
- **Plums**: $0.25 each  

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the fruits he **already** purchased**

He bought:

- 3 peaches:  
  $ 3 \times 0.50 = 1.50 $

- 4 pears:  
  $ 4 \times 0.50 = 2.00 $

- 2 kiwis:  
  $ 2 \times 1.00 = 2.00 $

- 5 apples:  
  $ 5 \times 0.75 = 3.75 $

Now add them all up:

$$
1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25
$$

So, he has already spent **$9.25**.

---

### **Step 3: Subtract from his total money**

He started with **$10**, so now he has:

$$
10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75
$$

He has **$0.75** left to spend on **plums**.

---

### **Step 4: How many plums can he buy?**

Each plum costs **$0.25**, so:

$$
\frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Jamaar can buy **3 plums** with the remaining money.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of sweets**

- The box contains **15 packs**.
- Each pack has **60 pieces**.

So, the total number of sweets is:

$$
15 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 900 \text{ pieces}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Sweets Anne kept**

Anne kept **2 packs**, so:

$$
2 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces per pack} = 120 \text{ pieces}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Sweets given to friends**

Total sweets given to friends = Total sweets – Sweets Anne kept

$$
900 - 120 = 780 \text{ pieces}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Divide sweets among 10 friends**

$$
\frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces per friend}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Each of Anne’s friends received **78 pieces** of sweets.
We are given:

- Initial price of carrots = $120  
- Annual increase = 5%  
- Time period = 3 years  

We need to calculate the price after **three years**, with a **5% annual increase**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the formula for compound growth

Since the price increases by **5% each year**, this is a **compound interest** problem, and the formula is:

$$
P = P_0 \times (1 + r)^t
$$

Where:
- $ P $ = final price  
- $ P_0 $ = initial price = $120  
- $ r $ = annual growth rate = 5% = 0.05  
- $ t $ = time in years = 3

---

### Step 2: Plug in the values

$$
P = 120 \times (1 + 0.05)^3
$$

$$
P = 120 \times (1.05)^3
$$

Now compute $ (1.05)^3 $:

$$
(1.05)^3 = 1.157625
$$

So:

$$
P = 120 \times 1.157625 = 138.915
$$

---

### Step 3: Round to the nearest integer

$$
\text{Rounded price} = \boxed{139}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$139**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of pictures
Olivia uploaded **72 pictures** to Facebook.

### Step 2: Number of albums
She put the **same number of pictures into 8 albums**.

So, each album has:
$$
\frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ pictures per album}
$$

### Step 3: Types of albums
- **3 albums** are **selfies only**
- **2 albums** are **portraits**

That’s a total of:
$$
3 + 2 = 5 \text{ albums}
$$

But wait — she made **8 albums total**, so the other **3 albums** must be something else. But the question is only asking about **portraits and selfies**, which are **3 + 2 = 5 albums**.

So we can assume the remaining **3 albums** are not portraits or selfies (maybe family photos, etc.), but since the question is only about **portraits and selfies**, we’ll focus on those.

### Step 4: Pictures in portraits and selfies
Each of the **5 albums** (3 selfies + 2 portraits) has **9 pictures**.

So total number of portraits and selfies is:
$$
5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ pictures}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Olivia has **45 portraits and selfies** in total.
We are given:

- James reads **3 pages** in **10 minutes**.
- He reads **18 pages** in total before going to bed.

### Step 1: Find how long it takes to read 1 page
If 3 pages take 10 minutes, then:

$$
\text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page}
$$

### Step 2: Find the time for 18 pages
$$
\text{Total time} = 18 \text{ pages} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page}
$$

$$
= \frac{18 \times 10}{3} = \frac{180}{3} = 60 \text{ minutes}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
James spends **60 minutes** reading.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out **how many guests the hotel now has**.

---

### **Initial Information:**

- The hotel was **completely booked with 100 guests** at the beginning of the day.
- **24 guests elected an early checkout.**
- **15 guests elected a late checkout.**
- In the afternoon, **twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout.**
- **7 more people checked in after dinner was served.**

We are asked: **How many guests does the hotel now have?**

---

### **Step 1: Initial number of guests**

At the start of the day:

> **100 guests** were in the hotel.

---

### **Step 2: Guests who left (checked out)**

- 24 guests **elected an early checkout**
- 15 guests **elected a late checkout**

So, total guests who **checked out** =  
$$
24 + 15 = 39 \text{ guests}
$$

So, the number of guests **remaining** in the hotel before any new check-ins is:  
$$
100 - 39 = 61 \text{ guests}
$$

---

### **Step 3: New check-ins in the afternoon**

It says:

> "In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout."

We already know that **15 guests opted for a late checkout**, so:

$$
\text{New check-ins} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ guests}
$$

Add these to the remaining guests:

$$
61 + 30 = 91 \text{ guests}
$$

---

### **Step 4: More check-ins after dinner**

Then:

> "7 more people checked in after dinner was served."

Add these to the current total:

$$
91 + 7 = 98 \text{ guests}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{98}
$$

So, the hotel now has **98 guests**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Wednesday**: John picks **4 bananas**.
2. **Thursday**: John picks **6 bananas**.
3. **Friday**: John picks **triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday**.

So, on **Friday**, he picks:  
$$
3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ bananas}
$$

Now, let's add them all up:

- Wednesday: 4 bananas  
- Thursday: 6 bananas  
- Friday: 12 bananas  

Total bananas:
$$
4 + 6 + 12 = 22
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **22 bananas**.

  0.4 \times 60 = 24 \text{ easy questions}
  $$

- The remaining **60%** are **average and difficult**, which are **equally divided**.

  So:
  $$
  \frac{60 - 24}{2} = \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ average questions}
  $$
  $$
  18 \text{ difficult questions}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: How many questions Aries is sure to get right**

- **Easy questions**: She gets **75%** of them correct  
  $$
  0.75 \times 24 = 18 \text{ easy questions correct}
  $$

- **Average and difficult questions**: She gets **half** of them correct  
  $$
  \frac{1}{2} \times (18 + 18) = \frac{1}{2} \times 36 = 18 \text{ average/difficult questions correct}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Total number of questions she is sure to get right**

$$
18 \text{ (easy)} + 18 \text{ (average/difficult)} = 36
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{36}
$$

Aries is sure to get **36 points**.
We are given the following information:

- Teresa sells **large stuffed animals** for **three times the price of small ones**.
- She sold **twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones**.
- She earned a total of **$120** from sales.
- Each **small stuffed animal costs $4**.

We need to find how many **small stuffed animals** she sold.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ x $ = number of **large stuffed animals** sold
- Then, number of **small stuffed animals** sold = $ 2x $ (since she sold twice as many small ones)

---

### Step 2: Price of each item

- Price of a **small** stuffed animal = $4
- Price of a **large** stuffed animal = 3 × price of small = $ 3 × 4 = $12

---

### Step 3: Total revenue equation

Total revenue = (Revenue from small animals) + (Revenue from large animals)

$$
\text{Revenue} = (\text{Number of small} \times \text{Price of small}) + (\text{Number of large} \times \text{Price of large})
$$

$$
120 = (2x \times 4) + (x \times 12)
$$

$$
120 = 8x + 12x
$$

$$
120 = 20x
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = \frac{120}{20} = 6
$$

So, number of **large** stuffed animals sold = 6  
Number of **small** stuffed animals sold = $ 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12 $

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{12}
$$

Teresa sold **12 small stuffed animals**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Find the total number of sandwiches eaten per day by the family.

- **Man:** 5 sandwiches/day  
- **Wife:** 4 sandwiches/day  
- **Son:** 2 sandwiches/day  

Add them up:

$$
5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day}
$$

### Step 2: Find the total number of sandwiches eaten in one week.

There are 7 days in a week, so:

$$
11 \text{ sandwiches/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 77 \text{ sandwiches}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**77 sandwiches** are eaten by the family in one week.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much money Suzanne has left from her earnings.

---

### Step 1: Calculate earnings from cookies
Suzanne sold **80 cookies** at **$1 each**:

$$
80 \times 1 = 80 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate earnings from cupcakes
She sold **60 cupcakes** at **$4 each**:

$$
60 \times 4 = 240 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total earnings
Add the earnings from cookies and cupcakes:

$$
80 + 240 = 320 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Subtract the amount given to her sisters
She gave **$10 to each of her two sisters**, so:

$$
10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 5: Calculate remaining money
Subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings:

$$
320 - 20 = 300 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Suzanne has $300 left from her earnings.**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of eggs
The team hid **100 eggs**.

### Step 2: Eggs found by the Smith twins
Each of the Smith twins found **30 eggs**, so together they found:

$$
30 + 30 = 60 \text{ eggs}
$$

### Step 3: Remaining eggs
Total eggs = 100  
Eggs found by twins = 60  
So, the remaining eggs are:

$$
100 - 60 = 40 \text{ eggs}
$$

### Step 4: Eggs not found by friends
It says "All the other eggs **except 10** were found by their friends."

This means that **10 eggs were not found by friends**, so the rest (40 - 10 = 30) were found by friends.

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{30} \text{ eggs}
$$

So, the friends found **30 eggs**.
We are given the following information:

- **One dwarf** can mine **12 pounds of ore per day** with his **bare hands**.
- With an **iron pickaxe**, he can mine **twice as much** as with bare hands.
- With a **steel pickaxe**, he can mine **50% more** than with an iron pickaxe.

We are to find how many pounds of ore **40 dwarves** with **steel pickaxes** can mine in **one month (30 days)**.

---

### Step 1: Determine the ore mining rate with a steel pickaxe

- Bare hands: 12 pounds/day
- Iron pickaxe: 2 × 12 = **24 pounds/day**
- Steel pickaxe: 50% more than iron = 24 + (0.5 × 24) = **36 pounds/day**

So, **one dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds/day**.

---

### Step 2: Find total ore mined by 40 dwarves in one day

- 40 dwarves × 36 pounds/day = **1,440 pounds/day**

---

### Step 3: Find total ore mined in 30 days

- 1,440 pounds/day × 30 days = **43,200 pounds**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**43,200 pounds of ore** can be mined by 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes in a month (30 days).
We are told that the prices of the sandwich packages are **proportional**, meaning that the cost per sandwich is the same for all package sizes.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information

- **Package 1**: 2 sandwiches for $3  
- **Package 2**: 4 sandwiches for $6  
- **Package 3**: 8 sandwiches (price unknown)

We are to find the price of the third package, knowing that the prices are proportional.

---

### Step 2: Find the cost per sandwich

Let’s calculate the **cost per sandwich** for each package:

- **Package 1**:  
  $$
  \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  $$

- **Package 2**:  
  $$
  \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
  $$

So the cost per sandwich is consistent at **$1.50**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of 8 sandwiches

If each sandwich costs $1.50, then 8 sandwiches will cost:

$$
8 \times 1.5 = 12
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{12}
$$

The package with 8 sandwiches will cost **$12**.
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### 1. **Cost of the new bedroom set:**
- **$3000**

---

### 2. **He sells his old bedroom for $1000 and uses that to pay part of the cost.**

So, he uses **$1000** of the **$3000** to pay for the new bedroom set.

That means he still owes:

$$
3000 - 1000 = 2000
$$

---

### 3. **He has to pay 10% a month on the bedroom set.**

This means he pays **10% of the total cost of the bedroom set per month**, not just the remaining amount after using the $1000.

So, the **monthly payment is**:

$$
10\% \text{ of } 3000 = 0.10 \times 3000 = 300
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**He has to pay $300 per month.**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Balloons Sally Was Holding**

Sally starts with:

- **25 red balloons**
- **7 green balloons**
- **12 yellow balloons**

**Total initial balloons = 25 + 7 + 12 = 44 balloons**

---

### **Step 2: Red Balloons Burst (40%)**

40% of the red balloons burst.

- 40% of 25 = 0.4 × 25 = **10 red balloons burst**
- Remaining red balloons = 25 - 10 = **15 red balloons**

So now, she has **15 red balloons** left.

---

### **Step 3: Yellow Balloons Released (Half of them)**

She accidentally releases half of the yellow balloons.

- 12 yellow balloons → half is 6
- So, **6 yellow balloons are released**
- Remaining yellow balloons = 12 - 6 = **6 yellow balloons**

---

### **Step 4: Total Balloons After Bursting and Releasing**

Now we sum up what’s left:

- **15 red**
- **7 green**
- **6 yellow**

**Total = 15 + 7 + 6 = 28 balloons**

---

### **Step 5: Finding 8 Blue Balloons in a Tree**

She finds **8 blue balloons** caught in a tree.

She adds **75% of them** to her remaining balloons.

- 75% of 8 = 0.75 × 8 = **6 blue balloons**

So, she adds **6 blue balloons** to her current total.

---

### **Step 6: Final Total Balloons Carried Into School**

She had **28 balloons**, then added **6 blue balloons**.

**Final total = 28 + 6 = 34 balloons**

---

### ✅ **Answer: 34 balloons**
We are given the probabilities of Marcus **not** having to turn in his homework, and we need to find the **percentage chance that he *will* have to turn it in**.

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the scenarios

There are **three possible ways** Marcus can **avoid** turning in his homework:

1. **Substitute teacher doesn’t collect homework** (50% chance)
2. **Normal teacher gives an extension** (40% chance, even if substitute is not there)
3. **Marcus convinces the teacher his dog ate it** (20% chance, even if no extension)

These are **mutually exclusive** events — only one of them can happen at a time. So we can **add up the probabilities** of these three events to get the total probability that **Marcus doesn’t** have to turn in his homework.

---

### Step 2: Add up the probabilities of avoiding homework

- Substitute teacher doesn’t collect homework: **50%**
- Normal teacher gives extension: **40%**
- Marcus gets personal extension: **20%**

So, total chance **not** to turn in homework =  
$$
50\% + 40\% + 20\% = 110\%
$$

Wait! That's **more than 100%**, which is impossible. This suggests that some of these events might **overlap**, or that they’re **not mutually exclusive**.

But the problem says:

> "Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension."

This implies that the **extension is given to everyone**, so **if the normal teacher comes in, everyone gets an extension**, including Marcus.

Similarly, the last event — **convincing the teacher** — is **independent** of the other two, but **only applies if the teacher is present**.

So, let's re-analyze carefully.

---

### Step 3: Clarify the conditions

We must assume that the **substitute teacher** is **only** present **if** the normal teacher is **not** present.

So the possible cases are:

#### Case 1: Substitute teacher is present (50% chance)
- Then **no homework is collected** → Marcus **doesn’t** have to turn it in.

#### Case 2: Substitute teacher is **not** present (50% chance)
- Then the **normal teacher is present**.
  - With **40% chance**, she gives **everyone** an extension → Marcus **doesn’t** have to turn in homework.
  - With **60% chance**, no extension is given.
    - Then, with **20% chance**, Marcus **convinces the teacher** → gets an extension.
    - With **80% chance**, he **doesn’t** convince the teacher → has to turn in homework.

So now we can compute the **total probability that Marcus has to turn in homework**.

---

### Step 4: Compute the probability that Marcus **has to turn in** homework

We’ll use the law of total probability.

#### Case 1: Substitute teacher is present (50%)
- Marcus **does not** have to turn in homework.

#### Case 2: Substitute teacher is **not** present (50%)
- Now, normal teacher is present.
  - 40% chance → everyone gets extension → Marcus doesn’t have to turn in homework.
  - 60% chance → no extension.
    - 20% chance → Marcus gets personal extension → doesn’t have to turn in homework.
    - 80% chance → Marcus **does** have to turn in homework.

So, within this case:
- Probability Marcus **has to turn in homework** = 60% × 80% = **48%**

Now, since this case happens **50% of the time**, the overall probability is:
$$
0.5 \times 0.48 = 0.24
$$

---

### Final Answer:

The **percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow** is:

$$
\boxed{24\%}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total capacity of the Fine Arts Center**
The Fine Arts Center has space for **6000 people**.

---

### **Step 2: Subtract seats reserved for graduates and faculty**

- **Graduates:** 950 seats  
- **Faculty:** 300 seats  

So, the total number of seats already reserved is:

$$
950 + 300 = 1250 \text{ seats}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate remaining seats available for others**

$$
6000 - 1250 = 4750 \text{ seats}
$$

These 4750 seats are available for **friends and family of graduates**.

---

### **Step 4: Determine how many tickets each graduate would receive**

Assuming that each graduate gives out **one ticket** to a friend or family member, and all these 4750 seats are distributed **equally** among the graduates, we need to find how many tickets each graduate would get.

But wait — we don't know how many **graduates** there are. However, we **do** know that **950 seats are reserved for graduates**, so we can assume that there are **950 graduates** (assuming one graduate per seat).

So, if there are **950 graduates**, and **4750 tickets** are to be given out equally, then each graduate would get:

$$
\frac{4750}{950} = 5 \text{ tickets}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Each graduate would receive 5 tickets.**
We are given the following information:

- **Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans to feel full.**
- He can eat **twice as many medium-sized beans** as large ones.
- Eating **3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean**.

We need to find out **how many small jelly beans Grandpa can eat** before he feels full.

---

### Step 1: Find how many medium jelly beans he can eat

He can eat **twice as many medium beans as large**:

$$
\text{Medium beans} = 2 \times \text{Large beans} = 2 \times 75 = 150
$$

So, he can eat **150 medium jelly beans**.

---

### Step 2: Convert medium beans to small beans

We're told that **3 small beans = 1 medium bean**.

So, to find how many small beans equal 150 medium beans:

$$
\text{Small beans} = 150 \times 3 = 450
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{450}
$$

Grandpa can eat **450 small jelly beans** before he feels full.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much **jury pay Melissa makes per hour after expenses**.

---

### **Step 1: Total days on jury duty**
Melissa is on jury duty for **3 days**.

---

### **Step 2: Daily payment**
She is paid **$15 per day**.

So, total payment for 3 days is:

$$
3 \text{ days} \times \$15/\text{day} = \$45
$$

---

### **Step 3: Parking costs**
She has to pay **$3 per day** for parking.

So, total parking cost for 3 days is:

$$
3 \text{ days} \times \$3/\text{day} = \$9
$$

---

### **Step 4: Net earnings**
Now subtract the parking costs from the total payment:

$$
\$45 - \$9 = \$36
$$

So, Melissa’s **net earnings** over 3 days are **\$36**.

---

### **Step 5: Total hours spent**
She spends **6 hours a day** for **3 days**:

$$
6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 6: Pay per hour after expenses**
Now divide her net earnings by the total number of hours:

$$
\frac{\$36}{18 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Melissa makes \$2 per hour after expenses.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

3 \times 16 = 48
$$

So, he spends **$48** on books.

---

### Step 3: Cost of pencils
He buys **3 pencils** at **$6 each**.

$$
3 \times 6 = 18
$$

So, he spends **$18** on pencils.

---

### Step 4: Total amount spent
Add the cost of books and pencils:

$$
48 + 18 = 66
$$

---

### Final Answer:
Ted spent a total of **$66**.
We are given the following information:

- **Driveway width**: 24 feet  
- **Bottle placement**: Every 3 feet  
- **Time between bottles**: 5 seconds  
- **Starts at the first bottle**  

---

### Step 1: Determine how many soda bottles are needed

We need to place a bottle every 3 feet along a 24-foot driveway.

$$
\text{Number of bottles} = \frac{24}{3} = 8
$$

So, Richard will place **8 bottles**.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many intervals between bottles there are

If there are 8 bottles, there are **7 intervals** between them (since the number of intervals is always one less than the number of items).

$$
\text{Intervals} = 8 - 1 = 7
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total time

Each interval takes 5 seconds.

$$
\text{Total time} = 7 \times 5 = 35 \text{ seconds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**35 seconds** total.
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Find the total number of apples:**

   - So, total apples = $ 40 \times 2 = 80 $ apples.

2. **Determine how many packs can be made:**
   - Each pack contains **8 apples**.
   - To find the number of packs, divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per pack:
     $$
     \frac{80}{8} = 10
     $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **10 packs**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find the cost of Parmesan cheese
- **Price per pound**: $11
- **Pounds bought**: 2
- **Total cost for Parmesan** = $ 11 \times 2 = 22 $ dollars

---

### Step 2: Find the cost of Mozzarella cheese
- **Price per pound**: $6
- **Pounds bought**: 3
- **Total cost for Mozzarella** = $ 6 \times 3 = 18 $ dollars

---

### Step 3: Total cost of both cheeses
- **Total cost** = Cost of Parmesan + Cost of Mozzarella  
  = $ 22 + 18 = 40 $ dollars

---

### Step 4: Calculate how much money is left
- **Initial amount**: $50
- **Money spent on cheese**: $40
- **Money left** = $ 50 - 40 = 10 $ dollars

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.**
Let's break this down step by step to figure out **how long it would take Jim to earn back the money equivalent to his college loans and the money he lost from not working while in school**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**

- **Time in college**: 4 years  
- **Loans per year**: $50,000  
- **Annual salary before college**: $25,000  
- **College degree triples his income** (after college)  
- **Goal**: How long will it take for Jim to **earn back** the total amount of:
  - The **total loan amount**
  - The **money he lost by not working during college**

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total loans**

Jim takes out $50,000 per year for 4 years:

$$
\text{Total loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate money lost from not working**

During the 4 years in college, Jim is not working. So he loses:

$$
\text{Money lost} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total amount to be earned back**

$$
\text{Total to earn back} = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000
$$

---

### **Step 5: What is Jim’s income after college?**

His income triples after getting a degree:

$$
\text{Post-college salary} = 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000 \text{ per year}
$$

---

### **Step 6: How long will it take to earn back $300,000 at $75,000/year?**

$$
\text{Time to earn back} = \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4 \text{ years}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

It would take **4 years** for Jim to earn back the money equivalent to the loans and the money he lost from not working while in school.
We are given that Jim is making a **comforter** for his **king-sized bed**, which measures **6 feet long by 8 feet wide**.

He needs **two pieces of fabric** that are **2 feet longer and 2 feet wider** than the bed.

---

### Step 1: Determine the dimensions of each fabric piece

The bed is **6 ft by 8 ft**.

Each fabric piece must be **2 feet longer and 2 feet wider** than the bed. So:

- Length of each fabric piece = 6 + 2 = **8 feet**
- Width of each fabric piece = 8 + 2 = **10 feet**

So, each fabric piece is **8 feet by 10 feet**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the area of one fabric piece

$$
\text{Area of one fabric} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 8 \times 10 = 80 \text{ square feet}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total area for two fabric pieces

$$
\text{Total fabric needed} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ square feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.**
We are given the number of letters delivered on **Monday**, and then asked to find the total number of letters delivered from **Monday to Wednesday**.

---

### Step 1: Letters delivered on **Monday**
> On Monday, the post office delivered **425 letters**.

So:
$$
\text{Monday} = 425
$$

---

### Step 2: Letters delivered on **Tuesday**
> On Tuesday, they delivered **17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday**.

First, find one-fifth of Monday’s letters:
$$
\frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85
$$

Then add 17:
$$
85 + 17 = 102
$$

So:
$$
\text{Tuesday} = 102
$$

---

### Step 3: Letters delivered on **Wednesday**
> On Wednesday, they delivered **5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday**.

First, double Tuesday’s letters:
$$
2 \times 102 = 204
$$

Then add 5:
$$
204 + 5 = 209
$$

So:
$$
\text{Wednesday} = 209
$$

---

### Step 4: Total letters delivered (Monday to Wednesday)
Add up the letters from all three days:

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday}
$$
$$
\text{Total} = 425 + 102 + 209 = 736
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{736}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find the total amount Molly will pay for catering.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the chicken salad

- **Number of people who want chicken salad:** 10  
- **Cost per person for chicken salad:** $6.50  

$$
\text{Total cost for chicken salad} = 10 \times 6.50 = 65.00
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the pasta salad

- **Number of people who want pasta salad:** 6  
- **Cost per person for pasta salad:** $6.00  

$$
\text{Total cost for pasta salad} = 6 \times 6.00 = 36.00
$$

---

### Step 3: Add both amounts to get the total cost

$$
\text{Total cost} = 65.00 + 36.00 = 101.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Molly will pay a total of $101.00 for the catering.**
Let's break down the problem step by step and calculate how much Johnny's dad lost on average that day.

---

### Step 1: First Race
- He **lost** $5.

So, **loss = $5**

---

### Step 2: Second Race
- He **won** $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.

He lost $5 in the first race, so:

- Twice the loss = 2 × $5 = $10  
- Add $1 → $10 + $1 = **$11 won**

So, **gain = $11**

---

### Step 3: Third Race
- He **lost** 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.

He won $11 in the second race, so:

- 1.5 × $11 = **$16.50 lost**

So, **loss = $16.50**

---

### Step 4: Total Loss

Now we need to find the **total loss** for the day.

- First race: **$5 loss**
- Second race: **$11 gain** (not a loss)
- Third race: **$16.50 loss**

Total **loss** = $5 + $16.50 = **$21.50**

---

### Step 5: Average Loss per Race

There are **3 races**, so:

$$
\text{Average loss} = \frac{\text{Total loss}}{\text{Number of races}} = \frac{21.50}{3} = \boxed{7.17}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**He lost an average of $7.17 per race that day.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of countries in South America**: 26  
2. **Number of cities per country**: 5  
3. **Population per city**: 1000 people  

---

### Step 1: Find the total number of cities in South America  
$$
26 \text{ countries} \times 5 \text{ cities per country} = 130 \text{ cities}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the total population  
Each city has 1000 people, so:
$$
130 \text{ cities} \times 1000 \text{ people per city} = 130{,}000 \text{ people}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
$$
\boxed{130{,}000}
$$

There are **130,000 people** in South America based on the given information.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Convert Xavier's original height to inches

Xavier was **4 feet tall**.  
Since **1 foot = 12 inches**, we convert:

$$
4 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches}
$$

Xavier grew **3 inches**, so his new height is:

$$
48 + 3 = 51 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 2: Cole's height

Cole was already **50 inches tall** and grew **2 inches**, so his new height is:

$$
50 + 2 = 52 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the difference in their heights

Now, subtract Xavier's height from Cole's height:

$$
52 - 51 = 1 \text{ inch}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch.**
We are told that **three people divided $1920**, and the shares are related as follows:

- The **second person** took **$80 more** than the **first**.
- The **third person** took **twice** what the **second** took.

Let’s define the share of the **first person** as **x** (in dollars).

---

### Step 1: Express the shares in terms of x

- First person: **x**
- Second person: **x + 80**
- Third person: **2 × (x + 80) = 2x + 160**

---

### Step 2: Write the total amount equation

The total amount is $1920, so:

$$
x + (x + 80) + (2x + 160) = 1920
$$

Simplify the left side:

$$
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
$$
$$
4x + 240 = 1920
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for x

Subtract 240 from both sides:

$$
4x = 1920 - 240 = 1680
$$

Divide by 4:

$$
x = \frac{1680}{4} = 420
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

The **share of the first person** is **$420**.
Let's break this down step by step to find out **how many hours of work each painter put in**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the total time worked

The team of 4 painters worked **3/8ths of a day every day for 3 weeks**.

First, convert **3 weeks into days**:

$$
3 \text{ weeks} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
$$

Now, calculate how many days they worked:

$$
\frac{3}{8} \text{ day/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ days}
$$

---

### Step 2: Convert days to hours

There are **24 hours in a day**, so:

$$
\frac{63}{8} \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = \frac{63 \times 24}{8} = \frac{1512}{8} = 189 \text{ hours}
$$

So, the **total number of hours worked by the team** is **189 hours**.

---

### Step 3: Find how many hours each painter worked

There are **4 painters**, so divide the total hours by 4:

$$
\frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours per painter}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Each painter worked 47.25 hours.**
We are given the following information:

- Let the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the **second set** be $ x $.
- In the **first set**, he retrieved **4 more** than in the second set: so that's $ x + 4 $.
- In the **third set**, he retrieved **half as many** as in the second set: so that's $ \frac{x}{2} $.
- The **total** number of balls retrieved is **19**.

---

### Step 1: Write the equation

$$
\text{Total balls} = \text{First set} + \text{Second set} + \text{Third set}
$$

$$
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
$$

---

### Step 2: Combine like terms

Combine all the $ x $ terms:

$$
x + x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
$$

$$
2x + \frac{x}{2} + 4 = 19
$$

To combine the $ x $ terms, convert to a common denominator:

$$
\frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{5x}{2}
$$

So now the equation becomes:

$$
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

Subtract 4 from both sides:

$$
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
5x = 30
$$

Divide both sides by 5:

$$
x = 6
$$

---

### Step 4: Find the number of balls in the first set

$$
\text{First set} = x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.**
We are given:

- Initial price of the car in 2007: **$20,000**
- Annual depreciation rate: **21%**
- We need to find the price in **2010**

---

### Step 1: Determine the number of years
From 2007 to 2010 is **3 years**.

---

### Step 2: Use the formula for exponential decay (depreciation)

The formula for depreciation is:

$$
V = P \times (1 - r)^t
$$

Where:
- $ V $ = final value
- $ P $ = initial value = $20,000
- $ r $ = annual depreciation rate = 21% = 0.21
- $ t $ = time in years = 3

---

### Step 3: Plug in the values

$$
V = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3
$$
$$
V = 20000 \times (0.79)^3
$$

Now calculate $ 0.79^3 $:

$$
0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039
$$

So:

$$
V = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

The price of the car in 2010 is approximately **\$9,860.78**.
We are told there are **50 books** in total.

### Step 1: Find the number of English books  
Half of the books are written in **English**:  
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \text{ English books}
$$

### Step 2: Find the number of German books  
10% of the books are written in **German**:  
$$
10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 \text{ German books}
$$

### Step 3: Find the number of Spanish books  
The rest of the books are in **Spanish**. So we subtract the English and German books from the total:  
$$
50 - 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ Spanish books}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
$$
\boxed{20}
$$
We are given:

- Total distance from San Diego to New York City: **1955 kilometers**
- Bernice drove **325 kilometers for 4 days**

We need to find how many kilometers she still needs to drive.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance driven

She drove **325 km per day** for **4 days**:

$$
325 \, \text{km/day} \times 4 \, \text{days} = 1300 \, \text{km}
$$

---

### Step 2: Subtract the distance driven from the total distance

$$
1955 \, \text{km} - 1300 \, \text{km} = 655 \, \text{km}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Bernice will still need to drive **655 kilometers**.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Find out how many cups of water Ingrid drinks in one day.
Ingrid drinks **8 cups** of water every day.

---

### Step 2: Find out how many cups she drinks in 30 days.
$$
8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### Step 3: Convert cups to gallons.
We are told that **1 gallon = 16 cups**.

So, to find how many gallons 240 cups is:
$$
\frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**15 gallons** of water.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Initial Setup:**

- **Romeo boards a train with 120 people.**
  - So, **initial number of people on the train = 120**

---

### **First Stop:**

- **20 more people board the train.**
  - New total = 120 + 20 = **140 people**

---

### **Second Stop:**

- **50 people descend from the train.**
- **Twice that number (2 × 50 = 100) people board the train.**

So:
- After 50 people leave: 140 - 50 = **90 people**
- Then 100 people board: 90 + 100 = **190 people**

---

### **Third Stop:**

- **80 more people descend from the train.**

So:
- 190 - 80 = **110 people**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

**The total number of people on the train at the final stop is: 110**.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Alison spent on athletic gear.

---

### 1. **Tank Top**
- Cost: **$10**

---

### 2. **Running Shorts**
- They cost **$5 more than the tank top**.
- Tank top = $10 → Running shorts = $10 + $5 = **$15**

---

### 3. **Tennis Shoes**
- Original price: **$48**
- On **half price sale**, so:
  - Sale price = $48 ÷ 2 = **$24**

---

### 4. **Athletic Socks**
- Original price of the package: **$8**
- She had a **$2 off coupon**, so:
  - Final price = $8 − $2 = **$6**

---

### Now, add up all the costs:

- Tank top: $10  
- Running shorts: $15  
- Tennis shoes: $24  
- Athletic socks: $6  

**Total = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$55**
Sure! Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the problem
- **Total area of the kitchen floor**: 200 square feet (SqFt)
- **Tile size**: Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot → so each tile covers **1 sq ft**
- **Cost per tile**: $12

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of tiles needed
Since each tile is 1 sq ft, and the total area is 200 sq ft, you need:

$$
\text{Number of tiles} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Area per tile}} = \frac{200}{1} = 200 \text{ tiles}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost
$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of tiles} \times \text{Cost per tile} = 200 \times 12 = \$2400
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**It will cost you $2400 to renovate your kitchen floor.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Normal monthly cost**: $120  
2. **Insurance cost increased by 60%** due to the accident.  
   - To find 60% of $120:  
     $$
     0.60 \times 120 = 72
     $$
   - So, the new monthly cost is:  
     $$
     120 + 72 = 192
     $$

3. **Now calculate the annual cost**:  
   - There are 12 months in a year, so:  
     $$
     192 \times 12 = 2304
     $$

### ✅ Final Answer: James pays **$2,304** a year.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many sets of sheets Greg uses per week**

- **Twin beds:** 4 beds × 1 set of sheets = **4 twin sets**
- **King size bed:** 1 bed × 1 set of sheets = **1 king set**

So, **per week**, Greg uses:

- **4 twin sets**
- **1 king set**

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many loads the laundry machine can handle per week**

- The machine can wash **2 twin sets at a time**
- It can wash **1 king set at a time**

So, in one load:

- 2 twin sets + 1 king set = **3 sets total**

But we need to calculate how many **loads** are needed for **4 twin sets** and **1 king set**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how many loads are needed per week**

- For **twin sets**:  
  4 twin sets ÷ 2 twin sets per load = **2 loads**

- For **king set**:  
  1 king set ÷ 1 king set per load = **1 load**

So, total loads per week = **2 + 1 = 3 loads**

---

### **Step 4: Calculate how many loads per year**

There are **52 weeks** in a year.

So, total loads per year = 3 loads/week × 52 weeks = **156 loads**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**156 loads of laundry per year.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the movie-watching pattern**

- **Saturday:** They watch **4 movies**.
- **Sunday:** They watch **half** the number of movies as on Saturday.  
  So, on Sunday:  
  $$
  \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ movies}
  $$

So, **each weekend (Saturday + Sunday)**, they watch:
$$
4 + 2 = 6 \text{ movies}
$$

---

### **Step 2: How many weekends are in 4 weeks?**

- A **weekend** is one Saturday and one Sunday.
- In **4 weeks**, there are **4 weekends**.

---

### **Step 3: Total number of movies in 4 weeks**

$$
\text{Movies per weekend} = 6 \\
\text{Number of weekends} = 4 \\
\text{Total movies} = 6 \times 4 = 24
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$

### **Step 1: Two years ago**
Leo had **100 stickers** in his collection.

---

### **Step 2: Last year**
Leo collected **50 stickers**.  
So, the total number of stickers he had **at the end of last year** is:

$$
100 + 50 = 150 \text{ stickers}
$$

---

### **Step 3: This year**
Leo collected **twice the number of stickers as the previous year**.  
The "previous year" here refers to **last year**, when he collected **50 stickers**.

So, this year he collected:

$$
2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ stickers}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total stickers now**
Add the 100 stickers he collected this year to the 150 stickers he had at the end of last year:

$$
150 + 100 = 250 \text{ stickers}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Leo has 250 stickers in his collection.**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Find out how much cat food is used per day

Imma feeds her **3 cats twice a day**, and each feeding uses **60 grams of cat food**.

So, the total amount of food used per day is:

$$
3 \text{ cats} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} \times 60 \text{ grams/feeding} = 360 \text{ grams/day}
$$

### Step 2: Determine how long 720 grams will last

Now we know that Imma uses **360 grams of cat food per day**.

We want to find out how many days 720 grams will last:

$$
\frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**720 grams of cat food will last 2 days.**
We are told:

- There are **4 pizzas**, each with **8 slices**, so total number of slices is:
  $$
  4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ slices}
  $$

- **Becky ate 10 slices.**
- **Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake.**
- **Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake.**

Let’s define variables:

- Let $ J $ = number of slices Jake ate.
- Then Becky = $ J + 3 $
- Silvia = $ 2J $

We’re told that **Becky ate 10 slices**, so:

$$
J + 3 = 10 \Rightarrow J = 7
$$

Now we can find the number of slices each person ate:

- **Jake** = 7 slices  
- **Becky** = 10 slices  
- **Silvia** = $ 2 \times 7 = 14 $ slices  

Now, let's add them up to find the **total slices eaten**:

$$
7 + 10 + 14 = 31
$$

So, they ate a total of **31 slices**.

But wait — there were **32 slices** in total. That means **1 slice was left uneaten**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**They ate a total of 31 slices.**
We are given:

- Betsy's part took **18 minutes longer** than Donovan's part.
- The total time taken for the meal was **98 minutes**.

Let’s define:

- Let $ D $ be the time (in minutes) that **Donovan** spent on his part.
- Then, **Betsy**'s part is $ D + 18 $ minutes.

Since they worked together to make the meal, the total time is the sum of their individual times:

$$
D + (D + 18) = 98
$$

Simplify:

$$
2D + 18 = 98
$$

Subtract 18 from both sides:

$$
2D = 80
$$

Divide by 2:

$$
D = 40
$$

So, **Donovan's part** was 40 minutes.

Then, **Betsy's part** was:

$$
D + 18 = 40 + 18 = \boxed{58}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **58 minutes**.
Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Cast cost**:  
   $200 (fixed cost, no time involved)

2. **Doctor's visit cost**:  
   - Rate: $300/hour  
   - Time: 30 minutes = 0.5 hours  
   - Cost: $300 × 0.5 = **$150**

3. **Painkillers cost**:  
   - Rate: $4/pill  
   - Number of pills: 30  
   - Cost: $4 × 30 = **$120**

4. **Parking cost**:  
   - Rate: $6/hour  
   - Time: 2 hours (mandatory minimum)  
   - Cost: $6 × 2 = **$12**

Now, add all these together:

- Cast: $200  
- Doctor’s visit: $150  
- Painkillers: $120  
- Parking: $12  

**Total cost = $200 + $150 + $120 + $12 = $482**

### ✅ Final Answer: **$482**

### **Step 1: Determine how many pizzas the glee club ordered and ate**

- The glee club ordered **20 pizzas**.
- They ate **70%** of them.

So, the number of pizzas they ate is:

$$
0.70 \times 20 = 14 \text{ pizzas}
$$

Therefore, the number of pizzas **left** from the glee club is:

$$
20 - 14 = 6 \text{ pizzas}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many pizzas the football team ordered and ate**

- The football team ordered **twice as many** as the glee club, so:

$$
2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ pizzas}
$$

- They ate **80%** of them.

So, the number of pizzas they ate is:

$$
0.80 \times 40 = 32 \text{ pizzas}
$$

Therefore, the number of pizzas **left** from the football team is:

$$
40 - 32 = 8 \text{ pizzas}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add the leftover pizzas from both groups**

$$
6 \text{ (from glee club)} + 8 \text{ (from football team)} = 14 \text{ pizzas left}

### Step 1: How many meatball sub sandwiches did Sidney order initially?

> "Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches."

So:

$$
10 - 3 = 7 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches}
$$

---

### Step 2: How many meatballs are in those 7 sandwiches?

> "One meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs."

So:

$$
7 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs per sandwich} = 28 \text{ meatballs}
$$

---

### Step 3: How many of those sandwiches did Mark eat?

> "Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches."

So, 4 sandwiches were eaten. That means:

$$
28 \text{ meatballs} - (4 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs}) = 28 - 16 = 12 \text{ meatballs remaining}
$$

---

### Step 4: Did Sidney order more sandwiches?

> "Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches."

So, she ordered 3 more sandwiches. Each has 4 meatballs:

$$
3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ meatballs}
$$

---

### Step 5: Total meatballs that remained?

We had **12 meatballs** left from the first 7 sandwiches, and then Sidney added **12 more meatballs** from the new 3 sandwiches.

$$
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ meatballs}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{24}
$$

There are **24 meatballs** in the sub sandwiches that remained.

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the problem**

- Dennis needs to make **6 dozen croissants**.
- He uses **1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants**.
- So, he needs **6 pounds of butter** in total.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the promotion**

- The store has a **"buy one pound get one half off"** promotion.
- This means if you buy **1 pound**, you get **1 additional pound at half price**.
- So, for **every 2 pounds** of butter, you pay the full price for **1 pound**, and **half price for the second**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how many sets of 2 pounds can be bought**

Dennis needs **6 pounds** of butter.

- Each set of 2 pounds costs:
  - $4.00 for the first pound (full price),
  - $2.00 for the second pound (half price).
  - Total per set = **$6.00**.

How many such sets can he buy?

$$
\frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ sets}
$$

So, he will buy **3 sets** of 2 pounds each, which gives him **6 pounds** of butter.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the total cost**

Each set costs **$6.00**, and he buys **3 sets**:

$$
3 \times 6 = 18
$$

### ✅ **Final Answer: $18.00**
Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total cost of Kayla's birthday party.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the total number of guests**

Kayla invited:
- 25 classmates  
- 7 girls in her dance class  
- 13 family members  

Total invited = 25 + 7 + 13 = **45 people**

But **4 people said they could not come**, so:

**Number of people who actually came = 45 - 4 = 41 people**

---

### **Step 2: Understand the cost structure**

The theater rental fee is:
- **$125 for a party of 20 people**
- **$6 for each additional guest beyond 20**

So, the cost depends on how many people are at the party compared to the base 20.

We have **41 guests**, which is **21 more than 20**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total cost**

- Base fee for 20 people = **$125**
- Additional guests = 41 - 20 = **21 guests**
- Cost for additional guests = 21 × $6 = **$126**

**Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $251**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem

- **Maggie** spent **a quarter of her money**.
- **Riza** spent **one-third of her money**.
- Both of them had **$60** initially.
- We are to find out **how much money they have left** in total.

---

### Step 2: Find how much each spent

#### Maggie:
- She spent **1/4 of her money**.
- She had **$60**, so:
  $$
  \text{Amount Maggie spent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15
  $$
- So, Maggie has:
  $$
  60 - 15 = 45
  $$

#### Riza:
- She spent **1/3 of her money**.
- She also had **$60**, so:
  $$
  \text{Amount Riza spent} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
  $$
- So, Riza has:
  $$
  60 - 20 = 40
  $$

---

### Step 3: Add what they have left

$$
\text{Total money left} = 45 + 40 = 85
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{85}
$$
We are told:

- Mr. Robles has **315 bananas**, which is **enough to feed his three monkeys for a week** (7 days).
- **One monkey eats 10 bananas each day.**
- The **second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey**.
- The **third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day**.

We need to find how many bananas the **third monkey eats each day**.

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ x $ = number of bananas the **first monkey** eats per day
- $ x + 4 $ = number of bananas the **second monkey** eats per day
- $ y $ = number of bananas the **third monkey** eats per day

From the problem, we know:

- First monkey eats **10 bananas per day**, so:
  $$
  x = 10
  $$

- Second monkey eats:
  $$
  x + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ bananas per day}
  $$

- Third monkey eats the **rest** of the bananas per day, so:
  $$
  y = \text{total per day} - (\text{first} + \text{second}) = 10 + 14 - y = 24 - y
  $$

Wait — that's not quite right. Let me rephrase.

The total number of bananas eaten by all three monkeys **per day** is:
$$
x + (x + 4) + y = 10 + 14 + y = 24 + y
$$

But this must be the **total per day**, and we know that the **total number of bananas is enough for a week**, i.e., 7 days.

So the **total number of bananas used in a week** is:
$$
\text{Total bananas} = 315 = 7 \times (\text{bananas per day})
$$

So:
$$
\text{Bananas per day} = \frac{315}{7} = 45
$$

So each day, the three monkeys eat **45 bananas** in total.

Now, since the first two monkeys eat 10 and 14 bananas per day, the third monkey must eat:
$$
y = 45 - (10 + 14) = 45 - 24 = 21
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{21}
$$

The third monkey eats **21 bananas each day**.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand what was done

- **First puzzle**: Teddy finished **half** of a **500-piece puzzle**.
  - So, he placed **half of 500 pieces**, which is:
    $$
    \frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ pieces}
    $$

- **Second puzzle**: He then **started and finished another 500-piece puzzle** within an hour.
  - That means he placed **all 500 pieces** of this second puzzle.

---

### Step 2: Add the number of pieces placed

- From the first puzzle: **250 pieces**
- From the second puzzle: **500 pieces**

So, the total number of puzzle pieces Teddy placed during that hour is:
$$
250 + 500 = \boxed{750}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **750 puzzle pieces**.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many **quarters** Jenny leaves with.

---

### Step 1: Understand the cost of roses

- **Roses cost $2 each**.
- Or, **$15 for a dozen (12 roses)**.

Jenny buys **15 roses**.

We need to calculate the total cost of 15 roses. Let’s try both methods:

#### Option A: Buy 12 roses at $15
- That’s 12 roses for $15.
- Then she needs **3 more roses** at $2 each = $6.

So total cost = $15 + $6 = **$21**

#### Option B: Buy all 15 roses at $2 each
- 15 × $2 = **$30**

So depending on which deal she used, the cost is either **$21 or $30**.

But we are told she **arrived with five $5 bills**, and the florist only gives **change in quarters**.

So let’s assume she paid with **five $5 bills**, which is **$25 total**.

That means she must have given **$25** to the florist, and received **change back** in quarters.

Now we can find out how much change she got back.

---

### Step 2: Determine how much change she received

She gave the florist **$25**.

If the cost of the roses was **$21**, then the change is:

$$
25 - 21 = 4 \text{ dollars}
$$

If the cost of the roses was **$30**, then she would have given **$25**, which is **less than the cost**, so she would not be able to buy 15 roses that way.

So the only possible way is that she used the **$15 for a dozen** deal, and bought 3 more roses at $2 each.

So total cost = **$21**

Change received = $25 - $21 = **$4**

---

### Step 3: Convert the change into quarters

- Each quarter is **$0.25**
- So, $4 ÷ $0.25 = **16 quarters**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.**
Let's calculate the total amount of money Terry makes from each item and then add them all together.

---

### 1. **Milkshakes**
- Number sold: 6  
- Price per milkshake: $5.50  
- Total from milkshakes:  
  $$
  6 \times 5.50 = 33.00
  $$

---

### 2. **Burger platters**
- Number sold: 9  
- Price per platter: $11  
- Total from burger platters:  
  $$
  9 \times 11 = 99.00
  $$

---

### 3. **Sodas**
- Number sold: 20  
- Price per soda: $1.50  
- Total from sodas:  
  $$
  20 \times 1.50 = 30.00
  $$

---

### 4. **Total Money Made**
Now, add up the totals from each item:

$$
33.00 + 99.00 + 30.00 = 162.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Terry makes $162.00 in total.**
Let's go step by step to determine **how long Paul will wait for his train**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the schedule

We are told that:

- **First train** arrives in **10 minutes** and stays for **20 minutes**.
- **Second train** arrives **half an hour (30 minutes)** after the **first train leaves**, and stays for **a quarter of the first train’s stay time**.
- **Third train** arrives **an hour (60 minutes)** after the **second train leaves**, and **leaves immediately** upon arrival.
- **Fourth train** arrives **20 minutes after the third train leaves**, and this is the one **Paul will board**.

We need to find out **how long Paul waits** for his train (the fourth one).

---

### Step 2: Let’s assign times to each event

Let’s define:

- **T1**: First train
- **T2**: Second train
- **T3**: Third train
- **T4**: Fourth train (Paul’s train)

#### T1:
- Arrives in **10 minutes**
- Stays for **20 minutes**

So, it departs at **10 + 20 = 30 minutes**

#### T2:
- Arrives **30 minutes after T1 leaves** → 30 + 30 = **60 minutes**
- Stays for **quarter of T1’s stay time** = 20 / 4 = **5 minutes**

So, T2 departs at **60 + 5 = 65 minutes**

#### T3:
- Arrives **60 minutes after T2 leaves** → 65 + 60 = **125 minutes**
- Leaves **immediately** upon arrival → So T3 departs at **125 minutes**

#### T4:
- Arrives **20 minutes after T3 leaves** → 125 + 20 = **145 minutes**

So, **T4 arrives at 145 minutes**.

---

### Step 3: How long does Paul wait?

Paul is waiting at the station from the moment he arrives until the **fourth train arrives**.

He doesn’t know when he arrives, but we can assume he arrives **at the same time as the first train** (since he’s waiting for the train), so:

- He arrives at **time 0**
- The **fourth train arrives at 145 minutes**

So, **Paul waits 145 minutes**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{145}
$$

Paul will wait **145 minutes** for his train.
Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: How many toothpicks has Melanie already saved?**

- She saves **10 toothpicks per week**.
- She has been saving for **12 weeks**.

So, the number of toothpicks she has saved so far is:

$$
10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks}
$$

---

### **Step 2: How many more toothpicks does she need?**

The sculpture requires **200 toothpicks**, and she already has **120**.

$$
200 - 120 = 80 \text{ toothpicks needed}
$$

---

### **Step 3: At what rate is she saving toothpicks?**

She saves **10 toothpicks per week**.

---

### **Step 4: How many more weeks will it take to save 80 toothpicks?**

$$
\frac{80 \text{ toothpicks}}{10 \text{ toothpicks/week}} = 8 \text{ weeks}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

It will take Melanie **8 more weeks** to collect 200 toothpicks.
We are given the following information:

- The **original price** of the watch is **$2000**.
- Mr. Rogers **bought** it at **75% of its original price**.
- He then **sold** it to his friend at **120% of the price he bought it**.
- We are asked to find the **percentage discount** that Mr. Roger's friend received **from the original price**.

---

### Step 1: Find the price Mr. Rogers paid

He bought the watch at 75% of the original price:

$$
\text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 0.75 \times 2000 = 1500
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the price Mr. Rogers sold it for

He sold it at 120% of the price he bought it:

$$
\text{Selling price} = 1.20 \times 1500 = 1800
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the **discount** from the original price

The original price was $2000, and Mr. Roger's friend paid $1800.

So the **discount amount** is:

$$
\text{Discount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200
$$

---

### Step 4: Find the **percentage discount** from the original price

$$
\text{Percentage discount} = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{10\%}
$$

Mr. Roger's friend received a **10% discount** from the original price.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the rate of one spring**

- The problem says: **"Every second, a bubbling spring creates a new jellyfish."**
- So, **1 jellyfish per second** is created by one spring.

---

### **Step 2: Find out how many seconds are in 4 hours**

- There are **60 seconds in a minute**, and **60 minutes in an hour**.
- So, in 1 hour:
  $$
  60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 3600 \text{ seconds}
  $$
- In 4 hours:
  $$
  4 \text{ hours} \times 3600 \text{ seconds/hour} = 14,400 \text{ seconds}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: How many jellyfish does one spring create in 4 hours?**

- If 1 jellyfish is created every second, then in 14,400 seconds:
  $$
  14,400 \text{ jellyfish}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: How many jellyfish do 5 springs create in 4 hours?**

- Each spring creates 14,400 jellyfish in 4 hours.
- So, 5 springs would create:
  $$
  5 \times 14,400 = 72,000 \text{ jellyfish}
  $$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{72,000} \text{ jellyfish}
$$
We are given the following information:

- Binkie's score is **90**.
- Frankie's score is **15 more than twice** Binkie's score.

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find twice Binkie's score

Binkie's score = 90  
Twice Binkie's score = $ 2 \times 90 = 180 $

---

### Step 2: Add 15 to that result

Frankie's score = $ 180 + 15 = 195 $

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Frankie's score was 195.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Given:
- Distance from **home to store**: 4 miles
- James walks at a speed of **4 miles per hour**
- He walks **halfway** to the store, then turns around and walks **back home**, and then goes to the store again.

We are asked: **How long did it take him to reach the store?**

---

### Step 1: Distance to halfway point

He walks **halfway** to the store:

$$
\text{Halfway distance} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 2: Time to walk halfway

He walks 2 miles at 4 mph:

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
$$

So, he takes **0.5 hours** (or 30 minutes) to get to the halfway point.

---

### Step 3: He turns back home

Now he walks **back home**, which is another 2 miles.

$$
\text{Time to walk back} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
$$

So, he takes another **0.5 hours** to return home.

---

### Step 4: He starts again to the store

Now he leaves home and walks to the store again — **4 miles total**.

$$
\text{Time to walk to store} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \text{ hour}
$$

---

### Step 5: Total time

Add up all the times:

- To halfway: 0.5 hours  
- Back home: 0.5 hours  
- From home to store: 1 hour  

$$
\text{Total time} = 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 2 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{2 \text{ hours}}
$$
We are given:

- **Bananas cost $0.80 each** (individual price).
- **A bunch of bananas costs $3.00**.
- **Jenny buys 10 bunches**, and **each bunch averages 4 bananas**.

---

### Step 1: Find the total number of bananas Jenny buys

Each bunch has an average of 4 bananas, and she buys 10 bunches:

$$
\text{Total bananas} = 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ bananas}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the cost if she bought all bananas individually

At $0.80 per banana:

$$
\text{Total cost individually} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the cost if she bought all bananas in bunches

She buys 10 bunches at $3.00 per bunch:

$$
\text{Total cost in bunches} = 10 \times 3.00 = 30.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Calculate the savings

$$
\text{Savings} = \text{Cost individually} - \text{Cost in bunches} = 32.00 - 30.00 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{2}
$$

Jenny saved **$2.00** by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.
We are told that **Sam and Harry** have **100 feet of fence** between them, and they agree to **split it**, with **Harry getting 60 feet more than Sam**.

We are asked: **How much is left over for Sam?**

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s let:

- $ S $ = amount of fence Sam gets (in feet)
- $ H $ = amount of fence Harry gets (in feet)

From the problem:

- Total fence = 100 feet
- Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam:  
  $$
  H = S + 60
  $$

Also:

$$
S + H = 100
$$

---

### Step 2: Substitute the expression for $ H $ into the total equation

$$
S + (S + 60) = 100
$$

$$
2S + 60 = 100
$$

$$
2S = 40
$$

$$
S = 20
$$

---

### Step 3: Find how much is left over for Sam

Since Sam gets **20 feet**, and the total fence is **100 feet**, the **leftover** would be:

$$
100 - (S + H) = 100 - 100 = 0
$$

But wait — this is not correct. We need to clarify what is meant by "how much is left over for Sam."

Actually, since **Sam gets 20 feet**, and **Harry gets 80 feet**, then **no fence is left over** — the total is exactly 100 feet.

So, the answer is:

$$
\boxed{0}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{0}
$$

There is **no leftover fence** for Sam.
We are given that a crocodile grows **8 inches** in **4 years**.

We need to find out how many inches it will grow in **13 years** at the same rate.

---

### Step 1: Find the growth rate per year

$$
\text{Growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
$$

---

### Step 2: Multiply the growth rate by 13 years

$$
\text{Total growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{26} \text{ inches}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much Marcel earned from selling bicycles in one month.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the bike prices**

- **MTB**: $500  
- **BMX**: Half the price of MTB → $500 ÷ 2 = **$250**  
- **Trekking**: $450

---

### **Step 2: Total number of bikes sold**

Marcel sold a total of **300 bikes**.

---

### **Step 3: Break down the number of each type of bike sold**

We are told:

- **Half of them were Trekking bikes** →  
  $ \frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150 $ **Trekking bikes**

- **15% were BMX bikes** →  
  $ 0.15 \times 300 = 45 $ **BMX bikes**

- The rest were **MTB bikes** →  
  $ 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 $ **MTB bikes**

---

### **Step 4: Calculate earnings from each type**

- **MTB**:  
  $ 105 \text{ bikes} \times 500 = 52,500 $

- **BMX**:  
  $ 45 \text{ bikes} \times 250 = 11,250 $

- **Trekking**:  
  $ 150 \text{ bikes} \times 450 = 67,500 $

---

### **Step 5: Add up all earnings**

$$
\text{Total Earnings} = 52,500 + 11,250 + 67,500 = \boxed{131,250}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- The **farmer** makes **5 bales per hour**.
- The **truck** picks up **3 bales per hour**.
- Both work for a **6-hour day**.

---

### **Step 1: Total bales made by the farmer in 6 hours**

$$
\text{Farmer's rate} = 5 \text{ bales/hour}
$$
$$
\text{Total bales made} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ bales}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Total bales picked up by the truck in 6 hours**

$$
\text{Truck's rate} = 3 \text{ bales/hour}
$$
$$
\text{Total bales picked up} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ bales}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Bales remaining in the field**

$$
\text{Bales left} = \text{Bales made} - \text{Bales picked up}
$$
$$
\text{Bales left} = 30 - 18 = \boxed{12}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 12 bales of hay are left in the field.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out **how many hours per week John spends learning**.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many classes John takes in a week**

- A normal student has **6 periods per day**.
- John has **2 extra classes**, so he has **6 + 2 = 8 classes per day**.
- He goes to class **5 days a week**.

So, total number of classes per week:

$$
8 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ classes/week}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the total minutes spent in class per week**

- Each class is **40 minutes long**.

$$
40 \text{ classes/week} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Convert class time to hours**

$$
1600 \text{ minutes} = \frac{1600}{60} = 26.\overline{6} \text{ hours} \approx 26.67 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday**

He spends **1/16 of his weekly minutes** (from classes) on **extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday**.

First, let’s compute **1/16 of his weekly class time in minutes**:

$$
\frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100 \text{ minutes}
$$

Convert that to hours:

$$
\frac{100}{60} = 1.\overline{6} \text{ hours} \approx 1.67 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Total learning time per week**

$$
26.67 \text{ hours (class)} + 1.67 \text{ hours (extra)} = 28.34 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{28.34} \text{ hours per week}
$$

Or, if you prefer an exact fraction:

- Class time: $ \frac{1600}{60} = \frac{80}{3} $
- Extra time: $ \frac{100}{60} = \frac{5}{3} $

Total:

$$
\frac{80}{3} + \frac{5}{3} = \frac{85}{3} \approx 28.33 \text{ hours}
$$

So, the answer is:

$$
\boxed{\frac{85}{3}} \text{ hours per week}
$$

Or approximately:

$$
\boxed{28.33} \text{ hours per week}
$$
We are told that Nathan drops a bouncy ball from the **third-floor balcony**, and each bounce makes it reach **2/3 of its previous height**.

---

### Step 1: Determine the initial height

- The **third floor** is **24 feet high**.
- So, the ball is dropped from **24 feet**.

---

### Step 2: First bounce

After the first bounce, the ball reaches:

$$
\frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### Step 3: Second bounce

After the second bounce, the ball reaches:

$$
\frac{2}{3} \times 16 = \frac{32}{3} \approx 10.67 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{10.\overline{6} \text{ feet}} \quad \text{or} \quad \boxed{\frac{32}{3} \text{ feet}}
$$

So, the ball goes **$\frac{32}{3}$ feet high on its second bounce**, which is approximately **10.67 feet**.
We are given the heights of Caroline's 4 children, and we need to find the height of the **fourth child** in **inches**.

---

### Step 1: Convert the first child's height to inches

- The first child is **6 feet tall**.
- Since 1 foot = 12 inches,  
  $$
  6 \text{ feet} = 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches}
  $$

So, the **first child is 72 inches tall**.

---

### Step 2: Second child is 2 inches taller than the first

$$
\text{Second child} = 72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 3: Third child is 5 inches shorter than the second

$$
\text{Third child} = 74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 4: Fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third

$$
\text{Fourth child} = 69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{72} \text{ inches}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many bags of apples were sold.
The orchard sells apples in **bags of 10**, and they sold a total of **2000 apples**.

So, the number of bags is:

$$
\frac{2000 \text{ apples}}{10 \text{ apples per bag}} = 200 \text{ bags}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings.
Each bag is sold for **$5**.

So, the total earnings are:

$$
200 \text{ bags} \times 5 \text{ dollars per bag} = 1000 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
The orchard earned **$1000**.
We are told:

- A **Tyrannosaurus rex** ate **half** of a small triceratops.
- Then, a pack of **velociraptors** scavenged **half of what was left**.
- Finally, a group of **Allosaurus** ate the **last 270 kg** of meat.

We need to find the **original amount of meat** on the triceratops before the T-Rex started eating.

---

### Step-by-step breakdown:

Let’s denote the **original amount of meat** as $ x $ kilograms.

1. **T-Rex eats half of it:**
   - Amount eaten by T-Rex = $ \frac{1}{2}x $
   - Remaining meat = $ x - \frac{1}{2}x = \frac{1}{2}x $

2. **Velociraptors eat half of what's left:**
   - What's left after T-Rex = $ \frac{1}{2}x $
   - Velociraptors eat $ \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2}x = \frac{1}{4}x $
   - Remaining meat = $ \frac{1}{2}x - \frac{1}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x $

3. **Allosaurus eat the last 270 kg:**
   - This is the remaining meat: $ \frac{1}{4}x = 270 $

Now solve for $ x $:

$$
\frac{1}{4}x = 270 \\
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**1080 kilograms** of meat were on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate.
We are given the dimensions of the four walls in a room and asked to calculate the **cost to paint the room**, given that:

- **North and South walls**: 10 ft × 8 ft  
- **East and West walls**: 5 ft × 8 ft  
- **Paint coverage**: 1 gallon covers **20 square feet**  
- **Cost per gallon**: **$12**

---

### Step 1: Calculate the area of each wall

#### North Wall:
$$
10 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} = 80 \, \text{sq ft}
$$

#### South Wall:
Same as North:
$$
80 \, \text{sq ft}
$$

#### East Wall:
$$
5 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} = 40 \, \text{sq ft}
$$

#### West Wall:
Same as East:
$$
40 \, \text{sq ft}
$$

---

### Step 2: Total area of all walls

$$
80 + 80 + 40 + 40 = 240 \, \text{sq ft}
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine how many gallons of paint are needed

Each gallon covers **20 sq ft**, so:

$$
\frac{240}{20} = 12 \, \text{gallons}
$$

---

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost

$$
12 \, \text{gallons} \times \$12/\text{gallon} = \$144
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**It will cost $144 to paint the room.**
Let's go through the problem step by step and calculate the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a **shaken can**.

---

### **Step 1: Total sodas and their types**

- Ellen has a case of **12 sodas**.
- She **shook up 3 of them**, so:
  - **Shaken sodas**: 3
  - **Unshaken sodas**: 12 - 3 = **9**

---

### **Step 2: Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself**

- So now, the remaining sodas are:
  - Shaken: 3
  - Unshaken: 9 - 1 = **8**

---

### **Step 3: Ellen's brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas**

- He takes:
  - 1 shaken soda → Remaining shaken: 3 - 1 = **2**
  - 2 unshaken sodas → Remaining unshaken: 8 - 2 = **6**

So now, after Ellen and her brother have taken their sodas, we're left with:

- **Shaken sodas**: 2
- **Unshaken sodas**: 6

Total remaining sodas = 2 + 6 = **8**

---

### **Step 4: Ellen's friend comes along and picks one soda at random**

We want to find the **probability that the friend picks a shaken soda**, which would result in being sprayed.

There are **2 shaken sodas** and **6 unshaken sodas**, so total of **8 sodas**.

The probability that the friend picks a **shaken soda** is:

$$
P(\text{shaken}) = \frac{\text{Number of shaken sodas}}{\text{Total number of sodas}} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Convert to percentage**

$$
\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 = 25\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**25%** chance that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the problem**

- Two trains depart from the **same station**.
- They are traveling in **opposite directions**.
- One train is going at **60 miles per hour (mph)**.
- The other train is going at **half that speed**, so:
  
  $$
  \text{Speed of second train} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ mph}
  $$

- We are asked how far apart they are after **3 hours**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the distance each train travels in 3 hours**

- Distance = Speed × Time

#### For the first train (60 mph):
$$
\text{Distance}_1 = 60 \times 3 = 180 \text{ miles}
$$

#### For the second train (30 mph):
$$
\text{Distance}_2 = 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add the distances since they're moving in opposite directions**

Because the trains are moving away from each other, their distances add up:

$$
\text{Total distance apart} = 180 + 90 = 270 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{270} \text{ miles}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many people Billy helps.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of days between March 1st and April 19th**

- March has **31 days**.
- April 19th is the day we're considering (inclusive).
- So, from **March 1st to April 19th**, that’s:

$$
31 \text{ (days in March)} + 19 = 50 \text{ days}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Days Billy is off**

He takes **20% of these days off**.

$$
20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days off}
$$

So, he works:

$$
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ days}
$$

---

### **Step 3: How many people does Billy help per day?**

He helps **2 people per hour**, and works **3 hours a day**.

$$
2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total number of people helped**

$$
6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{240}
$$

Billy helps **240 people**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**

- **Number of private cars:** 20  
- **Number of buses:** 12  
- **Each bus carries:** 35 people  
- **Each car carries:** 3 people  

We are asked to find **how many people were inside the church** after the ceremony.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the total number of people carried by buses**

$$
\text{Total people in buses} = \text{Number of buses} \times \text{People per bus} = 12 \times 35 = 420
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total number of people carried by cars**

$$
\text{Total people in cars} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{People per car} = 20 \times 3 = 60
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add the people from buses and cars**

$$
\text{Total people} = 420 + 60 = 480
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{480}
$$

So, **480 people** were inside the church.
We are given the following information:

1. **Jeff is 10 years older than his younger sister, Martha.**
2. **Martha is 4 years younger than her boyfriend, Mike.**
3. **Mike is 24 years old.**

Let’s work step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find Martha's age

We know that **Martha is 4 years younger than Mike**, and **Mike is 24 years old**.

$$
\text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4 = 24 - 4 = 20
$$

So, **Martha is 20 years old**.

---

### Step 2: Find Jeff's age

We know that **Jeff is 10 years older than Martha**.

$$
\text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{30}
$$

**Jeff is 30 years old.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find the time it takes to slide down the biggest waterslide**

- **Length of the biggest slide:** 300 feet  
- **Speed:** 60 feet per minute

Time = Distance ÷ Speed  
$$
\text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the time it takes to slide down the second biggest waterslide**

- **Length of the second biggest slide:** 240 feet  
- **Speed:** 80 feet per minute

$$
\text{Time}_{\text{second}} = \frac{240}{80} = 3 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the difference in time**

$$
\text{Difference} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second}} = 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

It takes **2 minutes longer** to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the total time per day for lunch and breaks

- **Lunch:** 30 minutes  
- **Breaks:** 2 × 15 minutes = 30 minutes  

So, **total time per day** = 30 minutes (lunch) + 30 minutes (breaks) = **60 minutes per day**

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total time over 5 days

- 60 minutes/day × 5 days = **300 minutes**

---

### Step 3: Convert minutes to hours

- 300 minutes ÷ 60 = **5 hours**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **5 hours**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total miles run by all three**
Amber, Micah, and Ahito ran a total of **52 miles**.

---

### **Step 2: Miles run by Amber**
Amber ran **8 miles**.

---

### **Step 3: Miles run by Micah**
Micah ran **3.5 times what Amber ran**.

So:
$$
\text{Micah's distance} = 3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Miles run by Ahito**
We know the total is 52 miles, and we already know how far Amber and Micah ran:

$$
\text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (\text{Amber} + \text{Micah}) = 52 - (8 + 28) = 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Ahito ran 16 miles.**
Let's go step by step to calculate the **new balance** on Sheila's credit card.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Charge**

Sheila initially charged:

$$
\$85.00
$$

---

### **Step 2: Return One Item**

She returned an item that cost:

$$
\$15.00
$$

So, this reduces the balance by \$15.00:

$$
\$85.00 - \$15.00 = \$70.00
$$

---

### **Step 3: Purchase of Frying Pan (20% off $20.00)**

The original price is \$20.00, and it's **20% off**.

$$
\text{Discount} = 20\% \times 20.00 = 0.20 \times 20.00 = \$4.00
$$

$$
\text{New price} = 20.00 - 4.00 = \$16.00
$$

---

### **Step 4: Purchase of Towels (10% off $30.00)**

The original price is \$30.00, and it's **10% off**.

$$
\text{Discount} = 10\% \times 30.00 = 0.10 \times 30.00 = \$3.00
$$

$$
\text{New price} = 30.00 - 3.00 = \$27.00
$$

---

### **Step 5: Add New Purchases to the Balance**

Now add the prices of the frying pan and towels to the current balance:

$$
\text{Current balance before new purchases} = \$70.00
$$

$$
\text{New purchases} = \$16.00 + \$27.00 = \$43.00
$$

$$
\text{New balance} = 70.00 + 43.00 = \$113.00
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$113.00}
$$
We are given the following information:

- A fifth of the jellyfish are **large**.
- A third of the **large** jellyfish change color from green to blue **under UV light**.
- The **other** jellyfish (not large) are **small** and **always stay blue**.
- When the **UV light is turned on**, **6 jellyfish changed color**.

We are asked to find: **How many jellyfish are in the tank?**

---

### Step 1: Let the total number of jellyfish be $ x $.

Then:
- Number of **large** jellyfish = $ \frac{1}{5}x $
- Number of **small** jellyfish = $ x - \frac{1}{5}x = \frac{4}{5}x $

---

### Step 2: How many large jellyfish change color?

A third of the large jellyfish change color under UV light:

$$
\text{Large jellyfish that change color} = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}x = \frac{1}{15}x
$$

We are told that **6 jellyfish changed color**. So:

$$
\frac{1}{15}x = 6
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = 6 \times 15 = 90
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{90}
$$

There are **90 jellyfish** in the tank.
We are given the following relationships:

1. **Caroline is three times older than Ben.**
2. **Ben is two times older than Chris.**
3. **Chris is 4 years old.**

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find Ben's age

We are told:
> **Ben is two times older than Chris**, and **Chris is 4**.

So, Ben's age = 2 × Chris's age = 2 × 4 = **8 years old**.

---

### Step 2: Find Caroline's age

We are told:
> **Caroline is three times older than Ben**, and **Ben is 8**.

So, Caroline's age = 3 × Ben's age = 3 × 8 = **24 years old**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Caroline is 24 years old.**
Let's break down the problem step by step to determine **how many more years Lauren needs to work** if she plans to save for a **retirement period of 20 years**, and she wants to **live on 40% of her current annual salary**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the savings plan**

- **Current salary**: $100,000 per year
- **Savings rate**: 20% of every paycheck → So she saves **$20,000 per year**
- **Retirement period**: 20 years
- **Desired lifestyle in retirement**: 40% of current salary → $100,000 × 0.40 = **$40,000 per year**

So, in retirement, she needs **$40,000 per year** for 20 years.

---

### **Step 2: Total amount needed for retirement**

She needs $40,000 per year for 20 years:

$$
\text{Total needed} = 40,000 \times 20 = \$800,000
$$

---

### **Step 3: How much she saves each year**

She saves 20% of her salary:

$$
\text{Annual savings} = 100,000 \times 0.20 = \$20,000
$$

---

### **Step 4: How many years does it take to save $800,000?**

$$
\text{Years needed} = \frac{\text{Total needed}}{\text{Annual savings}} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Interpret the question**

The question asks: **"How many more years does Lauren need to work if she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years..."**

This means she **needs to save for 20 years of retirement**, and she currently is **not yet retired**.

But the question doesn't say how long she has already been working. It just asks **how many more years she needs to work** to save enough for 20 years of retirement.

So, based on the calculation above, she needs to save **$800,000**, which will take **40 years** of saving $20,000 per year.

Therefore, **Lauren needs to work for 40 years** to save enough for 20 years of retirement.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 40 years**
We are given that Marty has **100 centimeters of ribbon** and he must cut it into **4 equal parts**, and then each of those parts must be divided into **5 equal parts**. We need to find the length of each **final cut**.

---

### Step 1: Divide the ribbon into 4 equal parts

Total length = 100 cm  
Number of parts = 4

So, each part is:

$$
\frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
$$

---

### Step 2: Divide each 25 cm part into 5 equal parts

Now we take each 25 cm piece and divide it into 5 equal parts.

$$
\frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Each final cut will be **5 centimeters long**.
We are told:

- 40% of the school population is made up of **boys**.
- There are **240 boys**.

We need to find the **total number of girls** in the school.

---

### Step 1: Find the total number of students

Let the total number of students be $ x $.

We know that 40% of the students are boys, and that equals 240:

$$
0.4x = 240
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
x = \frac{240}{0.4} = 600
$$

So, the total number of students in the school is **600**.

---

### Step 2: Find the number of girls

Total students = 600  
Number of boys = 240  
So, number of girls = Total - Boys

$$
\text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 = 360
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**There are 360 girls in the school.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Cost of the pots**: $19  
2. **Cost of the sack of garden soil**: $26  
3. **Total before discount**:  
   $19 + $26 = **$45**

4. **Coupon discount**: $7 off  
   So, subtract the coupon from the total:  
   $45 - $7 = **$38**

### Final Answer:  
**My mom spent $38 at the gardening shop.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Given:
- **Three women** are wearing **4-inch heels**.
- **Three women** are wearing **2-inch heels**.

We are asked to find the **average height of heels** at the party.

---

### Step 1: Total number of women
There are:
$$
3 \text{ (with 4-inch heels)} + 3 \text{ (with 2-inch heels)} = 6 \text{ women}
$$

---

### Step 2: Total height of heels
- The total height from the 4-inch heels is:
$$
3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ inches}
$$
- The total height from the 2-inch heels is:
$$
3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches}
$$
- So, the **total heel height** is:
$$
12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 3: Average heel height
$$
\text{Average heel height} = \frac{\text{Total heel height}}{\text{Number of women}} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{3} \text{ inches}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the goal**

Soledad wants to **hike 9,300 miles** in **June**, which has **30 days** (assuming it's not a leap year).

So, she needs to hike:

$$
\frac{9,300 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 310 \text{ miles per day}
$$

---

### **Step 2: How much is she currently planning to hike?**

She plans to walk **twice a day**, **125 miles each time**:

$$
2 \times 125 = 250 \text{ miles per day}
$$

---

### **Step 3: How many more miles per day does she need to hike?**

$$
310 \text{ miles/day} - 250 \text{ miles/day} = 60 \text{ miles/day}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Soledad must hike 60 more miles per day to complete her journey on time.**
We are given the following information:

- **Red balls**: 3 balls, each costing $9  
- **Blue balls**: 11 balls, each costing $5  
- **Green balls**: 25 balls, each costing $3  

We need to calculate the total amount of money the store will receive after selling all the balls.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost for each color of ball

#### Red balls:
$$
3 \text{ balls} \times \$9 = \$27
$$

#### Blue balls:
$$
11 \text{ balls} \times \$5 = \$55
$$

#### Green balls:
$$
25 \text{ balls} \times \$3 = \$75
$$

---

### Step 2: Add up the totals

$$
\$27 + \$55 + \$75 = \$157
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$157}
$$

The store will have received **$157** after all the balls are sold.
Let's go through the problem step by step.

### Given:
- Total apples = **12 kg**
- **Pierre** wants **a quarter** of that:  
  $$
  \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
  $$
- **Paul** wants **one-third** of that:  
  $$
  \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
  $$

Now, we need to find out how much **James** will have **left**.

First, let's add up what Pierre and Paul want:

$$
3 \text{ kg (Pierre)} + 4 \text{ kg (Paul)} = 7 \text{ kg}
$$

So, the total amount taken by Pierre and Paul is **7 kg**.

Now subtract that from the total amount of apples:

$$
12 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 5 \text{ kg}
$$

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{5} \text{ kg}
$$

So, **James will have 5 kg of apples left.**
Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Initial temperature**: 2 degrees Celsius.

2. **Temperature drop**: It dropped 8 degrees Celsius overnight.  
   So, subtract 8 from the initial temperature:  
   $ 2 - 8 = -6 $ degrees Celsius.

3. **Temperature increase in the morning**: It increased 3 degrees Celsius.  
   So, add 3 to the temperature after the drop:  
   $ -6 + 3 = -3 $ degrees Celsius.

### Final Answer: **-3 degrees Celsius**.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

**Initial amount Raymond has:**  
$$ \$21 $$

---

**He saves $11 from his allowance:**  
$$ \$21 + \$11 = \$32 $$

---

**He spends $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle:**  
Total spent:  
$$ \$5 + \$19 = \$24 $$

Now subtract that from the total he had after saving:  
$$ \$32 - \$24 = \$8 $$

---

**Final answer:**  
$$ \boxed{\$8} $$

Raymond has **\$8** left.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the total budget and what has been spent

- **Total budget**: $16  
- **Amount already spent**: $4  
- **Amount left**: $2  

So, the amount **spent on the two books** is:

$$
\text{Spent on books} = \text{Total budget} - \text{Already spent} - \text{Left}
$$

$$
\text{Spent on books} = 16 - 4 - 2 = 10
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the cost of each book

Anna bought **2 books**, and both cost the **same amount**. So:

$$
\text{Cost per book} = \frac{\text{Total spent on books}}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Each book cost **$5**.

$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{60}
$$

So, **60 students** are enrolled this year in the calligraphy class.
We are told that the lighthouse light blinks **255 times in 5 minutes**, and we need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink **459 times**.

---

### Step 1: Find the blinking rate (blinks per minute)

$$
\text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the rate to find the time for 459 blinks

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}} = 9 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{9 \text{ minutes}}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Count the original number of male and female fish**

- **Male guppies**: 4  
- **Female guppies**: 7  
- **Male goldfishes**: 3  
- **Female goldfishes**: 5  

**Total males originally** = 4 (male guppies) + 3 (male goldfishes) = **7 males**  
**Total females originally** = 7 (female guppies) + 5 (female goldfishes) = **12 females**

---

### **Step 2: Add the new fish that Tate buys**

- **Male guppies added**: 2  
- **Female guppies added**: 1  
- **Male goldfishes added**: 2  
- **Female goldfishes added**: 3  

**New total males** = 7 (original) + 2 (new male guppies) + 2 (new male goldfishes) = **11 males**  
**New total females** = 12 (original) + 1 (new female guppy) + 3 (new female goldfishes) = **16 females**

---

### **Step 3: Find how many more female fish than male fish**

$$
\text{Difference} = \text{Females} - \text{Males} = 16 - 11 = \boxed{5}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 5 more female fishes than male fishes.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information

- **Amalia** mows the lawn and takes **4 hours**.
- **Megan** walks the dog and it takes her **2 hours longer** than Amalia.
- **Dior** does laundry and it takes her **well over 4 hours longer** than Amalia.

We are asked to find the **total time they all took to do their chores**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate each person’s time

#### Amalia:
- Time = **4 hours**

#### Megan:
- Time = Amalia's time + 2 hours  
  = 4 + 2 = **6 hours**

#### Dior:
- Time = Amalia's time + more than 4 hours  
  = 4 + (more than 4) = **more than 8 hours**

But wait — the problem says **"well over 4 hours longer"**, which is a bit ambiguous. However, in most math problems like this, "well over 4 hours longer" is interpreted as **exactly 4 hours longer**, unless stated otherwise.

So we'll assume:

- Dior's time = 4 + 4 = **8 hours**

---

### Step 3: Add up the total time

- Amalia: 4 hours  
- Megan: 6 hours  
- Dior: 8 hours  

Total time = 4 + 6 + 8 = **18 hours**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**The total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 18 hours.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Time to drive one way**
- John drives **2 hours** to his parents' house.
- So, the **one-way driving time** is **2 hours**.

---

### **Step 2: Round trip driving time**
- A round trip means going **there and back**, so:
  
  $$
  \text{Round trip time} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 4 \text{ hours}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Speed of the car**
- John drives at **70 mph**.

---

### **Step 4: Distance for one round trip**
- Use the formula:

  $$
  \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
  $$

  $$
  \text{Distance per round trip} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 280 \, \text{miles}
  $$

---

### **Step 5: Number of visits per month**
- John visits his parents **twice a month**.

---

### **Step 6: Total distance per month**
$$
\text{Total distance per month} = 280 \, \text{miles/visit} \times 2 \, \text{visits/month} = 560 \, \text{miles/month}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

**John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- Sofie walks **10 miles every day**.
- In **7 days**, Sofie will walk **twice as far as Brian**.

We are asked to find how many miles **Brian** will walk in **7 days**.

---

### **Step 1: Find how far Sofie walks in 7 days.**

Sofie walks 10 miles per day for 7 days:

$$
\text{Distance Sofie walks} = 10 \times 7 = 70 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Use the relationship between Sofie and Brian.**

We're told that in 7 days, Sofie walks **twice as far as Brian**.

So:

$$
\text{Distance Sofie walks} = 2 \times \text{Distance Brian walks}
$$

Substitute in the value we found:

$$
70 = 2 \times \text{Distance Brian walks}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for Brian's distance.**

$$
\text{Distance Brian walks} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{35} \text{ miles}
$$

Brian will walk **35 miles** in 7 days.
We are given the following information:

- The manufacturer needs **400 toys**.
- **5 workers** are working on the order.
- **2 workers** produce **6 toys per hour**.
- **Another 2 workers** produce **4 toys per hour**.
- They all work for **10 hours**.
- After their shift, **20 more toys are still needed**.

We are to find: **How many toys per hour does the fifth worker produce?**

---

### Step 1: Calculate total number of toys produced by the first 4 workers

- 2 workers produce **6 toys/hour**, so together they make:
  $$
  2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ toys/hour}
  $$

- 2 workers produce **4 toys/hour**, so together they make:
  $$
  2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ toys/hour}
  $$

- Total from these 4 workers:
  $$
  12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys/hour}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Multiply by 10 hours (the shift)

$$
20 \text{ toys/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 200 \text{ toys}
$$

So, the 4 workers produced **200 toys** in 10 hours.

---

### Step 3: Total toys needed is 400, but only 200 were made

$$
400 - 200 = 200 \text{ toys still needed}
$$

But we are told that **after the shift**, **20 more toys are still needed**. So the **fifth worker** must have produced:

$$
200 - 20 = 180 \text{ toys}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find how many toys per hour the fifth worker produces

$$
\frac{180 \text{ toys}}{10 \text{ hours}} = 18 \text{ toys/hour}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**The fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.**
We are given:

- Kory’s dog weighs **60 pounds**.
- Elijah has **two dogs**:
  - One is **one-fourth** the weight of Kory’s dog.
  - The other is **half** the weight of Kory’s dog.

---

### Step 1: Find the weight of Elijah’s first dog

One-fourth of Kory’s dog's weight:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the weight of Elijah’s second dog

Half of Kory’s dog's weight:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add up the weights of all the dogs

- Kory’s dog: **60 pounds**
- Elijah’s first dog: **15 pounds**
- Elijah’s second dog: **30 pounds**

$$
60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{105} \text{ pounds}
$$
We are told a series of events involving the distribution of stickers. Let's work **backwards** from the end to find out how many stickers Seth had in the beginning.

---

### Step 1: Understand what we know at the end

- **Kris kept 9 stickers.**
- **Kris gave away 7 stickers to Rob.**

So, **Kris had 9 + 7 = 16 stickers** in total.

---

### Step 2: What did Kris get?

Kris received the **remaining stickers** after Luis used half and gave the rest to Kris.

Let’s call the number of stickers **Luis had before giving any away = L**.

- Luis used half of them: $ \frac{L}{2} $
- So he gave the other half to Kris: $ \frac{L}{2} $

We just found that **Kris had 16 stickers**, so:

$$
\frac{L}{2} = 16 \Rightarrow L = 32
$$

So **Luis had 32 stickers** before giving any away.

---

### Step 3: What did Luis get?

Luis got the **remaining stickers** after Seth gave him half of his stickers.

Let’s call the number of stickers **Seth had at the start = S**.

- Seth gave half of them to Luis: $ \frac{S}{2} $
- So Luis had $ \frac{S}{2} = 32 $

Therefore:

$$
\frac{S}{2} = 32 \Rightarrow S = 64
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total weight of M&Ms**

John buys **3 large bags**, each weighing **10 ounces**.

$$
\text{Total weight} = 3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ ounces}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Total number of M&Ms**

Each **ounce** contains **30 M&Ms**.

$$
\text{Total M&Ms} = 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Number of small bags he can make**

Each **small bag** holds **10 M&Ms**.

$$
\text{Number of small bags} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 90 small bags**.
We are given:

- Alfie the albatross flies **400 kilometers every day**.
- The **circumference of the Earth is 40,000 kilometers**.
- We need to find how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to **half of the way around the Earth**.

---

### Step 1: Find half the circumference of the Earth

$$
\text{Half the circumference} = \frac{40,000}{2} = 20,000 \text{ kilometers}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many days it takes to fly 20,000 km at 400 km/day

$$
\text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000}{400} = 50
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{50} \text{ days}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

We are given:

- The **average car** can go **120 miles per hour**.
- The **second fastest car** is **5 times faster** than the average car.
- The **fastest car** is **1.25 times faster** than the second fastest car.

We need to find how fast the **fastest car** goes.

---

### Step 1: Find the speed of the second fastest car

The second fastest car is **5 times faster** than the average car.

$$
\text{Speed of second fastest car} = 5 \times \text{Average car speed} = 5 \times 120 = 600 \text{ mph}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the speed of the fastest car

The fastest car is **1.25 times faster** than the second fastest car.

$$
\text{Speed of fastest car} = 1.25 \times \text{Speed of second fastest car} = 1.25 \times 600 = 750 \text{ mph}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{750 \text{ miles per hour}}
$$

That’s the speed of the fastest car!
We are given:

- Liam is **16 years old now**.
- **Two years ago**, Liam’s age was **twice** the age of Vince.

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find Liam's age two years ago

Liam is currently 16, so two years ago he was:

$$
16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the information about Vince

Two years ago, Liam’s age (14) was **twice** Vince’s age at that time.

So, let’s call Vince’s age **two years ago** $ x $. Then:

$$
14 = 2x
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
x = \frac{14}{2} = 7
$$

So, **Vince was 7 years old two years ago**.

---

### Step 3: Find Vince’s current age

If Vince was 7 two years ago, then his current age is:

$$
7 + 2 = 9
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{9}
$$

Vince is **9 years old now**.
We are given the following information:

- Total number of eggs painted: **56**
- Arnold and Madeline painted the **same number** of eggs.
- **Camden and Sarah** painted a total of **30 eggs**.
- **Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah**.

We are asked to find: **How many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold?**

---

### Step 1: Let variables represent the unknowns

Let:
- $ A $ = number of eggs Arnold painted
- $ M $ = number of eggs Madeline painted
- $ C $ = number of eggs Camden painted
- $ S $ = number of eggs Sarah painted

From the problem:

1. $ A = M $ (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number)
2. $ C + S = 30 $ (Camden and Sarah painted 30 eggs together)
3. $ C = S + 12 $ (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)
4. $ A + M + C + S = 56 $ (Total eggs painted)

---

### Step 2: Use equations to solve

From equation 2 and 3:

$$
C + S = 30 \\
C = S + 12
$$

Substitute $ C = S + 12 $ into $ C + S = 30 $:

$$
(S + 12) + S = 30 \\
2S + 12 = 30 \\
2S = 18 \\
S = 9
$$

Now find $ C $:

$$
C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21
$$

So:
- $ S = 9 $
- $ C = 21 $

---

### Step 3: Use total to find Arnold and Madeline's eggs

We know:

$$
A + M + C + S = 56 \\
A + M + 21 + 9 = 56 \\
A + M = 56 - 30 = 26
$$

But from earlier, $ A = M $, so:

$$
A + A = 26 \\
2A = 26 \\
A = 13
$$

So:
- $ A = 13 $
- $ M = 13 $

---

### Step 4: Answer the question

We are asked: **How many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold?**

$$
C - A = 21 - 13 = \boxed{8}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **8**
We are given the following information:

- Nik has **200 crayons**.
- Each **crayon weighs 1 ounce**.
- He wants to put them into **groups of 8** and put each group into a **box**.
- Each **box weighs 8 ounces**.
- There are **16 ounces in a pound**.

---

### Step 1: Total weight of crayons

Each crayon is 1 ounce, so:

$$
\text{Total weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
$$

---

### Step 2: How many boxes?

He puts the crayons into **groups of 8**, so:

$$
\text{Number of groups} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \text{ groups}
$$

So he uses **25 boxes**.

---

### Step 3: Total weight of boxes

Each box weighs 8 ounces, so:

$$
\text{Total weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total weight of crayons and boxes

$$
\text{Total weight} = 200 \text{ ounces (crayons)} + 200 \text{ ounces (boxes)} = 400 \text{ ounces}
$$

---

### Step 5: Convert ounces to pounds

There are 16 ounces in a pound:

$$
\text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400 \text{ ounces}}{16 \text{ ounces/pound}} = 25 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{25} \text{ pounds}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much John makes from cutting and selling the tree.

---

### **Step 1: Total length of the tree**
- The tree is **80 feet** tall.

---

### **Step 2: Amount of wood he can get from the tree**
- He can make logs out of **80%** of the tree.
- So, the usable wood =  
  $$
  80 \times 0.8 = 64 \text{ feet}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Cutting the wood into 4-foot logs**
- Each log is **4 feet** long.
- Number of logs =  
  $$
  \frac{64}{4} = 16 \text{ logs}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Cutting each log into planks**
- From each log, he cuts **5 planks**.
- Total number of planks =  
  $$
  16 \text{ logs} \times 5 \text{ planks per log} = 80 \text{ planks}
  $$

---

### **Step 5: Selling the planks**
- Each plank sells for **$1.20**.
- Total revenue =  
  $$
  80 \text{ planks} \times 1.20 = 96 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{96}
$$

John makes **$96** from the tree.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand what is given

- **Valerie earns $5000 per month.**
- **Valerie earns half of what her brother earns.**
- **Their mother earns twice their combined salary.**

We are asked to find:  
**What is the total amount of money they all have together?**

---

### Step 2: Find the brother's salary

Valerie earns **$5000**, and that is **half** of what her brother earns.

Let the brother’s salary be **B**.

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times B = 5000
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
B = 10000
$$

So, the **brother earns $10,000 per month**.

---

### Step 3: Find the combined salary of Valerie and her brother

$$
\text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10000 = 15000
$$

---

### Step 4: Find the mother's salary

The mother earns **twice** their combined salary.

$$
\text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15000 = 30000
$$

---

### Step 5: Find the total amount of money they all have together

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Valerie} + \text{Brother} + \text{Mother}
$$
$$
\text{Total} = 5000 + 10000 + 30000 = 45000
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**$45,000**
We are told:

- Grandma walks **3 miles** every day.
- The trail includes:
  - **2 miles on the beach**
  - **1 mile on the sidewalk**
- On the **sidewalk**, she walks at **twice the speed** as on the **beach**.
- She spends **40 minutes** walking on the **beach**.
- We need to find how long her **entire 3-mile walk** takes.

---

### Step 1: Find Grandma’s walking speed on the beach

She walks **2 miles on the beach** in **40 minutes**.

So, her **speed on the beach** is:

$$
\text{Speed on beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find her speed on the sidewalk

She walks **twice as fast** on the sidewalk:

$$
\text{Speed on sidewalk} = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find time spent on the sidewalk

She walks **1 mile** on the sidewalk at a speed of $ \frac{1}{10} $ miles per minute.

Time = distance ÷ speed:

$$
\text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total time for the entire walk

$$
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 + 10 = \boxed{50} \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **50 minutes**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate how much Jane has already saved

Jane saves **$4 per week** for **8 weeks**:

$$
4 \text{ dollars/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ dollars}
$$

So, she has already saved **$32**.

---

### Step 2: Determine how much more she needs to save

She wants to save a total of **$60**, so the amount she still needs is:

$$
60 - 32 = 28 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate how many more weeks it will take

She saves **$4 per week**, so the number of weeks needed to save **$28** is:

$$
28 \div 4 = 7 \text{ weeks}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

It will take Jane **7 more weeks** to save a total of $60.
Let's break this down step by step.

We are told:

- **3 trees** each had **7 blue birds**.
- **2 different trees** each had **4 blue birds**.
- **1 final tree** had **3 blue birds**.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of blue birds in the first group of trees
- 3 trees × 7 blue birds per tree = **21 blue birds**

### Step 2: Calculate the number of blue birds in the second group of trees
- 2 trees × 4 blue birds per tree = **8 blue birds**

### Step 3: Add the blue birds from the final tree
- 1 tree × 3 blue birds = **3 blue birds**

### Step 4: Add all the blue birds together
- 21 (from first group) + 8 (from second group) + 3 (final tree) = **32 blue birds**

### ✅ Final Answer:
**32 blue birds** in total.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the first condition

> "If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles."

- A **dozen** is 12, so **2 dozen = 24**.
- So, if Bob receives **24 more marbles**, he will have **60 marbles**.

This means that **currently**, before receiving the 24 marbles, Bob has:

$$
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ marbles}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the second condition

> "If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, how many marbles will Bob have?"

We already found that Bob currently has **36 marbles**.

If he **loses 10**, then he will have:

$$
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ marbles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{26}
$$
We are given the following:

- Donny can **only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees**.
- He has **two mugs of water**:
  - One is **33 degrees**.
  - The other is **unknown temperature**, let's call it **T**.
- He pours:
  - **4 ounces** from the **33-degree mug** into a **water bottle**.
  - **1 ounce** from the **other mug (T degrees)** into the same **water bottle**.
- After this, he is **able to drink the water**, meaning the **final temperature of the water in the bottle is at least 40 degrees**.

We are to find the **minimum possible value of T** such that the final temperature of the mixture is **at least 40 degrees**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem

Let’s define:

- Mug A: 33°F, 4 oz poured into the bottle.
- Mug B: T°F, 1 oz poured into the bottle.
- Total volume in the bottle: 4 + 1 = **5 ounces**
- Final temperature of the mixture must be ≥ 40°F.

We need to find the **minimum T** such that the final temperature of the mixture is at least 40°F.

---

### Step 2: Use the formula for weighted average temperature

The final temperature of the mixture is the **weighted average** of the temperatures of the two parts:

$$
\text{Final Temp} = \frac{(4 \times 33) + (1 \times T)}{5}
$$

We want this to be **at least 40**:

$$
\frac{4 \times 33 + T}{5} \geq 40
$$

Multiply both sides by 5:

$$
4 \times 33 + T \geq 200
$$

$$
132 + T \geq 200
$$

$$
T \geq 68
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{68}
$$

So, the **minimum temperature of the second mug** is **68 degrees**.
Let's break this down step by step to find the **total number of animals on the farm after three weeks**.

---

### **Initial Setup:**
- **Starting with:**
  - 50 cows
  - 20 chickens

So, initial total animals =  
$$
50 \text{ cows} + 20 \text{ chickens} = 70 \text{ animals}
$$

---

### **Daily Deliveries for 3 Weeks:**

- **Three weeks = 3 × 7 = 21 days**

- **Cows delivered per day:** 20 cows  
  So, in 21 days:  
  $$
  20 \text{ cows/day} × 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows}
  $$

- **Chickens delivered per day:** 10 chickens  
  So, in 21 days:  
  $$
  10 \text{ chickens/day} × 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens}

  Initial cows + cows delivered =  
  $$
  50 + 420 = 470 \text{ cows}
  $$

- **Total chickens:**  
  Initial chickens + chickens delivered =  
  $$
  20 + 210 = 230 \text{ chickens}
  $$

- **Total animals on the farm:**  
  $$
  470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = \boxed{700} \text{ animals}
  $$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

\boxed{700}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: **Cost of 4 packs without discount**

Each pack costs **$10.00**, and Russell orders **4 packs**.

$$
\text{Total cost before discount} = 4 \times 10 = \$40.00
$$

---

### Step 2: **Apply the 10% discount**

He gets a **10% discount** on the total cost of 4 packs.

$$
\text{Discount} = 10\% \times 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = \$4.00
$$

$$
\text{Discounted total} = 40 - 4 = \$36.00
$$

---

### Step 3: **Total number of bagels**

Each pack has **9 bagels**, and he orders **4 packs**.

$$
\text{Total bagels} = 4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
$$

---

### Step 4: **Cost per bagel**

Now divide the **discounted total cost** by the **total number of bagels** to find the cost per bagel.

$$
\text{Cost per bagel} = \frac{\$36.00}{36} = \$1.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\$1.00}
$$

Each single bagel will cost **\$1.00** after the discount.
We are given a word problem, and we need to find **how many potatoes Gomer ate**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the first sentence

> **"Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes."**

This means:

$$
\text{Number of scoops Gomer ate} = 23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
$$

So, Gomer ate **18 scoops** of mashed potatoes.

---

### Step 2: Understand the second sentence

> **"It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes."**

Let’s break this down:

- "3 less than 6 potatoes" = $6 - 3 = 3$ potatoes
- "1 less than 3 scoops" = $3 - 1 = 2$ scoops

So, the sentence is saying:

> It takes **3 potatoes** to make **2 scoops** of mashed potatoes.

We can write this as a **rate**:

$$
\frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = \frac{3}{2} \text{ potatoes per scoop}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find how many potatoes are in 18 scoops

Now that we know it takes **3 potatoes per 2 scoops**, we can compute how many potatoes are in **18 scoops**.

First, find how many 2-scoop groups are in 18 scoops:

$$
\frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ groups of 2 scoops}
$$

Each group uses **3 potatoes**, so total potatoes:

$$
9 \times 3 = 27 \text{ potatoes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{27}
$$

Gomer ate **27 potatoes**.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many **dozens of eggs** Chester will need for 60 days.

---

### Step 1: Calculate total number of eggs eaten in the first 30 days

Chester eats **3 eggs per day** for **30 days**:

$$
3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate total number of eggs eaten in the next 30 days

Chester increases to **5 eggs per day** for the next **30 days**:

$$
5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add both amounts to get total eggs for 60 days

$$
90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}
$$

---

### Step 4: Convert total eggs to dozens

There are **12 eggs in a dozen**, so:

$$
\frac{240 \text{ eggs}}{12} = 20 \text{ dozen}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Chester will need 20 dozen eggs for 60 days.**
We are given the following information:

- Total number of jellybeans = 60  
- Number of **green** jellybeans = 17  
- Number of **red** jellybeans = **twice** the number of green jellybeans  
- The rest of the jellybeans are **blue**

---

### Step 1: Find the number of red jellybeans

Red jellybeans = 2 × green jellybeans  
= 2 × 17 = **34**

---

### Step 2: Add green and red jellybeans

Green + Red = 17 + 34 = **51**

---

### Step 3: Subtract from total to find blue jellybeans

Total jellybeans = 60  
Blue jellybeans = Total − (Green + Red)  
= 60 − 51 = **9**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **9 blue jellybeans**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of trees**: 5  
2. **Lemons per tree per year**: 6  
3. **Number of years in a decade**: 10  

### Step 1: Lemons from one tree in one year  
Each tree gives 6 lemons per year.

### Step 2: Lemons from all trees in one year  
There are 5 trees, so:  
$$
5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons/year}
$$

### Step 3: Lemons in a decade (10 years)  
$$
30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **300 lemons**.
We are given:

- The **ratio of men to women** on the bus is **5:9**.
- The **total number of passengers** is **84**.
- **20 women** get off the bus at the next stop.
- We need to find how many **women remain** on the bus.

---

### Step 1: Use the ratio to find the number of men and women

The ratio of men to women is **5:9**, which means for every 5 men, there are 9 women.

So, the total parts in the ratio =  
$$
5 + 9 = 14 \text{ parts}
$$

Each part represents:
$$
\frac{84}{14} = 6 \text{ people}
$$

Now calculate the number of women:
$$
9 \text{ parts} \times 6 = 54 \text{ women}
$$

Number of men:
$$
5 \text{ parts} \times 6 = 30 \text{ men}
$$

---

### Step 2: Subtract the number of women who alight

$$
54 - 20 = 34 \text{ women remaining}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{34}
$$

So, **34 women** have remained on the bus.
We are given the following information:

- **Sunflower price**: $2 each  
- **Bouquet price**: $8 each  
- **Earnings from sunflowers per day**: $26  
- **Earnings from bouquets per day**: $56  
- **Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers**  
- We need to find: **Total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days**

---

### Step 1: Find how many bouquets are sold per day

Each bouquet sells for **$8**, and Faraday earns **$56 per day** from bouquets.

$$
\text{Number of bouquets per day} = \frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets/day}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many sunflowers are in bouquets per day

Each bouquet has **12 sunflowers**, so:

$$
\text{Sunflowers from bouquets per day} = 7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers/day}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find how many sunflowers are sold separately (not in bouquets)

Faraday earns **$26 per day** from selling sunflowers individually, at **$2 each**.

$$
\text{Sunflowers sold individually per day} = \frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers/day}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total sunflowers sold per day

$$
\text{Total sunflowers per day} = 84 + 13 = 97 \text{ sunflowers/day}
$$

---

### Step 5: Total sunflowers sold over 3 days

$$
\text{Total sunflowers over 3 days} = 97 \times 3 = 291 \text{ sunflowers}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**291 sunflowers** were sold after 3 days.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much money Adam loses.

---

### **Step 1: How many rocks can Adam buy?**

Adam has **$100** and each rock costs **$5**.

$$
\text{Number of rocks} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks}
$$

So, Adam buys **20 rocks**.

---

### **Step 2: How many rocks does he sell?**

He sells **60%** of his inventory.

$$
\text{Rocks sold} = 0.6 \times 20 = 12 \text{ rocks}
$$

---

### **Step 3: How much money does he make from selling the rocks?**

He sells each rock for **$7**.

$$
\text{Revenue} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 4: How much money did he spend on the rocks?**

He spent **$100** to buy all 20 rocks.

---

### **Step 5: How much money does he lose?**

$$
\text{Loss} = \text{Money spent} - \text{Money earned}
$$

$$
\text{Loss} = 100 - 84 = 16 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Adam loses $16.**
We are given that:

- Lauren can draw **5 large-sized scenes per day**
- She can draw **6 medium-sized scenes per day**
- She can draw **7 small-sized scenes per day**

She needs to create:

- **45 large-sized scenes**
- **36 medium-sized scenes**
- **49 small-sized scenes**

We need to calculate how many **days** it will take her to complete **all** of these scenes.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the number of days required for each type of scene

- **Large scenes**:  
  $ \frac{45}{5} = 9 $ days

- **Medium scenes**:  
  $ \frac{36}{6} = 6 $ days

- **Small scenes**:  
  $ \frac{49}{7} = 7 $ days

---

### Step 2: Determine the **maximum** number of days needed across all types

Since she can only work on **one type of scene per day**, we must consider the **longest time** required for any one type.

So, the total number of days required is:

$$
\boxed{9} \text{ days}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**It will take Lauren 9 days** to complete all the picture scenes.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Start with the initial number of roses:**  
   Patricia has **30 roses**.

2. **She gives 24 roses to her mother:**  
   $ 30 - 24 = 6 $  
   So now she has **6 roses** left.

3. **Then she buys 15 more roses:**  
   $ 6 + 15 = 21 $

### Final Answer:  
Patricia now has **21 roses**.
To find **average speed**, we use the formula:

$$
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
$$

---

### Step 1: Find total distance

- First part: 110 miles  
- Second part: 140 miles  

$$
\text{Total Distance} = 110 + 140 = 250 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find total time

- First part: 2 hours  
- Second part: 3 hours  

$$
\text{Total Time} = 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate average speed

$$
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**50 miles per hour**.
We are given:

- **Ticket 1** has a **20%** chance of winning.
- **Ticket 2** has a **3 times more likely** chance of winning than Ticket 1.

---

### Step 1: Find the probability of winning for Ticket 2

Since Ticket 2 is **three times more likely** to win than Ticket 1, and Ticket 1 has a **20%** chance of winning:

$$
P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 3 \times 20\% = 60\%
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the probability that **both tickets win**

Assuming the two events (Ticket 1 winning and Ticket 2 winning) are **independent**, we multiply their probabilities:

$$
P(\text{Both win}) = P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) \times P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 20\% \times 60\% = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
$$

---

### Step 3: Convert to percentage

$$
0.12 = 12\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**12%**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the variables

Let:
- $ J $ = number of seashells Jim collected
- $ C $ = number of seashells Carlos collected
- $ R $ = number of seashells Carrey collected

We are given:

1. **Jim collected 27 seashells**  
   $$
   J = 27
   $$

2. **Jim collected 5 more than Carlos**  
   $$
   J = C + 5
   $$

3. **Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey**  
   $$
   C = 2R
   $$

---

### Step 2: Use the equations to find values

From (2):  
$$
27 = C + 5 \Rightarrow C = 27 - 5 = 22
$$

From (3):  
$$
C = 2R \Rightarrow 22 = 2R \Rightarrow R = 11
$$

So now we have:
- Jim: 27
- Carlos: 22
- Carrey: 11

---

### Step 3: Total number of seashells

$$
\text{Total} = J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60
$$

---

### Step 4: Divide equally among the three people

$$
\frac{60}{3} = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Each person got **20 seashells**.
Let's break this down step by step.

Mason eats:

- **4 carrots each on weekdays**  
  There are **5 weekdays** (Monday to Friday), so:  
  $ 4 \text{ carrots/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ carrots} $

- **5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday**  
  There are **2 weekend days**, so:  
  $ 5 \text{ carrots/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ carrots} $

Now, add them together:  
$ 20 \text{ (weekdays)} + 10 \text{ (weekend)} = 30 \text{ carrots} $

### ✅ Final Answer: **30 carrots per week**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information

- John buys a **cassette** with **2 songs**.
- The **first song** is **5 minutes** long.
- The **second song** is **60% longer** than the first.

We are asked to find the **total time** of the cassette (i.e., the total length of both songs).

---

### Step 2: Find the length of the second song

The second song is **60% longer** than the first. That means:

$$
\text{Length of second song} = \text{Length of first song} + 60\% \text{ of first song}
$$

$$
= 5 + 0.6 \times 5 = 5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add the lengths of both songs

$$
\text{Total time} = 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{13} \text{ minutes}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the cost and selling price**

- **Cost price (CP) of one mobile device** = $20  
- **Selling price (SP) of one mobile device** = **Twice the original price** = 2 × $20 = **$40**

So, **profit per device** = SP - CP = $40 - $20 = **$20**

---

### **Step 2: Total number of devices sold**

- **Devices bought last Monday** = 2  
- **Devices bought last Tuesday** = 4  
- **Total devices sold** = 2 + 4 = **6**

---

### **Step 3: Total profit**

- **Profit per device** = $20  
- **Total profit** = 6 × $20 = **$120**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Linus earned a total profit of **$120** after selling all the mobile devices.
We are given the following information:

1. **Isabel is 7 feet tall.**
2. **Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel.**
3. **Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned.**
4. **Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall.**

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find Ned's height

Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel.

$$
\text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find Carl's height

Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned.

$$
\text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the length of Carl's cane

Carl's cane is **half as long as he is tall**.

$$
\text{Cane length} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Carl's height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{3} \text{ feet}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**

- Hortex can produce **4200 bottles** of juice **per day**.
- Each bottle covers **20%** of one person’s daily energy demand.
- We want to find out how many **more** bottles Hortex needs to produce in order to cover **100%** of the daily energy needs of **2300 people**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how much energy is needed for 2300 people**

Each person needs **100%** of their daily energy, and each bottle covers **20%** of that.

So, **how many bottles are needed per person to cover 100%?**

$$
\frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \text{ bottles per person}
$$

Therefore, for **2300 people**, the total number of bottles needed is:

$$
2300 \times 5 = 11,500 \text{ bottles}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine how many more bottles are needed**

Hortex currently produces **4200 bottles** per day. To meet the demand of 11,500 bottles, they need:

$$
11,500 - 4200 = 7,300 \text{ more bottles}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{7300}
$$

Hortex would have to produce **7,300 more bottles** per day to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
We are given that Carla gave birth to **identical octuplets**, so there are **8 babies** in total.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many are dressed in purple and how many in blue.

- **3/4 of the babies** are dressed in **purple**:
  $$
  \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ babies in purple}
  $$

- The remaining **1/4** are dressed in **blue**:
  $$
  \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ babies in blue}
  $$

So:
- **Purple**: 6 babies
- **Blue**: 2 babies

---

### Step 2: Determine how many wear bows.

We are told:

- **All the blue-wearers** also wear bows → 2 babies wear bows (since all 2 blue babies wear bows).
- **1/3 of the purple-wearers** also wear bows:
  $$
  \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ purple babies wear bows}
  $$

So total number of babies wearing bows:
$$
2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4 \text{ babies with bows}
$$

---

### Step 3: What is the probability that a baby wearing a bow is wearing **purple**?

Out of the 4 babies wearing bows, **2 are purple**.

So the probability is:
$$
\frac{\text{Purple bow-wearing babies}}{\text{Total bow-wearing babies}} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5
$$

Convert to **percentage**:
$$
0.5 \times 100 = 50\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**50%**
We are given the following information:

- Total number of tax reports received by the IRS last week: **5168**
- Reports received on **Monday and Tuesday**: **1907**
- Reports received on **Thursday and Friday**: **2136**

We are asked to find how many reports were received on **Wednesday**.

---

### Step 1: Add the reports from Monday and Tuesday, and Thursday and Friday

$$
\text{Monday + Tuesday} + \text{Thursday + Friday} = 1907 + 2136 = 4043
$$

---

### Step 2: Subtract this total from the overall weekly total to find Wednesday's reports

$$
\text{Wednesday} = 5168 - 4043 = 1125
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**1125 tax reports were received on Wednesday.**
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much money Abraham will earn from selling all his unused land.

---

### **Step 1: Total Land Area**

Abraham owns **80 square meters** of land.

---

### **Step 2: First Sale – Half of the Land**

He sold **half** of the land:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ square meters}
$$

He sold this for **$50**.

So, he earned **$50** from this sale.

---

### **Step 3: Second Sale – One Fourth of the Land**

He sold **one fourth** of the land:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \text{ square meters}
$$

He sold this for **$30**.

So, he earned **$30** from this sale.

---

### **Step 4: Third Sale – Remaining Land**

We already sold:

- 40 m² (first sale)
- 20 m² (second sale)

Total sold so far:  
$$
40 + 20 = 60 \text{ square meters}
$$

Remaining land:
$$
80 - 60 = 20 \text{ square meters}
$$

He sold the remaining **20 square meters** at **$3 per square meter**:

$$
20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Total Earnings**

Add up all the earnings:

- First sale: $50  
- Second sale: $30  
- Third sale: $60  

$$
50 + 30 + 60 = \boxed{140}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$140**

### Step 1: Total number of eggs hidden
Cole hid **3 dozen eggs**.

- 1 dozen = 12 eggs  
- So, 3 dozen = **3 × 12 = 36 eggs**

---

### Step 2: How many eggs each person found

- **Lamar finds 5 eggs.**
- **Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar:**  
  $ 2 × 5 = 10 $ eggs
- **Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy:**  
  $ 10 - 2 = 8 $ eggs
- **Mei finds half as many as Charlie:**  
  $ \frac{1}{2} × 8 = 4 $ eggs

---

### Step 3: Total number of eggs found

Add up the eggs found by all:

- Lamar: 5  
- Stacy: 10  
- Charlie: 8  
- Mei: 4  

$$
5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs}
$$

---

### Step 4: Eggs still hidden in the yard

Total eggs hidden = 36  
Eggs found = 27  
So, eggs still hidden =  
$$
36 - 27 = 9

### **Step 1: Determine the number of apartments in each complex**

- The **first two complexes** each have **200 apartments**.
  - So, total for the first two = $ 200 + 200 = 400 $ apartments.

- The **third complex** is **60% bigger than the other two combined**.

  To find 60% of 400:
  $$
  0.60 \times 400 = 240
  $$

  So, the third complex has:
  $$
  400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Total number of apartments across all three complexes**

$$
200 + 200 + 640 = 1040 \text{ apartments}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Number of collections per week**

John collects garbage **3 times a week** from **each apartment**.

So, total collections per week:
$$
1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 = 3120 \text{ collections}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Earnings per collection**

He gets paid **$0.40 per collection**.

So, total earnings per week:
$$
3120 \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{1248}
$$

John makes **$1,248** in a week.
We are given information about the number of fruits produced by an avocado tree over 10 years. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s define:

- $ x $ = number of fruits produced by a **5-year-old** avocado tree.
- Then, based on the problem:
  - A **6-year-old** produces **3 times** the initial amount: $ 3x $
  - A **7-year-old** produces **7 times** the initial amount: $ 7x $
  - A **10-year-old** produces **200 fruits more** than an **8-year-old**, and also **20 times** the initial amount (i.e., $ 20x $)
  - A **9-year-old** produces **no fruit**
  - The **8-year-old** is **200 fruits less** than the 10-year-old, so:
    $$
    \text{8-year-old} = 20x - 200
    $$

Now we can write equations to solve for $ x $.

---

### Step 2: Use the 10-year-old data

From the problem:

> "An 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one."

So:
$$
\text{8-year-old} = \text{10-year-old} - 200
$$

But we're also told that the **10-year-old** produces **20 times the initial amount**:
$$
\text{10-year-old} = 20x
$$

So:
$$
\text{8-year-old} = 20x - 200
$$

But from earlier, we also said:
$$
\text{8-year-old} = 20x - 200
$$

This matches — so no contradiction here.

---

### Step 3: Now calculate total fruits over 10 years

We need to find the total number of fruits produced during the **10 years**.

Let’s list the production each year:

| Year | Age | Fruits |
|------|-----|--------|
| 1    | 1   | ?      |
| 2    | 2   | ?      |
| 3    | 3   | ?      |
| 4    | 4   | ?      |
| 5    | 5   | $ x $ |
| 6    | 6   | $ 3x $ |
| 7    | 7   | $ 7x $ |
| 8    | 8   | $ 20x - 200 $ |
| 9    | 9   | 0      |
| 10   | 10  | $ 20x $ |

Wait! But this seems inconsistent with the problem statement. Let me recheck.

The key is:

> "a 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits, a 6-year-old one produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits, a 7-year-old one produces 7 times the initial amount, and an 8-year-old produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one."

So the **initial amount** is **50** (from the 5-year-old), not $ x $. So we should use **50** as the base.

So:

- 5-year-old = 50
- 6-year-old = 3 × 50 = 150
- 7-year-old = 7 × 50 = 350
- 10-year-old = 20 × 50 = 1000
- 8-year-old = 1000 - 200 = 800

Now let’s build the table with these numbers:

| Year | Age | Fruits Produced |
|------|-----|------------------|
| 1    | 1   | 0                |
| 2    | 2   | 0                |
| 3    | 3   | 0                |
| 4    | 4   | 0                |
| 5    | 5   | 50               |
| 6    | 6   | 150              |
| 7    | 7   | 350              |
| 8    | 8   | 800              |
| 9    | 9   | 0                |
| 10   | 10  | 1000             |

---

### Step 4: Add up the total

$$
\text{Total} = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 1000 = 2350
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{2350}
$$

So, the avocado tree produces a total of **2350 fruits** during its 10 years of life.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Jack starts with $100.**

2. **Sophia gives Jack 1/5 of her $100.**

   - First, find 1/5 of $100:
     $$
     \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
     $$

   - So, Sophia gives Jack **$20**.

3. **Add that to what Jack already has:**
   $$
   100 + 20 = 120
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **Jack has $120 now.**
We are given the following information:

1. **The red rope was four times the length of the blue rope.**  
   Let’s define:
   - Length of **blue rope** = $ b $
   - Then, **red rope** = $ 4b $

2. **The blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope.**  
   So, **yellow rope** = $ b + 7 $

3. **The total combined length of all three ropes is 37 cm.**  
   So:  
   $$
   \text{Red} + \text{Blue} + \text{Yellow} = 37
   $$

Now substitute in terms of $ b $:

$$
4b + b + (b + 7) = 37
$$

Simplify:

$$
4b + b + b + 7 = 37 \\
6b + 7 = 37
$$

Subtract 7 from both sides:

$$
6b = 30
$$

Divide by 6:

$$
b = 5
$$

Now find the **length of the red rope**, which is:

$$
4b = 4 \times 5 = 20
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **20 centimeters**.
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how much money each person was given**

- **Ronnie** was given **$5**.
- **Rissa** was given **thrice as much** as Ronnie.

So:

$$
\text{Rissa's money} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 2: After giving money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money**

This means that **Rissa gave away 1/5 of her money** to her sister.

$$
\frac{1}{5} \times 15 = 3 \text{ dollars}
$$

So Rissa gave **$3** to her sister.

---

### **Step 3: Each of them gave the same amount to their sister**

So **Ronnie also gave $3** to his sister.

---

### **Step 4: How much money does Ronnie have left?**

Ronnie started with **$5**, and gave **$3** to his sister.

$$
5 - 3 = 2 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{2}
$$

Ronnie is left with **$2**.
We are told:

- The mural uses **four colors**: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are **equal amounts** of **red, white, and purple** paint.
- **Half the mural is yellow**.
- The **total amount of paint used is 12 pints**.

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ R $ = amount of red paint (in pints)
- $ W $ = amount of white paint
- $ P $ = amount of purple paint
- $ Y $ = amount of yellow paint

From the problem:
- $ R = W = P $ (they are equal)
- $ Y = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{total paint} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 $ pints
- Total paint = $ R + W + P + Y = 12 $

---

### Step 2: Substitute known values

Since $ R = W = P $, let’s call this common value $ x $. Then:

$$
R = W = P = x \\
Y = 6
$$

So total paint is:

$$
x + x + x + 6 = 12 \\
3x + 6 = 12
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

$$
3x = 12 - 6 = 6 \\
x = \frac{6}{3} = 2
$$

---

### Final Answer:

The amount of **red paint used** is:

$$
\boxed{2} \text{ pints}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find the **total area of the house**.

---

### Step 1: Area of one bedroom

Each bedroom is **20 feet by 12 feet**:

$$
\text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet}
$$

---

### Step 2: Area of all 4 bedrooms

Tom has **4 bedrooms**, so:

$$
\text{Total area of all bedrooms} = 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet}
$$

---

### Step 3: Area of the living room

The living room is **5 times bigger** than one bedroom:

$$
\text{Area of living room} = 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet}
$$

---

### Step 4: Area of the rest of the house

We are told that the **rest of the house** (everything else besides the bedrooms and the living room) is **1000 square feet**.

---

### Step 5: Total area of the house

Now, add up all the areas:

- Bedrooms: 960 sq ft  
- Living room: 1200 sq ft  
- Rest of the house: 1000 sq ft  

$$
\text{Total area} = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 \text{ square feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{3160} \text{ square feet}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- **Monday:** Alice counts **3** puffs of clouds.
- **Each subsequent day (Tuesday to Friday):** She sees **double** the number of clouds as the day before.

We need to find the **total number of cloud puffs she counted from Monday through Friday**.

---

### **Step-by-step calculation:**

- **Monday:** 3 puffs  
- **Tuesday:** 2 × 3 = **6** puffs  
- **Wednesday:** 2 × 6 = **12** puffs  
- **Thursday:** 2 × 12 = **24** puffs  
- **Friday:** 2 × 24 = **48** puffs  

---

### **Total for the week:**

$$
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = \boxed{93}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Alice counted a total of **93** puffs of clouds over the five days.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many pods are in the regular box**

- A regular box of 100 dishwasher pods costs $12.
- So, **100 pods = $12**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many pods are in the special box**

- The special box has **20% more pods** than the regular box.
- 20% of 100 is:  
  $$
  0.20 \times 100 = 20
  $$
- So, the special box has:
  $$
  100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods}
  $$

- And it costs the **same price**, $12.

---

### **Step 3: Find out how much one pod costs with the special box**

- The special box has 120 pods for $12.
- So, the cost per pod is:
  $$
  \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: How many cycles can you run for $1?**

- If one pod costs $0.10, then for $1, you can buy:
  $$
  \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ pods}
  $$

- Since you use **1 pod per cycle**, you can run **10 cycles**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{10}
$$

You can run **10 dishwashing cycles** for $1 with the new box.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills**

- Each bill is worth $20.
- So, the number of $20 bills is:

$$
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
$$

---

### **Step 2: He loses 10 bills while getting home**

- Remaining bills:

$$
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
$$

---

### **Step 3: He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill**

- Half of 40 is:

$$
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills used}
$$

- So, remaining bills after paying:

$$
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Thomas triples his money**

- This means he now has **three times** the amount of money he had before this step.

But we need to be careful. The phrase "triples his money" usually refers to tripling the **value**, not the number of bills.

So, what was the value of the remaining bills?

- Each bill is $20, and he has 20 bills left.

$$
20 \times 20 = 400 \text{ dollars}
$$

- Tripling that:

$$
400 \times 3 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
$$

Now, we need to figure out how many **$5 bills** this is equivalent to.

---

### **Step 5: Convert all his money to $5 bills**

- Total value: $1200

- Number of $5 bills:

$$
\frac{1200}{5} = 240 \text{ bills}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{240}
$$

Thomas has **240** five-dollar bills.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **First Half:**

- **Team A scores 4 goals.**
- **Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A.**

So, Team B scores:
$$
4 - 2 = 2 \text{ goals}
$$

---

### **Second Half:**

- **Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half.**

So, Team B scores:
$$
4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ goals}
$$

- **Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half.**

So, Team A scores:
$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ goals}
$$

---

### **Total Goals:**

- **Team A total:** $4 + 2 = 6$
- **Team B total:** $2 + 8 = 10$

So, **total goals scored in the match** is:
$$
6 + 10 = \boxed{16}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **16 goals**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- **Initial length of chalk:** 5 inches
- **Normal usage per day:** 20% of the chalk
- **Recycling happens when the chalk is less than 2 inches**
- **On Monday:**
  - The teacher used **45%** of the chalk (more than usual)
  - So, he used **45% of 5 inches = 2.25 inches**
  - Remaining chalk = 5 - 2.25 = **2.75 inches**

---

### **From Monday onward:**

The teacher now goes back to using only **20% of the chalk each day**, and **recycles when the chalk is less than 2 inches**.

We need to find how many full days he can go before the chalk becomes **less than 2 inches**.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the daily usage (after Monday)**

He uses **20% of the current chalk length each day**.

So, the remaining chalk after each day is:

$$
\text{Remaining} = \text{Current Length} \times (1 - 0.20) = \text{Current Length} \times 0.80
$$

This is a **geometric sequence** where:

- Initial amount (after Monday): 2.75 inches
- Daily multiplier: 0.80
- We want to find the **number of days** until the chalk is **less than 2 inches**

---

### **Step 2: Set up the inequality**

We want to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that:

$$
2.75 \times (0.80)^n < 2
$$

Solve for $ n $:

$$
(0.80)^n < \frac{2}{2.75} = \frac{8}{11} \approx 0.7273
$$

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

$$
\ln((0.80)^n) < \ln(0.7273)
$$

$$
n \cdot \ln(0.80) < \ln(0.7273)
$$

$$
n > \frac{\ln(0.7273)}{\ln(0.80)}
$$

Calculate the values:

- $ \ln(0.7273) \approx -0.318 $
- $ \ln(0.80) \approx -0.223 $

$$
n > \frac{-0.318}{-0.223} \approx 1.426
$$

So, $ n > 1.426 $, meaning **the first full day after Monday** will bring the chalk below 2 inches.

---

### **Step 3: Interpret the result**

- On **Monday**, the chalk was 5 inches, and he used 45%, leaving 2.75 inches.
- On **Tuesday**, he uses 20% of 2.75 → 0.55 inches, so remaining = 2.20 inches
- On **Wednesday**, he uses 20% of 2.20 → 0.44 inches, so remaining = 1.76 inches

Now the chalk is **less than 2 inches**, so he has to recycle.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**He has 2 full days before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.**

- Day 1 (Tuesday): 2.75 → 2.20
- Day 2 (Wednesday): 2.20 → 1.76 (less than 2)

So, **he has 2 full days before recycling**.

---

### 🟩 **Answer: 2 days**
We are given:

- Miss Albert's class has **12 boys** and **12 girls**, so the total number of students is:
  $$
  12 + 12 = 24 \text{ students}
  $$

- **One-third of the girls** are on varsity:
  $$
  \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
  $$

- **One-fourth of the boys** are on varsity:
  $$
  \frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
  $$

So, the total number of students **on varsity** is:
$$
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ students}
$$

Therefore, the number of students **not on varsity** is:
$$
24 - 7 = 17
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **17 students are not on varsity.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

**Step 1:**  
We are told that **Mike bought 5 face masks**.

$$
\text{Mike's masks} = 5
$$

---

**Step 2:**  
We are also told that **Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike**.

So, first, we calculate **thrice as many as Mike**:

$$
3 \times \text{Mike's masks} = 3 \times 5 = 15
$$

Now, add 2 more:

$$
\text{Johnny's masks} = 15 + 2 = 17
$$

---

**Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{17}
$$

Johnny bought **17 face masks**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of teeth**
James has **30 teeth**.

---

### **Step 2: Teeth drilled**
The dentist **drills 4 teeth**.

---

### **Step 3: Teeth capped**
The dentist **caps 7 more teeth than he drills**.

So, the number of teeth capped is:
$$
4 + 7 = 11 \text{ teeth}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total teeth fixed**
Teeth fixed = teeth drilled + teeth capped  
$$
4 + 11 = 15 \text{ teeth}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Percentage of teeth fixed**
To find the percentage of James' teeth that were fixed:
$$
\frac{15}{30} \times 100 = 50\%
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 50%**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total milk purchased**
The company sold **4000 gallons** of milk to Mr. Marcellus' store.

---

### **Step 2: Milk that expired**
Mr. Marcellus realized that **2/5** of the milk had passed its expiry date and could not be sold.

So, the amount of expired milk is:

$$
\frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Refund amount**
Since the expired milk was returned, Mr. Marcellus received a **refund** for the **value of the expired milk**.

The cost per gallon is **$3.5**.

So, the refund amount is:

$$
1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{5600}
$$

Mr. Marcellus received a **refund of $5600**.
We are given a word problem involving ages, and we need to find **how old Colin is now**.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ C $ = Colin's current age
- $ W $ = Wendy's current age

---

### Step 2: Translate the problem into equations

#### First sentence:
> "Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now."

In 7 years, Colin will be $ C + 7 $ years old.  
So, Wendy’s current age is 5 times that:

$$
W = 5(C + 7)
$$

---

#### Second sentence:
> "In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now."

In 25 years, Colin will be $ C + 25 $ years old.  
That is equal to one-third of Wendy’s **current** age:

$$
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve the system of equations

We have two equations:

1. $ W = 5(C + 7) $
2. $ C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W $

Substitute equation (1) into equation (2):

$$
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7))
$$

Simplify the right-hand side:

$$
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
$$

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

$$
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
$$

Distribute:

$$
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
$$

Now solve for $ C $:

$$
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C \\
40 = 2C \\
C = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Colin is currently 20 years old.**
We are given:

- Bob spends **$27,000** distributed among **3 schools**.
- He can buy **100 books for $500**.

We are to find: **How many books can he buy per school?**

---

### Step 1: Find the cost of one book

He can buy **100 books for $500**, so the cost of **one book** is:

$$
\frac{500}{100} = 5 \text{ dollars per book}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many books he can buy with $27,000

If each book costs $5, then the number of books he can buy with $27,000 is:

$$
\frac{27000}{5} = 5400 \text{ books}
$$

---

### Step 3: Distribute the books equally among 3 schools

$$
\frac{5400}{3} = 1800 \text{ books per school}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Bob can buy 1800 books per school.**
Let's break this problem down step by step and track how many apples Newton ends up with at the end.

---

### **Step 1: Two apples fall from the tree.**
- **Apples on the ground:** 2  
- **One lands on Newton’s head.**  
- So, **one apple is on his head**, and **one is on the ground**.

---

### **Step 2: Newton picks up the two apples.**
- He takes **both apples** (the one on his head and the one on the ground).
- **He puts one in his pocket.**
- **He throws the other apple into the tree.**

So far:
- **In pocket:** 1 apple  
- **Thrown into the tree:** 1 apple  
- **On the ground:** 0 apples (since both were picked up)

But throwing the apple into the tree causes **5 more apples to fall out**.

---

### **Step 3: 5 more apples fall out of the tree.**
- Now there are **5 apples on the ground**.
- Newton **picks up these apples**, so he now has:
  - **1 (from before) + 5 = 6 apples**
- He **puts all but one in his pocket**, meaning he keeps **1 apple** and throws **5 apples** into the tree.

So:
- **In pocket:** 1 (original) + 1 (from this round) = **2 apples**
- **Thrown into the tree:** 5 apples  
- **Remaining apples on the ground:** 0

This action also causes **another 6 apples to fall out of the tree**.

- So now he has:
  - **2 apples in his pocket**
  - **+ 6 apples = 8 apples total**

He **goes home to make a pie** with **all the apples he has**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Newton brings **8 apples** home.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many 50 kg bags are needed
Ali ordered **850 kg** of coal, and each bag contains **50 kg**.

$$
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{850}{50} = 17
$$

So, Ali needs **17 bags**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost
Each bag costs **$18**, so:

$$
\text{Total cost} = 17 \times 18 = 306
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The total cost of the order is $306.**
We are given:

- **Cheese pizza** is cut into **12 slices**.
- **Pepperoni pizza** is cut into **8 slices**.
- **Kate’s 6 friends** each eat:
  - **6 cheese slices**
  - **4 pepperoni slices**

We need to find out **how many pizza pies (cheese and pepperoni)** Kate needs to buy.

---

### Step 1: Calculate total cheese slices eaten by friends

Each of the 6 friends eats **6 cheese slices**:

$$
6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ cheese slices per friend} = 36 \text{ cheese slices}
$$

Each cheese pizza has **12 slices**, so we divide:

$$
\frac{36}{12} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate total pepperoni slices eaten by friends

Each of the 6 friends eats **4 pepperoni slices**:

$$
6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ pepperoni slices per friend} = 24 \text{ pepperoni slices}
$$

Each pepperoni pizza has **8 slices**, so we divide:

$$
\frac{24}{8} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total number of pizza pies needed

$$
3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = \boxed{6} \text{ pizza pies}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **6 pizza pies**.
Let's break this down step by step.

We are told:

- **Monday, Wednesday, and Friday**: Sam ran **3 miles** each day.  
  That’s 3 days × 3 miles = **9 miles**.

- **Tuesday and Thursday**: Sam ran **5 miles** each day.  
  That’s 2 days × 5 miles = **10 miles**.

Now, add those together:

- 9 miles (from Monday, Wednesday, Friday)  
- + 10 miles (from Tuesday and Thursday)  
= **19 miles**

### ✅ Final Answer: **19 miles**.
We are given:

- Jay can build **20 snowballs per hour**.
- **2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes**.
- We want to know how long it will take for Jay to have **60 snowballs**.

---

### Step 1: Convert all rates to the same time unit

Let’s convert everything to **per minute**, since the melting rate is given in **15-minute intervals**.

- Jay builds **20 snowballs per hour**  
  → That's **20 / 60 = 1/3 snowball per minute**

- 2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes  
  → That's **2 / 15 ≈ 0.1333 snowballs per minute**

So, the **net rate of snowball accumulation** is:

$$
\frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ snowballs per minute}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how long to get 60 snowballs

If Jay is gaining **1/5 of a snowball per minute**, then to get **60 snowballs**, we need:

$$
\frac{60}{1/5} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{300 \text{ minutes}} \quad \text{or} \quad \boxed{5 \text{ hours}}
$$

So, it will take **5 hours** for Jay to accumulate 60 snowballs.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### **Given:**
- Digimon had its **20th anniversary**.
- When **Digimon came out**, **John was twice as old as Jim**.
- **John is now 28 years old.**
- We are to find **Jim's current age**.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many years have passed since Digimon came out.**

We don't know the exact year Digimon came out, but we **do know that it's now its 20th anniversary**, so:

- **20 years have passed** since Digimon first came out.

---

### **Step 2: Let’s define variables.**

Let:
- $ J $ = John's age when Digimon came out
- $ K $ = Jim's age when Digimon came out

From the problem:
- At that time, **John was twice as old as Jim**:  
  $$
  J = 2K
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Find John's age at that time.**

Now, John is **28 years old**. Since **20 years have passed**, his age at the time of Digimon's release was:

$$
J = 28 - 20 = 8
$$

---

### **Step 4: Use the relationship between John and Jim's ages then.**

We found that:
- $ J = 8 $
- And $ J = 2K $

So:
$$
2K = 8 \Rightarrow K = 4
$$

So, **Jim was 4 years old** when Digimon came out.

---

### **Step 5: Find Jim's current age.**

Since **20 years have passed**, Jim is now:

$$
4 + 20 = 24
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{24}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

We are told:

- Doxa sliced an **apple into 8 pieces**.
- She **ate 1 slice**.
- Her **sister ate 1 more than her**.
- Her **brother ate 1 more than her sister**.

Let’s define the number of slices each person ate:

- Doxa: 1 slice
- Sister: 1 more than Doxa → 1 + 1 = **2 slices**
- Brother: 1 more than sister → 2 + 1 = **3 slices**

Now, let’s add them up:

- Doxa: 1  
- Sister: 2  
- Brother: 3  

Total slices eaten = 1 + 2 + 3 = **6 slices**

So, they all ate **6 slices** of apple.
We are given the following information about a nurses’ station using bandages:

- Bandages come in **bulk packs of 50**.
- On the **first day**, they used **38 bandages** and ordered **1 bulk pack** (so 50 more).
- On the **second day**, they used **10 fewer bandages** than the first day → 38 - 10 = **28 bandages**.
- On the **third day**, they **ordered 2 bulk packs** (so 100 bandages), but only used **half a pack** → 25 bandages.
- At the end of the third day, they had **78 bandages left**.

We are to find how many bandages they **started with on the first day**.

---

### Step 1: Determine total number of bandages used over the three days

Let’s calculate how many bandages were used each day:

- **Day 1**: Used 38 bandages
- **Day 2**: Used 28 bandages
- **Day 3**: Used 25 bandages

**Total used = 38 + 28 + 25 = 91 bandages**

---

### Step 2: Determine total number of bandages ordered

- Day 1: 1 bulk pack = 50 bandages  
- Day 2: No mention of ordering, so assume no additional orders  
- Day 3: 2 bulk packs = 100 bandages  

**Total ordered = 50 + 100 = 150 bandages**

---

### Step 3: Total bandages at the end

They had **78 bandages left** at the end.

So, the **total number of bandages they started with** is:

$$
\text{Starting bandages} = \text{Total ordered} + \text{Bandages left}
$$

$$
\text{Starting bandages} = 150 + 78 = \boxed{228}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **228 bandages**.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given:
- **Hair color cost**: $40
- **Haircut cost**: $30 per inch
- **Initial hair length**: 10 inches
- **Final hair length**: 8 inches

### Step 1: Find out how much hair was cut
$$
\text{Hair cut length} = \text{Initial length} - \text{Final length} = 10 - 8 = 2 \text{ inches}
$$

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the haircut
$$
\text{Haircut cost} = 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60
$$

### Step 3: Add the cost of the color
$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{Haircut cost} + \text{Color cost} = \$60 + \$40 = \$100
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The total cost of her cut and color is $100.**

1. **Blood in one whale**:  
   Brady learned that each **whale** has **40 gallons** of blood.

2. **Blood in one shark**:  
   A **shark** has **three times as much blood** as a whale.  
   So, blood in one shark = $ 3 \times 40 = 120 $ gallons.

3. **Blood in ten sharks**:  
   If one shark has 120 gallons, then ten sharks have:  
   $ 10 \times 120 = 1200 $ gallons.

Let's break down the problem step by step and calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant on that day.

---

### Step 1: First group (morning)
- **50 people** entered the restaurant in the morning.

---

### Step 2: Second group (around 10:00)
- **40 more people** entered the restaurant and ordered the same amount of food as the first group.
- So, **40 people** entered at this time.

---

### Step 3: Third group (after a while)
- "Twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in and ordered lunch."
- Number who entered at 10:00 = **40**
- So, **2 × 40 = 80 people** entered at this time.

---

### Step 4: Fourth group (by evening)
- "An additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant."
- Number that came in first = **50**
- So, **3 × 50 = 150 people** entered by evening.

---

### Step 5: Total number of people
Now, let's add up all the groups:

- Morning: **50**
- Around 10:00: **40**
- After a while (lunch): **80**
- By evening: **150**

$$
\text{Total} = 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = \boxed{320}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{320}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the number of red pen packs
Alain's mom bought **5 packs of red pens**.

---

### Step 2: Determine the number of black pen packs
She bought **twice the amount of black pens as red pens**.  
So, the number of black pen packs is:

$$
2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ packs of black pens}
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine how many pens are in each pack
Each pack has **5 pens**.

---

### Step 4: Calculate total number of red pens
$$
5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ red pens}
$$

---

### Step 5: Calculate total number of black pens
$$
10 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 50 \text{ black pens}
$$

---

### Step 6: Add red and black pens together
$$
25 + 50 = 75 \text{ pens}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Alain has 75 pens.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Cost of Scotch

- John buys **10 bottles** of scotch.
- Total cost for scotch = **$600**.

So, the **price per bottle of scotch** is:

$$
\frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle}
$$

---

### Step 2: Cognac Details

- He buys **twice as many bottles of cognac** as scotch.
- That means he buys:  
  $$
  2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
  $$

- Each bottle of **cognac costs 50% more** than a bottle of scotch.
- Since scotch is $60 per bottle, then:

$$
\text{Cognac price per bottle} = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total Cost of Cognac

$$
20 \text{ bottles} \times 90 \text{ dollars/bottle} = 1800 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total Cost of Everything

$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of scotch} + \text{Cost of cognac} = 600 + 1800 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{2400}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Day 1:**

- Mr. Julius planted **20 White Oak** trees.
- He planted **twice as many Lodgepole Pine** as White Oak.

So, Lodgepole Pine on Day 1 =  
$$
2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ trees}
$$

Total trees on Day 1 =  
$$
20 \text{ (White Oak)} + 40 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 60 \text{ trees}
$$

---

### **Day 2:**

- He planted **10 more White Oak** trees than on Day 1:  
$$
20 + 10 = 30 \text{ White Oak}
$$

- He planted **1/4 more Lodgepole Pine** than on Day 1.

First, find 1/4 of Day 1 Lodgepole Pine:  
$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
$$

So, Lodgepole Pine on Day 2 =  
$$
40 + 10 = 50 \text{ trees}
$$

Total trees on Day 2 =  
$$
30 \text{ (White Oak)} + 50 \text{ (Lodgepole Pine)} = 80 \text{ trees}
$$

---

### **Total Trees Planted Over Two Days:**

$$
60 \text{ (Day 1)} + 80 \text{ (Day 2)} = \boxed{140} \text{ trees}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **140 trees**
Let's go step by step to figure out how much root beer was available for each person at the party.

---

### **Day 1:**
- Fred makes **24 gallons** of root beer and puts them in the cooler.

---

### **Day 2:**
- **Children drink 4 gallons.**
- Remaining root beer:  
  $ 24 - 4 = 20 $ gallons

- **Wife spills 7 gallons.**
- Remaining root beer:  
  $ 20 - 7 = 13 $ gallons

---

### **Day 3:**
- **Friend Ronnie takes 5 gallons.**
- Remaining root beer:  
  $ 13 - 5 = 8 $ gallons

---

### **Day 4:**
- **3 people show up for the party.**
- Fred and the others **share the remaining root beer equally.**

So, **how many people are sharing?**

- Fred + 3 people = **4 people**

---

### **How much is available for each person?**

- Total root beer left: **8 gallons**
- Shared among **4 people**:
  
$$
\frac{8}{4} = 2 \text{ gallons per person}
$$

---

### ✅ **Answer:**
Each person at the party could drink **2 gallons** of root beer.
We are given the equation:

> **Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40.**

Let’s define the variable:

- Let $ x $ be the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.

Now, translate the sentence into an equation:

- "Four times the number of coffee mugs" = $ 4x $
- "Eight more than that" = $ 4x + 8 $

So the equation is:

$$
4x + 8 = 40
$$

### Step 1: Subtract 8 from both sides
$$
4x = 40 - 8 \\
4x = 32
$$

### Step 2: Divide both sides by 4
$$
x = \frac{32}{4} \\
x = 8
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
There are **8** coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.
We are given:

- Total number of fish = **66**
- One-third of the fish have **red stripes**.
- Of the **remaining** fish (after removing those with red stripes), **5/11** have **blue stripes**.

We need to find how many fish have **both red and blue stripes**.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of fish with red stripes

One-third of the total fish have red stripes:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
$$

So, **22 fish have red stripes**.

---

### Step 2: Find the number of remaining fish

Total fish = 66  
Fish with red stripes = 22  
Remaining fish = $66 - 22 = 44$

---

### Step 3: Find the number of fish with blue stripes (from the remaining)

5/11 of the remaining 44 fish have blue stripes:

$$
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
$$

So, **20 fish have blue stripes**.

---

### Step 4: Are any fish counted in both red and blue stripe groups?

The question is asking for the **total number of fish that have red stripes AND blue stripes**. However, from the problem description, it seems that **each fish is only counted once**, either in red stripes, blue stripes, or neither.

But we are told:

- One-third have **red stripes** → 22 fish
- Then, of the **remaining** (i.e., not red), 5/11 have **blue stripes** → 20 fish

So, these two groups (red and blue) are **distinct** — no overlap.

Therefore, the total number of fish with **either red or blue stripes** is:

$$
22 + 20 = 42
$$

And the number of fish with **both red and blue stripes** is:

$$
\boxed{0}
$$

Because the blue stripes are only among the **remaining** (non-red) fish.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{0}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial number of eyeshadow colors**

- Amy has **2 eyeshadow palettes**, each with **4 colors**:
  $$
  2 \text{ palettes} \times 4 \text{ colors per palette} = 8 \text{ colors}
  $$

- She also has **3 makeup sets**, each with **6 eyeshadow colors**:
  $$
  3 \text{ sets} \times 6 \text{ colors per set} = 18 \text{ colors}
  $$

So, total eyeshadow colors she starts with:
$$
8 + 18 = 26 \text{ colors}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Sister steals one palette**

- One palette is stolen, which has **4 colors**:
  $$
  26 - 4 = 22 \text{ colors left}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Amy uses up half of the colors from one makeup set**

- Each makeup set has **6 colors**.
- Half of that is:
  $$
  \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ colors used}
  $$

So, subtract those 3 colors:
$$
22 - 3 = 19 \text{ colors left}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{19}
$$

Amy has **19 eyeshadow colors** left.
We are given the following information:

- **Mattison's height** = 60 inches  
- **House is 7 times as high as Mattison** → Total height of the house = $ 7 \times 60 = 420 $ inches  
- **First-floor ceiling is thrice as high as Mattison** → First-floor ceiling height = $ 3 \times 60 = 180 $ inches  

We are asked to find: **How high is the roof from the second floor's floor?**

---

### Step-by-step:

1. **Total height of the house** = 420 inches  
2. **First-floor ceiling height** = 180 inches  
   - This means that from the ground (first floor floor) to the first-floor ceiling is 180 inches.
3. The **second floor's floor** is directly above the first-floor ceiling, so the height from the **first-floor ceiling to the second-floor floor** is **0 inches** (they are on the same level).
4. Now, we need the **height from the second-floor floor to the roof**.

So, subtract the height of the first floor (180 inches) from the total height of the house:

$$
\text{Height from second floor to roof} = 420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{240} \text{ inches}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- Total number of shells found = **700**
- Team **Alphas** found **40%** of the shells.
- Team **The finders** found **60%** of the **remaining** shells after Alphas.
- We are to find how many shells **Team Gogetters** found.

---

### **Step 1: Find how many shells Alphas found.**

Alphas found **40%** of 700:

$$
\text{Alphas} = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \text{ shells}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find how many shells were left after Alphas.**

$$
\text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \text{ shells}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find how many shells The finders found.**

The finders found **60%** of the remaining 420 shells:

$$
\text{The finders} = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \text{ shells}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Find how many shells Gogetters found.**

Now subtract what Alphas and The finders found from the total:

$$
\text{Gogetters} = 700 - (280 + 252) = 700 - 532 = 168 \text{ shells}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{168}
$$

Team Gogetters found **168 shells**.
We are told that Bernie has **4 dogs**, and each needs a certain amount of exercise per day, specifically in terms of walking miles.

We are given:

- Dog 1: 1 mile  
- Dog 2: 4 miles  
- Dog 3: 3 miles  
- Dog 4: ? miles (this is what we need to find)  
- The **average** number of miles the dogs need to walk per day is **3 miles**.

---

### Step 1: Use the formula for average

The average is calculated as:

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}}
$$

We know:
- Average = 3 miles  
- Number of dogs = 4  
- Sum of known values = 1 + 4 + 3 = **8 miles**

Let the unknown value (for the 4th dog) be $ x $.

So:

$$
3 = \frac{8 + x}{4}
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

Multiply both sides by 4:

$$
3 \times 4 = 8 + x \\
12 = 8 + x
$$

Subtract 8 from both sides:

$$
x = 12 - 8 = 4
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

The last dog needs to walk **4 miles**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Value of the house**: $250,000  
2. **Loan amount (40% of the house value)**:  
   $$
   0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
   $$  
   So, John gets a loan of **$100,000**.

3. **He uses 60% of that loan to pay off his debts**:  
   $$
   0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
   $$  
   So, he pays **$60,000** toward his debts.

4. **Money leftover after paying debts**:  
   $$
   100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$40,000** is the amount John has left after paying off his debts.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Find the total weight of the tunas
Deandre caught **3 tunas**, with the following weights:
- First tuna: **56 kg**
- Second tuna: **46 kg**
- Third tuna: **26 kg**

Add them up:

$$
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kg}
$$

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings
Each kilogram of tuna sells for **$0.50**.

So, the total earnings are:

$$
128 \text{ kg} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/kg} = 64 \text{ dollars}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### **Given:**

- Trinity **bought** the magazines for **$72**.
- She **sells** them at **11/8 of the price she bought them**.

---

### **Step 1: Find the selling price.**

She sells the magazines at **11/8 of the buying price**.

$$
\text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
$$

First, calculate:

$$
\frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8} = \frac{792}{8} = 99
$$

So, she sells the magazines for **$99**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate her profit.**

Profit is calculated as:

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}
$$

$$
\text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{27}
$$

Trinity makes a **profit of $27**.
We are given the following information:

- **Low setting:** Removes **1 liter per day**.
- **Medium setting:** Removes **twice as much as low**, so **2 liters per day**.
- **High setting:** Removes **twice as much as medium**, so **4 liters per day**.

Brian used the dehumidifier for different durations on each setting:

- **3 days on low**
- **3 days on medium**
- **5 days on high**

---

### Step 1: Calculate water removed on each setting

- **Low setting:**  
  $ 3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ liter/day} = 3 \text{ liters} $

- **Medium setting:**  
  $ 3 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ liters/day} = 6 \text{ liters} $

- **High setting:**  
  $ 5 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ liters/day} = 20 \text{ liters} $

---

### Step 2: Add up the total amount of water removed

$$
3 + 6 + 20 = \boxed{29} \text{ liters}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **29 liters**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total number of balloons:**
   - They have 10 packs of balloons.
   - Each pack has 30 balloons.
   - So, total balloons = $10 \times 30 = 300$ balloons.

2. **Balloons left at the end:**
   - By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons are left.

3. **Balloons thrown:**
   - To find how many were thrown, subtract the balloons left from the total:
   $$
   300 - 12 = 288
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **288 balloons** were thrown.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the dosage for **one** medical dose
- Saanvi needs **14 mL** of the **first medicine**.
- She also needs **3 times that amount** of the **second medicine**.

So, for the second medicine:
$$
3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ mL}
$$

### Step 2: Total amount of medicine per dose
$$
14 \text{ mL (first medicine)} + 42 \text{ mL (second medicine)} = 56 \text{ mL per dose}
$$

### Step 3: Find the total for **8 doses**
$$
56 \text{ mL/dose} \times 8 \text{ doses} = 448 \text{ mL}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{448} \text{ mL}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the capacity of Ali’s class

We are told:

- Ali’s class has a **capacity of 120 students**.

So:
$$
\text{Ali's class capacity} = 120 \text{ students}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine the capacity of John’s classes

We are told:

- Each of John’s classes has **1/8 the capacity** of Ali’s class.
- John has **two classes**.

So, first, calculate the capacity of one of John’s classes:

$$
\text{Capacity of one of John's classes} = \frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students}
$$

Now, since John has **two classes**, the total capacity for both of his classes is:

$$
\text{Total capacity of John's classes} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the combined capacity of both schools

- Ali’s school has **one class** with a capacity of **120 students**.
- John’s school has **two classes**, each with a capacity of **15 students**, so total of **30 students**.

Therefore, the **combined capacity** of both schools is:

$$
120 + 30 = \boxed{150} \text{ students}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{150}
$$
We are given the following:

- **Principal amount (P):** $300  
- **Interest rate:** 2% per year  
- **Time period:** 11 months with monthly payments of $25, and the remaining amount (including interest) is paid in the **twelfth month**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total interest for 11 months

The interest is **2% per year**, so we need to find the interest for **11 months**.

$$
\text{Annual interest} = 2\% \times 300 = 0.02 \times 300 = 6
$$

$$
\text{Monthly interest} = \frac{6}{12} = 0.5
$$

$$
\text{Interest for 11 months} = 0.5 \times 11 = 5.5
$$

So, the **total amount to be repaid** is:

$$
\text{Total repayment} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 300 + 5.5 = 305.5
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount paid in the first 11 months

Stephen pays **$25 per month** for 11 months:

$$
\text{Total paid in first 11 months} = 25 \times 11 = 275
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the amount due in the twelfth month

$$
\text{Amount due in twelfth month} = \text{Total repayment} - \text{Total paid in first 11 months}
$$

$$
= 305.5 - 275 = 30.5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Stephen will pay $30.50 in the twelfth month.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Total number of diaper changes per day
- Jordan has **2 children**.
- Each child requires **5 diaper changes per day**.
  
So, total diaper changes per day =  
$$
2 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ changes per child} = 10 \text{ diaper changes}
$$

### Step 2: How many diapers does Jordan's wife change?
- Jordan's wife changes **half** of the diapers.
- Half of 10 is:
$$
\frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ diapers}
$$

### Step 3: How many diapers does Jordan change?
- Total diaper changes = 10
- Wife changes 5
- So Jordan changes:
$$
10 - 5 = 5 \text{ diapers}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.**
We are given the following:

- **Jar dimensions**: 6 inches by 6 inches (square base), 15 inches tall.
- **Jelly bean volume**: 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean.
- **Packing efficiency**: 80%.
- **Red jelly beans**: 30% of total jelly beans.
- **True number of red jelly beans**: 900.

We are to find how far off Tim's guess was, i.e., the absolute difference between his estimate and the true number of red jelly beans (which is 900).

---

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of the jar

The jar is a rectangular prism with square base:

$$
\text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total volume occupied by jelly beans

Since the packing efficiency is 80%, only 80% of the jar's volume is filled with jelly beans:

$$
\text{Volume of jelly beans} = 0.8 \times 540 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans

Each jelly bean has a volume of 0.15 cubic inches, so:

$$
\text{Total jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880
$$

---

### Step 4: Estimate the number of red jelly beans

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red:

$$
\text{Estimated red jelly beans} = 0.3 \times 2880 = 864
$$

---

### Step 5: Find how far off Tim's guess was

The true number of red jelly beans is 900.

$$
\text{Difference} = |900 - 864| = 36
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Tim was 36 jelly beans off.**
Let's go through the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial number of passengers**
- The bus has a **capacity of 200 people**.
- When it departs **Chengli city**, it has **20 people** on board.

---

### **Step 2: First stop**
- **40 people enter** the bus at the first stop.
- So, after the first stop:
  $$
  \text{Passengers} = 20 + 40 = 60
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Second stop**
- At the second station, **3/4 of the people who entered at the first stop** get on the bus.
- That is:
  $$
  \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \text{ people}
  $$
- So, after the second stop:
  $$
  \text{Passengers} = 60 + 30 = 90
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Third stop**
- At the third station, the **number of passengers doubles**.
- So:
  $$
  \text{Passengers} = 90 \times 2 = 180
  $$

---

### **Step 5: Calculate remaining capacity**
- Bus capacity = **200**
- Current passengers = **180**
- Remaining spaces = 
  $$
  200 - 180 = 20
  $$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{20}
$$

So, **20 people** are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Information**

- Pauline visits the museum **3 times a year**.
- The **cost of one visit is $2**.
- After **5 years**, the cost of one visit has **increased by 150%**.
- Pauline **continues to visit** for **3 more years** (so total of 8 years).
- We need to find the **total cost** of all visits over the **8 years**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the Cost of One Visit After 5 Years**

The cost of one visit increases by **150%** after 5 years.

- A 150% increase means the new cost is:
  $$
  \text{New cost} = \text{Original cost} + 150\% \times \text{Original cost}
  $$
  $$
  = 2 + 1.5 \times 2 = 2 + 3 = 5
  $$

So, after 5 years, each visit costs **$5**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate Total Visits and Costs**

- For the **first 5 years**, the cost per visit is **$2**.
- For the **next 3 years**, the cost per visit is **$5**.

#### **Visits in first 5 years:**
$$
5 \text{ years} \times 3 \text{ visits/year} = 15 \text{ visits}
$$
$$
\text{Cost for first 5 years} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars}
$$

#### **Visits in next 3 years:**
$$
3 \text{ years} \times 3 \text{ visits/year} = 9 \text{ visits}
$$
$$
\text{Cost for next 3 years} = 9 \times 5 = 45 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total Cost**

$$
\text{Total cost} = 30 + 45 = \boxed{75}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{75}
$$

Pauline spent **$75** on all visits to the museum over the 8 years.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the problem**

- There are **4 grades** (4th to 7th).
- In **each grade**, the **10 students** with the most Accelerated Reader points get to try the escape room.
- Only **8 students can try the escape room at a time**.
- Each group uses their full **45 minutes**.
- We need to find out how long it will take for **all students** to try the escape room.

---

### **Step 2: Total number of students who qualify**

There are 4 grades, and in each grade, 10 students qualify:

$$
4 \text{ grades} \times 10 \text{ students per grade} = 40 \text{ students}
$$

So, **40 students** in total need to try the escape room.

---

### **Step 3: How many groups can be formed at once?**

Only **8 students** can try the escape room at a time.

$$
\frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students per group}} = 5 \text{ groups}
$$

So, **5 groups** of 8 students each are needed to accommodate all 40 students.

---

### **Step 4: Time required for all groups**

Each group takes **45 minutes**.

$$
5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes per group} = 225 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{225 \text{ minutes}}
$$

Or, in hours and minutes:

$$
225 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours and } 45 \text{ minutes}
$$

So, it will take **3 hours and 45 minutes** for everyone to try the escape room.

- Each table costs **$20**.
- Total cost for tables = $ 4 \times 20 = 80 $ dollars.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the roof frames
- John made **2 roof frames**.
- Each frame costs **$10**.
- Total cost for roof frames = $ 2 \times 10 = 20 $ dollars.

### Step 3: Add the two amounts together
- Total amount Ali has to pay John = $ 80 + 20 = 100 $ dollars.

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Ali has to pay John $100.**
We are told that Ian has a board that is **40 feet long**, and he cuts it into **two pieces** such that the **longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece**.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let the **shorter piece** be $ x $ feet long.

Then the **longer piece** is $ 4x $ feet long (since it's 4 times longer).

---

### Step 2: Set up the equation

The total length of the board is:

$$
x + 4x = 40
$$

$$
5x = 40
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = \frac{40}{5} = 8
$$

So the **shorter piece** is 8 feet, and the **longer piece** is:

$$
4x = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

The **longer piece** is **32 feet** long.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many pounds of meat are needed to make 80 meatballs**

- Aiden makes **16 meatballs per pound** of ground beef.
- He wants to make **80 meatballs**.

So, the number of pounds of meat needed is:

$$
\frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs per pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how much seasoning is needed**

- Aiden uses **2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound of meat**.
- He is using **5 pounds** of meat.

So, the total amount of seasoning needed is:

$$
5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons per pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Aiden will need **10 tablespoons** of his secret steakhouse seasoning.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of windows**: 5  
2. **Width of each window**: 35 inches  
3. **Total width of all windows**:  
   $$
   5 \times 35 = 175 \text{ inches}
   $$

4. **Fabric needed**: Luke needs to buy fabric equal to **2 times** the total width of the windows:  
   $$
   2 \times 175 = 350 \text{ inches}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
Luke should buy **350 inches** of fabric.
We are given the following information:

- The cost of a call is **$0.25 per minute** for the first **16 minutes**.
- After that, the cost drops to **$0.20 per minute**.
- We need to find the total cost of a **36-minute call**.

---

### Step 1: Break down the call into two parts

- For the first **16 minutes**, the cost is **$0.25 per minute**.
- For the remaining **(36 - 16) = 20 minutes**, the cost is **$0.20 per minute**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for each part

- Cost for the first 16 minutes:
  $$
  16 \text{ minutes} \times 0.25 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
  $$

- Cost for the next 20 minutes:
  $$
  20 \text{ minutes} \times 0.20 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Add the two amounts together

$$
4.00 + 4.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
A 36-minute call would cost **$8.00**.
Let's break this down step by step.

We are told:

- It rained **2 inches** on **Monday**.
- On **Tuesday**, it is expected to rain **1 more inch than twice** of Monday’s total.

---

### Step 1: Find twice Monday’s rain
Monday’s rain = 2 inches  
Twice that = $ 2 \times 2 = 4 $ inches

---

### Step 2: Add 1 more inch to that amount
So, Tuesday’s rain = $ 4 + 1 = 5 $ inches

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**5 inches** of rain are expected on Tuesday.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ c $ = number of **cupcakes**
- $ b $ = number of **brownies**

We are told:

> "She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes."

This translates to the equation:

$$
b = 3c - 2
$$

---

### Step 2: Total number of treats

Carly's class has **5 people**, and each person gets **2 treats**.

So total number of treats is:

$$
5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ treats}
$$

That means:

$$
c + b = 10
$$

---

### Step 3: Substitute the expression for $ b $

From earlier, we have:

$$
b = 3c - 2
$$

Substitute into the total treats equation:

$$
c + (3c - 2) = 10
$$

Simplify:

$$
4c - 2 = 10
$$

Add 2 to both sides:

$$
4c = 12
$$

Divide both sides by 4:

$$
c = 3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Carly made **3 cupcakes**.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Cost of Basic Manicure and Pedicure**

- **Basic manicure**: $35  
- **Basic pedicure**: $40  

If Karen gets both, the **total without discount** is:

$$
35 + 40 = 75 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Apply 20% Discount for Both Services**

The salon offers a **20% discount** if you get **both** a manicure and a pedicure.

So, the **discounted total** is:

$$
75 \times (1 - 0.20) = 75 \times 0.80 = 60 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add Nail Art**

Karen wants **nail art on each of her fingers**, which costs **$3 per nail**.

Assuming she has **10 fingers** (5 on each hand), that’s:

$$
10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total Cost**

Now, add the discounted services and the nail art:

$$
60 + 30 = \boxed{90} \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$90**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand what is being asked

We are told:

- Susan orders **3 magazines** that send **12 issues a year**.
- She has **1 magazine** that sends **6 issues a year**.
- Her **last magazine** sends her **4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine**.

We are asked: **How many magazines does she get every year?**

Wait — this wording is a bit confusing. Let’s clarify.

Actually, the question is likely asking:

> **How many issues does Susan receive every year?**

Because the phrase “how many magazines does she get every year” doesn't make much sense in this context — it would just be 4 (the number of magazines she has), but that seems too simple.

So we’ll assume the question is:

> **How many issues does Susan receive every year?**

---

### Step 2: Break down the information

- 3 magazines that send **12 issues/year**:  
  $ 3 \times 12 = 36 $ issues

- 1 magazine that sends **6 issues/year**:  
  $ 1 \times 6 = 6 $ issues

- 1 magazine that sends **4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine**:  
  $ 4 \times 6 = 24 $ issues

---

### Step 3: Add up all the issues

$$
36 + 6 + 24 = 66
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Susan receives 66 issues every year.**
We are given the following information:

- Samantha has **12 fewer paintings** than Shelley.
- Shelley has **8 more paintings** than Kim.
- Samantha has **27 paintings**.

We need to find out how many paintings **Kim** has.

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ S $ = number of paintings Samantha has
- $ Sh $ = number of paintings Shelley has
- $ K $ = number of paintings Kim has

We are told:
- $ S = 27 $
- $ S = Sh - 12 $ → This means Shelley has 12 more paintings than Samantha
- $ Sh = K + 8 $ → Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim

---

### Step 2: Use the first equation to find Shelley's count

From $ S = Sh - 12 $, and $ S = 27 $:

$$
27 = Sh - 12 \Rightarrow Sh = 27 + 12 = 39
$$

So Shelley has **39 paintings**.

---

### Step 3: Use Shelley’s count to find Kim’s count

From $ Sh = K + 8 $, and $ Sh = 39 $:

$$
39 = K + 8 \Rightarrow K = 39 - 8 = 31
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Kim has 31 paintings.**
Let's calculate the price of the toy step by step.

---

### **Step 1: November Price**
The original price in **November** is:

$$
\$40
$$

---

### **Step 2: December Price Increase (80%)**
In **December**, the price increased by **80%**. To find the new price:

$$
\text{Increase} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32
$$
$$
\text{New Price} = 40 + 32 = 72
$$

So, the price in **December** is:

$$
\$72
$$

---

### **Step 3: January Price Decrease (50%)**
In **January**, the price decreased by **50%**. To find the new price:

$$
\text{Decrease} = 72 \times 0.50 = 36
$$
$$
\text{New Price} = 72 - 36 = 36
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{36}
$$

The price of the toy after the discount in January was **\$36**.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the standard rate and the reduced rate

- **Standard rate per hour:** $80
- **Discount for veteran:** 25% off the standard rate

So, the **reduced rate** is:

$$
80 \times (1 - 0.25) = 80 \times 0.75 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate earnings from standard-rate lessons

Charlie has **4 one-hour lessons at the standard rate**:

$$
4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate earnings from veteran lessons

He has **2 one-hour lessons with a veteran** at the reduced rate:

$$
2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add both amounts to get total earnings

$$
320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$440**
To find Sally's **mean score**, we need to:

1. **Add up all the scores**.
2. **Divide the total by the number of scores**.

---

### Step 1: Add the scores

Sally's scores are:  
**50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60**

Let’s add them:

$$
50 + 80 = 130 \\
130 + 80 = 210 \\
210 + 60 = 270 \\
270 + 40 = 310 \\
310 + 90 = 400 \\
400 + 100 = 500 \\
500 + 70 = 570 \\
570 + 60 = 630
$$

So, the **total sum** is **630**.

---

### Step 2: Count the number of scores

There are **9** scores.

---

### Step 3: Divide the total by the number of scores

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{630}{9} = 70
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Sally's mean score is 70.**
We are told that Eve originally had **20 pomelos**.

After giving some away, she is left with **1/4 of the original amount**.

---

### Step 1: Find how many pomelos she has left

She has:
$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pomelos}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many she gave away

She started with 20 and now has 5, so the number of pomelos she gave away is:
$$
20 - 5 = 15
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Eve gave away **15 pomelos**.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total apples Walter bought**

Walter bought **60 apples**.

---

### **Step 2: Apples eaten by Walter**

He ate **2/5** of the apples:

$$
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
$$

So, he has:

$$
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples remaining}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Apples given to his sister**

He gave his sister **25%** of the remaining apples.

$$
25\% \text{ of } 36 = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
$$

So, after giving his sister 9 apples, he has:

$$
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples left}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Apples sold to his uncle**

He sold the remaining **27 apples** to his uncle at **$3 each**.

$$
27 \times 3 = 81
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{81}
$$

Walter received **$81** from selling the apples to his uncle.
We are told that:

- Regina wrote **9 novels last year**.
- This is **3 quarters** of the number of novels she has written **this year**.

Let’s define:

- Let $ x $ be the number of novels Regina wrote **this year**.

According to the problem:

$$
\frac{3}{4}x = 9
$$

Now solve for $ x $:

Multiply both sides by $ \frac{4}{3} $:

$$
x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3}
$$

$$
x = \frac{36}{3} = 12
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: Regina wrote **12 novels this year**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the problem**

Michael is traveling at an **average speed of 50 km/h** for **3 days**.  
We are to find what **percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km)** he has covered in that time.

---

### **Step 2: Convert time into hours**

There are **24 hours in a day**, so:

$$
3 \text{ days} = 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the distance Michael traveled**

He travels at **50 km/h** for **72 hours**, so:

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 50 \, \text{km/h} \times 72 \, \text{hours} = 3600 \, \text{km}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the total distance**

The total distance between Alaska and Texas is **6000 km**.

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Total distance}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{3600}{6000} \right) \times 100
$$

$$
\text{Percentage} = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\%
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{60\%}
$$

Michael has covered **60%** of the distance between Alaska and Texas in 3 days.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: **Madeline ate 6 grapes.**

So, Madeline used **6 grapes**.

---

### Step 2: **Her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline to make juice.**

That means he used:

$$
5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
$$

---

### Step 3: **Their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies.**

Each pie requires **12 grapes**, so for 4 pies:

$$
4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes}
$$

---

### Step 4: **Now, let’s find the total number of grapes at the beginning.**

We know:

- Madeline ate 6 grapes.
- Brother used 30 grapes.
- Mother used 48 grapes.

So total grapes at the beginning were:

$$
6 + 30 + 48 = 84
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **84 grapes**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total number of teachers at the school**: 82  
2. **Number of teachers who were sick**: 13  
3. **Number of substitute teachers called in**: 9  

We are asked: **How many teachers were at school that day?**

### Step 1: Find how many teachers were not sick
If 13 teachers were sick, then the number of teachers who were **not sick** is:

$$
82 - 13 = 69
$$

### Step 2: Add the substitute teachers
The 9 substitute teachers were called in to help, so we add them to the 69 teachers who were not sick:

$$
69 + 9 = 78
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**78 teachers were at school that day.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Cost of pasta
- Bud makes **macaroni and cheese once a week**.
- Each box of pasta costs **$1.00**.
- So, **weekly cost of pasta** = $1.00

---

### Step 2: Cost of cheese
- He spends **$3.00 on cheddar cheese**.
- He spends **twice that amount on gruyère cheese**, so:
  - Gruyère = 2 × $3.00 = **$6.00**
- Total cheese cost per week = $3.00 (cheddar) + $6.00 (gruyère) = **$9.00**

---

### Step 3: Total weekly cost
- Pasta: $1.00
- Cheese: $9.00
- **Total per week** = $1.00 + $9.00 = **$10.00**

---

### Step 4: Annual cost
- There are **52 weeks in a year**.
- Total annual cost = $10.00 × 52 = **$520.00**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.**
Let's break this down step by step to find **what percentage of their day is spent cleaning classrooms**.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of classrooms**
- There are **80 classrooms** to clean.

---

### **Step 2: Time per classroom**
- It takes **15 minutes** per classroom.

So, total time to clean all classrooms:

$$
80 \text{ classrooms} \times 15 \text{ minutes/classroom} = 1200 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total time in a day**
- The custodian works **8 hours per day**.
- Convert that to minutes:

$$
8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total time over 5 days**
- They have **5 days** to do the job.

$$
480 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 2400 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Percentage of time spent cleaning**

$$
\frac{\text{Time spent cleaning}}{\text{Total time}} \times 100 = \frac{1200}{2400} \times 100 = 50\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**50%** of their day, on average, is spent cleaning classrooms.
We are told that Elly has **110 books** and is organizing them on **bookcases** with **shelves** of different capacities. We need to determine **how many bookcases** she needs to hold all 110 books.

---

### Step 1: Understand the shelf capacities

We're told:

- **Each of the middle 2 shelves** can hold **10 books**.
- The **bottom shelf** can hold **twice as many as a middle shelf**, so:
  $$
  \text{Bottom shelf} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ books}
  $$
- The **top shelf** can hold **5 fewer books than the bottom shelf**, so:
  $$
  \text{Top shelf} = 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ books}
  $$

So, each **bookcase** has **3 shelves**:
- **Bottom**: 20 books
- **Middle (2 shelves)**: 10 books each → total of 20 books
- **Top**: 15 books

Let’s calculate how many books one **bookcase** can hold:

$$
\text{Total per bookcase} = 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many bookcases are needed

Elly has **110 books**.

Each bookcase holds **55 books**, so:

$$
\text{Number of bookcases} = \lceil \frac{110}{55} \rceil = \lceil 2 \rceil = 2
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{2}
$$

Elly needs **2 bookcases** to hold all 110 books.
Let's break this down step by step to find Rose's **profit**.

---

### **Step 1: Find the cost price**

Rose bought **five dozens of eggs**, and each dozen costs **$2.40**.

So, total **cost price (CP)** is:

$$
5 \text{ dozen} \times \$2.40/\text{dozen} = \$12.00
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the selling price**

She sells the eggs at **$1 for 3 eggs**.

First, let's find out how many eggs that is in a dozen:

- 1 dozen = 12 eggs  
- So, $1 for 3 eggs means she sells **4 sets of 3 eggs** per dozen (since 12 ÷ 3 = 4)

That means she sells **4 sets of 3 eggs** for **$1 per set**, so:

$$
4 \text{ sets} \times \$1/\text{set} = \$4.00 \text{ per dozen}
$$

So, **selling price (SP) per dozen** is **\$4.00**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate profit per dozen**

$$
\text{Profit per dozen} = \text{SP} - \text{CP} = \$4.00 - \$2.40 = \$1.60
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total profit for 5 dozen**

$$
5 \text{ dozen} \times \$1.60/\text{dozen} = \$8.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\$8.00}
$$

Rose’s **profit** is **\$8.00**.
We are told that Skyler has **100 hats** in total, and they are colored **red**, **blue**, and **white**.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of red hats

We're told:

> Half of the hats are red.

So:

$$
\text{Red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the number of remaining hats (after removing red hats)

$$
\text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the number of blue hats

We're told:

> 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.

So:

$$
\text{Blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
$$

---

### Step 4: Find the number of white hats

The rest of the hats are white. So:

$$
\text{White hats} = 100 - (\text{Red} + \text{Blue}) = 100 - (50 + 30) = 100 - 80 = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{20}
$$

Skyler has **20 white hats**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find the original price per bag**
The problem says:
- Each bag contains **30 sticks of jerky**.
- The **original price per bag is $18.00**.

So, the **original price per stick** would be:

$$
\frac{18.00}{30} = 0.60 \text{ dollars per stick}
$$

But we are not asked about the original price — we are told that **Archie buys the bag while it's $3.00 off**, so we need to use the **discounted price**.

---

### **Step 2: Find the discounted price per bag**
The bag is **$3.00 off**, so:

$$
18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00 \text{ dollars per bag (discounted)}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the cost per stick at the discounted price**
Now divide the discounted price by the number of sticks in a bag:

$$
\frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50 \text{ dollars per stick}
$$

Convert that to **cents**:

$$
0.50 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ cents}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{50} \text{ cents per stick}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the requirements**

Audrey needs to **correctly answer 70% of the total questions** across **both tests** to move on to 7th grade.

So, if we let:

- $ T $ = total number of questions across both tests
- $ C $ = number of correct answers she needs (i.e., 70% of $ T $)

Then:

$$
C = 0.7 \times T
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the total number of questions**

First test: 70 questions  
Second test: 40 questions  

$$
T = 70 + 40 = 110
$$

So, she needs to get:

$$
C = 0.7 \times 110 = 77 \text{ questions correct}
$$

---

### **Step 3: How many did she get right on the first test?**

She got 60% of 70 correct:

$$
\text{Correct on first test} = 0.6 \times 70 = 42
$$

---

### **Step 4: How many does she need to get right on the second test?**

She already has 42 correct from the first test.

She needs a total of 77 correct.

So, the number of correct answers needed on the second test is:

$$
77 - 42 = 35
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Audrey needs to get **35 questions correct** on the second test to move on to 7th grade.
We are given:

- Let the number of **strawberry cubes** be $ s $.
- The number of **blueberry cubes** is $ 5s - 4 $.
- Total number of ice cubes = 116.

---

### Step 1: Write the total number of cubes in terms of $ s $

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Strawberry cubes} + \text{Blueberry cubes}
$$

$$
s + (5s - 4) = 116
$$

---

### Step 2: Simplify the equation

$$
s + 5s - 4 = 116
$$

$$
6s - 4 = 116
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ s $

$$
6s = 116 + 4 = 120
$$

$$
s = \frac{120}{6} = 20
$$

---

### Step 4: Find the number of blueberry cubes

$$
\text{Blueberry cubes} = 5s - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{96}
$$

Mary makes **96 blueberry cubes**.

2. **Games per year**: 40 games  
3. **Points per game**: 21 points  

### Step 1: Total number of games played in 4 years  
$$
4 \text{ years} \times 40 \text{ games/year} = 160 \text{ games}
$$

### Step 2: Total points scored  
$$
160 \text{ games} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 3,360 \text{ points}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**3,360 points**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Start:**
- Brendan has **10 marbles** in a bag.

---

### **Step 1: Dropped half of them**
- He drops **half** of the 10 marbles.
- Half of 10 is **5**, so he drops **5 marbles**.
- That means he now has **5 marbles left** in his hand.

---

### **Step 2: Found 3 marbles**
- He searches and finds **3 marbles**.
- So now, he has **5 (left from before) + 3 (found) = 8 marbles**.

---

### **Step 3: Inspected the marbles**
- He inspects them further and finds **one that isn't a marble** — it's a **bead**.
- He gets rid of it.
- So he removes **1 marble** from his total.

---

### **Final Count:**
- He had **8 marbles** after finding 3.
- He removes **1** because it was a bead, not a marble.
- So, he ends up with **7 marbles**.

---

### ✅ **Answer: 7 marbles**.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many **telephone calls** Jason needs to make in order to **sell 15 cars**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the conversion rates

We are given:

- **For every 25 telephone calls**, Jason gets **1 person** to come into the dealership.
- **For every 2 customers** that come into the dealership, **1 will buy a car**.

So we need to find out how many **calls** are needed to get **15 cars sold**.

---

### Step 2: Work backwards from the number of cars

We want to sell **15 cars**.

From the second rate:
- For every **2 customers**, **1 buys a car**.
- So, to get **15 cars**, we need **15 × 2 = 30 customers**.

---

### Step 3: Now find how many calls are needed for 30 customers

From the first rate:
- For every **25 calls**, **1 customer** comes in.
- So, for **30 customers**, we need:

$$
\text{Number of calls} = 30 \times 25 = 750
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Jason needs to make **750 telephone calls** to sell **15 cars** and earn his bonus.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out **how many candles and flashlights** Brianna's family is using when the power goes out.

---

### **Step 1: Flashlights**

- There are **4 people** in the house (including Brianna).
- Each person carries a **flashlight**.
- So, number of **flashlights** = 4.

---

### **Step 2: Candles**

There are **8 rooms** in the house.  
The candles are distributed as follows:

- **Half the rooms** have **4 small candles each**.
- The other **half the rooms** have **5 medium candles each**.

So:

- Half of 8 rooms = 4 rooms
- 4 rooms × 4 small candles = **16 small candles**
- 4 rooms × 5 medium candles = **20 medium candles**

Total number of **candles** = 16 + 20 = **36 candles**

---

### **Step 3: Total items used**

- Flashlights: **4**
- Candles: **36**

So, total number of **candles and flashlights** = 4 + 36 = **40**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**40 candles and flashlights** are being used when the power goes out.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **How many bags of chips does Mitchell buy?**  
   → 2 bags

2. **How many chips are in each bag?**  
   → 55 chips per bag

3. **Total number of chips:**  
   $ 2 \text{ bags} \times 55 \text{ chips per bag} = 110 \text{ chips} $

4. **How many family members are there?**  
   → 5 people

5. **How many chips does each person get if they all get the same number?**  
   $ \frac{110 \text{ chips}}{5 \text{ people}} = 22 \text{ chips per person} $

### ✅ Final Answer: Each person gets **22 chips**.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how long it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube.

---

### Step 1: Understand the time for each side

We are told:

- **First side**: Takes **5 minutes**
- **Second and third sides**: Each take **twice** that long →  
  $ 2 \times 5 = 10 $ minutes per side
- **Fourth and fifth sides**: Each take **half** as long as the first →  
  $ \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 $ minutes per side
- Once you get to the **fifth side**, you have **all 6 sides** (so the sixth side is not actually done, but we just stop at the fifth).

So we only need to calculate the time for the **first five sides**.

---

### Step 2: Add up the times

- First side: 5 minutes  
- Second side: 10 minutes  
- Third side: 10 minutes  
- Fourth side: 2.5 minutes  
- Fifth side: 2.5 minutes  

Now add them all together:

$$
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**It takes John 30 minutes to complete the Rubik's cube.**
We are given the following information:

- Dominick saw **half as many robots as helmets**.
- He also saw **half as many helmets as footballs**.
- There were **20 helmets**.

Let’s break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of robots

We are told:
> "Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets."

So, if there were **20 helmets**, then the number of **robots** is:

$$
\text{Robots} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Helmet count} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the number of footballs

We are told:
> "He saw half as many helmets as footballs."

This means:
$$
\text{Helmet count} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Football count}
$$

We know the helmet count is **20**, so we solve for footballs:

$$
20 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Football count} \Rightarrow \text{Football count} = 20 \times 2 = 40
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate total number of items

Now we add up all the items Dominick saw:

- **Robots**: 10  
- **Helmet**: 20  
- **Footballs**: 40  

$$
\text{Total items} = 10 + 20 + 40 = 70
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{70}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find out how many minutes Tim spends answering phones each day.**

He spends **6 hours** at work each day, and we need to convert that into **minutes**:

$$
6 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many calls he can handle in one day.**

Each call takes **15 minutes**, so the number of calls per day is:

$$
\frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total number of calls in a 5-day work week.**

$$
24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ calls}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 120 calls**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the drying time for one painting

- **Old varnish**: 7 minutes per painting  
- **New varnish**: 12 minutes per painting  

So, the **difference in drying time per painting** is:

$$
12 - 7 = 5 \text{ minutes per painting}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total extra time for 6 paintings

If each painting takes **5 minutes longer** with the new varnish, then for 6 paintings:

$$
5 \text{ minutes/painting} \times 6 \text{ paintings} = 30 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

It will take **30 minutes longer** for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings to dry with the new varnish compared to the old varnish.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Total number of plants
Crista has **20 plants** in total.

---

### Step 2: Categorize the plants based on water needs

- **4 plants** need **½ cup** of water each.
- **8 plants** need **1 cup** of water each.
- The **remaining plants** need **¼ cup** of water each.

First, let's find out how many plants are in the last category:

$$
20 - 4 - 8 = 8 \text{ plants}
$$

So:
- 4 plants → ½ cup each
- 8 plants → 1 cup each
- 8 plants → ¼ cup each

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total water needed for each group

#### For the 4 plants that need ½ cup:
$$
4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2 \text{ cups}
$$

#### For the 8 plants that need 1 cup:
$$
8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ cups}
$$

#### For the 8 plants that need ¼ cup:
$$
8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add up all the water needed

$$
2 + 8 + 2 = 12 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.**
We are told that Phineas Frog is 200 yards away from his home and needs to return. The total distance is **200 yards**, and **half of the distance is on land**, and **the other half is in water**.

---

### Step 1: Determine the distances for each part of the journey

- Total distance = 200 yards
- Half of the distance is on land:  
  $$
  \frac{200}{2} = 100 \text{ yards (on land)}
  $$
- The other half is in water:  
  $$
  \frac{200}{2} = 100 \text{ yards (in water)}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Use the given speeds

- Speed on land = 20 yards per minute  
- Speed in water = 10 yards per minute

---

### Step 3: Calculate the time taken for each part of the journey

- Time on land:  
  $$
  \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{20 \text{ yards per minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
  $$

- Time in water:  
  $$
  \frac{100 \text{ yards}}{10 \text{ yards per minute}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
  $$

---

### Step 4: Add the times together

$$
5 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{15} \text{ minutes}

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **How many popsicle sticks does Bob need?**  
   He needs **56 popsicle sticks**.

2. **How many sticks are in each box?**  
   Each box has **8 popsicle sticks**.

3. **How many boxes does Bob need to buy?**  
   To find this, divide the total number of sticks needed by the number per box:  
   $$
   \frac{56}{8} = 7
   $$  
   So, Bob needs **7 boxes**.

4. **How much does each box cost?**  
   Each box costs **$2.00**.

5. **Total cost:**  
   Multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:  
   $$
   7 \times 2 = 14
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$14.00**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Given:
- There are **five phones** on the phone plan.
- The **main phone** costs **twice as much** as each **additional phone**.
- The **main phone plan** (i.e., the cost of the main phone) is **$20**.

We are asked to find the **total cost** of the whole phone plan.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s define:

- Let the **cost of each additional phone** be **x** dollars.
- Then, the **cost of the main phone** is **2x** dollars.

But we are told that the **main phone plan costs $20**, so:

$$
2x = 20
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for x

$$
x = \frac{20}{2} = 10
$$

So, each **additional phone** costs **$10**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate total cost

There are **five phones** in total:

- 1 main phone → cost = $20

Let's break this down step by step and calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.

---

### **Day 1:**
- Number of people = **50**

---

### **Day 2:**
- 20 more people than Day 1
- So, Day 2 = 50 + 20 = **70**

---

### **Day 3:**
- Total number of people is **twice** the number on Day 2
- So, Day 3 = 2 × 70 = **140**

---

### **Days 4 to 7 (the rest of the week):**
- The problem says Conor saw an **average of 60 people each day** for the rest of the week.
- There are **4 more days** (Day 4 to Day 7)
- So, total for these 4 days = 4 × 60 = **240**

---

### **Total for the whole week:**
- Day 1: 50  
- Day 2: 70  
- Day 3: 140  
- Days 4–7: 240  

Now add them all up:

$$
50 + 70 + 140 + 240 = \boxed{500}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{500}
$$

Conor saw a total of **500 people** at the beach that week.
Let's break down the problem step by step and calculate the total number of kernels that pop.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the popping rate over time**

We are told:

- **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop.
- **Next 30 seconds (second interval)**: 3 times that amount = 3 × 20 = **60 kernels**.
- **Next 30 seconds (third interval)**: 4 times the initial rate = 4 × 20 = **80 kernels**.
- **Final 30 seconds (fourth interval)**: Half the rate of the previous interval = ½ × 80 = **40 kernels**.
- **After cooking is done**, a quarter of the number that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop due to residual heat = ¼ × 40 = **10 kernels**.

---

### **Step 2: Add up all the popped kernels**

Let’s add them up:

- First 30 seconds: **20**
- Second 30 seconds: **60**
- Third 30 seconds: **80**
- Fourth 30 seconds: **40**
- Residual heat: **10**

Now sum them:

$$
20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = \boxed{210}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

### **Step 1: How much lemon juice is needed for 4 gallons of lemonade?**

- The recipe says **1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon of lemonade**.
- So, for **4 gallons**, Tim needs:

$$
4 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ cup/gallon} = 4 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
$$

---

### **Step 2: How many lemons are needed to get 4 cups of lemon juice?**

- **6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice.**
- So, to get **4 cups**, he needs:

$$
4 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 24 \text{ lemons}
$$

So, **24 lemons** are needed for the **4 gallons** of lemonade.

---

### **Step 3: Allen wants an extra gallon that is **twice as tart** as the others.**

- That means the **extra gallon** will be made with **twice as much lemon juice** as a normal gallon.
- A normal gallon uses **1 cup** of lemon juice.
- So, the **extra gallon** will use:

$$
2 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
$$

---

### **Step 4: How many lemons are needed for 2 cups of lemon juice?**

$$
2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons/cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Total number of lemons needed**

- For the original 4 gallons: **24 lemons**
- For the extra gallon (twice as tart): **12 lemons**

$$
24 + 12 = \boxed{36} \text{ lemons}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Tim will need 36 lemons.**
Let's solve this step by step.

### **Step 1: Determine the daily food consumption for each breed**

- **German Shepherd**:  
  Each German Shepherd consumes **5 kg** of dog food per day.  
  There are **3 German Shepherds**, so:  
  $$
  3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ kg/day}
  $$

- **Bulldog**:  
  Each Bulldog consumes **3 kg** of dog food per day.  
  There are **2 Bulldogs**, so:  
  $$
  2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ kg/day}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Total daily food consumption**

Add the food consumed by both breeds:  
$$
15 \text{ kg (German Shepherds)} + 6 \text{ kg (Bulldogs)} = 21 \text{ kg/day}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total weekly food consumption**

There are **7 days** in a week, so:  
$$
21 \text{ kg/day} \times 7 = 147 \text{ kg/week}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{147} \text{ kilograms of dog food needed in a week}
$$
We are given:

- 10 **2-legged animals** (e.g., chickens)
- 15 **4-legged animals** (e.g., cows, horses)

We are to find the **total number of pairs of animal legs** on the farm.

---

### Step 1: Calculate total number of legs

Each 2-legged animal has **2 legs**, so:

$$
10 \text{ animals} \times 2 \text{ legs/animal} = 20 \text{ legs}
$$

Each 4-legged animal has **4 legs**, so:

$$
15 \text{ animals} \times 4 \text{ legs/animal} = 60 \text{ legs}
$$

Now add them together:

$$
20 + 60 = 80 \text{ legs}
$$

---

### Step 2: Convert total legs into pairs

Since each **pair of legs** is 2 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:

$$
\frac{80}{2} = 40 \text{ pairs of legs}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{40}
$$
We are told:

- The tower is made of **4 blue blocks**.
- There are **twice as many yellow blocks** as blue blocks.
- There are an **unknown number of red blocks**.
- The **total number of blocks is 32**.

---

### Step 1: Determine the number of yellow blocks

We're told there are **twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks**.

- Blue blocks = 4  
- Yellow blocks = 2 × 4 = **8**

---

### Step 2: Add blue and yellow blocks

- Blue = 4  
- Yellow = 8  
- Total so far = 4 + 8 = **12**

---

### Step 3: Find the number of red blocks

Total blocks = 32  
Blocks already accounted for (blue + yellow) = 12  
So, red blocks = 32 − 12 = **20**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{20}
$$

There are **20 red blocks** in the tower.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the journey**

Elvis starts at his house and:

- **First part**: Drives **west** for **5 hours** at an average speed of **18 mph**.
- **Second part**: Turns around and drives **east** for **8 hours** at the same speed of **18 mph**.

We are to find how far Elvis is from his **house** after the entire journey.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate distance traveled in each direction**

#### **Westbound trip:**
- Time = 5 hours
- Speed = 18 mph  
- Distance = Speed × Time = $ 18 \times 5 = 90 $ miles

So, he is **90 miles west** of his house after the first part.

#### **Eastbound trip:**
- Time = 8 hours
- Speed = 18 mph  
- Distance = $ 18 \times 8 = 144 $ miles

So, he travels **144 miles east** from where he was after the first leg.

---

### **Step 3: Determine final position relative to the house**

- After the first leg, he is **90 miles west** of his house.
- Then he travels **144 miles east**.

To find his final position, subtract the westward distance from the eastward distance (since they are in opposite directions):

$$
\text{Final position} = 144 - 90 = 54 \text{ miles east of his house}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{54} \text{ miles}
$$

Elvis is **54 miles east** of his house.
Let's calculate the value of the boat step by step after each year.

---

### **Initial Value:**
Gary bought the boat for **$9000**.

---

### **First Year Depreciation (30%):**

Depreciation = 30% of $9000  
= $ 0.30 × 9000 = $2700

New value after first year:  
= $9000 - $2700 = **$6300**

---

### **Second Year Depreciation (30%):**

Depreciation = 30% of $6300  
= $ 0.30 × 6300 = $1890

New value after second year:  
= $6300 - $1890 = **$4410**

---

### **Third Year Depreciation (20%):**

Depreciation = 20% of $4410  
= $ 0.20 × 4410 = $882

New value after third year:  
= $4410 - $882 = **$3528**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
After three years, the boat is worth **$3528**.
We are given the total number of Starburst candies in a bag: **232**.

We are also told:

- Red candies: **54**
- Orange candies: **twice that amount of red candies** → $ 2 \times 54 = 108 $
- Yellow candies: **half as many as red candies** → $ \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27 $

Now, let's add up the number of red, orange, and yellow candies:

$$
54 \text{ (red)} + 108 \text{ (orange)} + 27 \text{ (yellow)} = 189
$$

So far, we have accounted for **189** candies.

Now subtract this from the total to find how many are **pink**:

$$
232 - 189 = 43
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **43 pink candies**.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Cost of the hotel
Helen stayed at the hotel for **3 nights**, and each night cost **$80**.

$$
\text{Total hotel cost} = 3 \times 80 = 240 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 2: Cost of the bus rides
She rode the bus **7 times**, and each bus ride cost **10% of the price of one night at the hotel**.

First, calculate 10% of $80:

$$
10\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \text{ dollars per bus ride}
$$

Now, multiply by 7 for the total bus cost:

$$
\text{Total bus cost} = 7 \times 8 = 56 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total cost
Now, add the hotel and bus costs together:

$$
\text{Total cost} = 240 + 56 = 296 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Helen paid $296 for the hotel and bus travels during the trip.**
We are told:

- Mazie starts with **52 marbles**.
- She gives them to **Dallas and Darla**, the twins.
- After **dropping 4 marbles in the playground**, **Dallas has a total of 21 marbles**.

We need to find out **how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla**.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many marbles Dallas had before dropping any

Dallas ends up with **21 marbles** after dropping **4**. That means **before** he dropped the marbles, he had:

$$
21 + 4 = 25 \text{ marbles}
$$

So, **Dallas received 25 marbles from Mazie**.

---

### Step 2: Total marbles given to both twins

Mazie had **52 marbles** and gave all of them to Dallas and Darla. So the total number of marbles given to both is:

$$
52 \text{ marbles}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find how many marbles were given to Darla

We already know Dallas got **25 marbles**, so Darla must have gotten:

$$
52 - 25 = 27 \text{ marbles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{27}
$$

Mazie gave **27 marbles to Darla**.

So, 2 nickels = 2 × 5 = **10 cents**

---

### Step 3: Value of a dime  
A dime is worth **10 cents**.

So, 7 dimes = 7 × 10 = **70 cents**

---

### Step 4: Add them all together  
Now, add up the values:

- Quarters: 25 cents  
- Nickels: 10 cents  
- Dimes: 70 cents  

Total = 25 + 10 + 70 = **105 cents**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **105 cents**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Identify the number of siblings
- There are **2 brothers** and **3 sisters**, so in total:
  $$
  2 + 3 = 5 \text{ siblings}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Determine the ages of each sibling

- **All sisters are the same age**, and they are **16 years old**.
  - So, each sister is **16**.
  - That’s **3 sisters × 16 = 48** total age for the sisters.

- One of the **brothers is 12 years old**.
- The **older brother** is **twice as old** as this 12-year-old.
  - So, the older brother is:
    $$
    2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ years old}
    $$
  - That’s **1 brother × 24 = 24** total age for the older brother.

- We don’t know the age of the **other brother**, but we only have one brother (the older one) whose age is given. Since there are **2 brothers**, and one is 12, the other must be **either the older brother (24)** or a younger brother.

Wait — this seems like a possible misinterpretation. Let's clarify:

We are told:

- One of the brothers is **12 years old**.
- That brother is **half the age of the older brother**.
- So the **older brother is 24**.
- That means the two brothers are **12 and 24**.

So the **two brothers** are:
- One is **12**
- One is **24**

---

### Step 3: Add up all the ages

- Sisters: 3 × 16 = **48**
- Brothers: 12 + 24 = **36**

Now add them together:
$$
48 + 36 = \boxed{84}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{84}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much time Charisma spends on meditation and yoga in **4 weeks**.

---

### **Step 1: Time spent on meditation per day**
- She meditates **2 times a day**:  
  - 15 minutes in the morning  
  - 15 minutes before bed  
- Total meditation time per day = **15 + 15 = 30 minutes**

---

### **Step 2: Total meditation time per week**
- She does this every day, so:
- 30 minutes/day × 7 days/week = **210 minutes/week**

---

### **Step 3: Time spent on yoga per week**
- She practices **1 hour of yoga 5 days a week**.
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- So, 60 minutes/day × 5 days/week = **300 minutes/week**

---

### **Step 4: Total time per week (meditation + yoga)**
- Meditation: 210 minutes  
- Yoga: 300 minutes  
- Total = **210 + 300 = 510 minutes/week**

---

### **Step 5: Total time over 4 weeks**
- 510 minutes/week × 4 weeks = **2040 minutes**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Charisma has spent 2040 minutes on meditation and yoga practice in 4 weeks.**
We are given the following:

- **Small t-shirt**: 3 square feet  
- **Medium t-shirt**: 4 square feet  
- **Large t-shirt**: 6 square feet  

She uses:

- **11 small shirts**  
- **8 medium shirts**  
- **6 large shirts**

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total area for each size

  $ 11 \text{ shirts} \times 3 \text{ sq ft} = 33 \text{ sq ft} $

- **Medium shirts**:  
  $ 8 \text{ shirts} \times 4 \text{ sq ft} = 32 \text{ sq ft} $

- **Large shirts**:  
  $ 6 \text{ shirts} \times 6 \text{ sq ft} = 36 \text{ sq ft} $

---

### Step 2: Add them all together

$$
33 + 32 + 36 = 101 \text{ square feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The quilt is 101 square feet.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the quantities

- A **small sunflower** has **3 dozen seeds**.
  - Since 1 dozen = 12, then:
    $$
    3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ seeds}
    $$

- A **large sunflower** has **50% more seeds** than a small sunflower.
  - To find 50% of 36:
    $$
    50\% \text{ of } 36 = 0.5 \times 36 = 18
    $$
  - So, the large sunflower has:
    $$
    36 + 18 = 54 \text{ seeds}
    $$

---

### Step 2: Add the seeds from both sunflowers

- Small sunflower: 36 seeds  
- Large sunflower: 54 seeds  

$$
\text{Total seeds} = 36 + 54 = 90
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{90}
$$
We are given the following information:

- **George has 18 pens.**
- **Timothy has three times the number of pens that George has.**
- **Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy.**

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find how many pens Timothy has

Timothy has **three times** the number of pens that George has.

$$
\text{Timothy's pens} = 3 \times \text{George's pens} = 3 \times 18 = 54
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many pens Sarah has

Sarah has **half as many** pens as Timothy.

$$
\text{Sarah's pens} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's pens} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54 = 27
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{27}
$$

Sarah has **27 pens**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information

- **Albert's height**: 36 inches  
- **Anne is twice the size of Albert** → So, Anne's height = 2 × Albert's height  
- **Jackie is 2 inches shorter than Anne**  
- **Jackie grew 3 inches over the summer**  
- We are asked to find **Jackie's height before summer**

---

### Step 2: Find Anne's height

$$
\text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Albert's height} = 2 \times 36 = 72 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find Jackie's current height (after growing)

$$
\text{Jackie's current height} = \text{Anne's height} - 2 = 72 - 2 = 70 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find Jackie's height before summer

Jackie grew **3 inches** over the summer, so her height **before** summer was:

$$
\text{Jackie's height before summer} = \text{Current height} - 3 = 70 - 3 = 67 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Jackie was 67 inches tall before summer.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many bars are produced in one day  
The company produces **5000 bars per day**.

### Step 2: Determine how many days are in two weeks  
There are **7 days in a week**, so in **two weeks**, there are:  
$$
2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ days}
$$

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks  
$$
5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70,000 \text{ bars}
$$

### Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the bars  
Each bar is sold for **$2**, so:  
$$
70,000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140,000 \text{ dollars}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
The company will receive **$140,000** for selling the chocolate bars during two weeks.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much **Jake spends in total**.

---

### **Step 1: T-shirts**

- **Deal:** Buy one, get one **50% off**.
- **Number of T-shirts:** 2
- **Original price per T-shirt:** $8

Since it's a **buy one, get one 50% off** deal, Jake pays full price for the first T-shirt and **half price** for the second one.

- First T-shirt: $8 (full price)
- Second T-shirt: $8 × 50% = $4

**Total cost for T-shirts:**
$$
8 + 4 = \$12
$$

---

### **Step 2: Shoes**

- **Original price of shoes:** $40
- **Discount:** 40% off

So Jake pays **60%** of the original price.

$$
40 × (1 - 0.40) = 40 × 0.60 = \$24
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total Amount Spent**

Now, add up the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes:

$$
\text{Total} = \text{T-shirts} + \text{Shoes} = 12 + 24 = \$36
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jake spends a total of \$36 at the store.**

Let's go through the problem step by step to figure out how many cookies Randy has now.

---

### **Initial Count:**

- **Oatmeal cookies:** 9  
- **Chocolate chip cookies:** 4  
- **Sugar cookies:** 5  

**Total initial cookies = 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies**

---

### **Step 1: He ate 3 cookies for an early day snack, one of each flavor.**

So he ate:
- 1 oatmeal
- 1 chocolate chip
- 1 sugar

**Remaining cookies after this:**

- Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = **8**
- Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = **3**
- Sugar: 5 - 1 = **4**

**Total remaining: 8 + 3 + 4 = 15 cookies**

---

### **Step 2: He ate 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.**

- Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = **6**
- Chocolate chip: still 3
- Sugar: still 4

**Total remaining: 6 + 3 + 4 = 13 cookies**

---

### **Step 3: He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends.**

- Sugar: 4 - 2 = **2**
- Oatmeal: still 6
- Chocolate chip: still 3

**Total remaining: 6 + 3 + 2 = 11 cookies**

---

### **Step 4: He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner.**

He bakes:
- 4 oatmeal
- 4 chocolate chip
- 4 sugar

So we add these to the current count:

- Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = **10**
- Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = **7**
- Sugar: 2 + 4 = **6**

**Total cookies now = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 23 cookies**
We are given:

- Matthew has **12 unique toy soldiers**.
- A buyer is willing to pay:
  - **$5 per toy** for **half** of the collection.
  - **$7 per toy** for the **other half**.

We need to calculate how much money Matthew would earn if he agrees to this offer.

---

### Step 1: Divide the collection into two equal parts

Since there are 12 toy soldiers, and the buyer is paying different prices for **half** of them:

$$
\text{Half of 12} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
$$

So, the buyer will pay:

- **$5 per toy** for **6 toys**
- **$7 per toy** for **6 toys**

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings

$$
\text{Earnings from first half} = 6 \times 5 = 30
$$
$$
\text{Earnings from second half} = 6 \times 7 = 42
$$

$$
\text{Total earnings} = 30 + 42 = \boxed{72}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Matthew would earn **$72** if he agrees to the buyer's offer.
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation**

- The dog digs **6 holes per day**.
- Nate is on vacation for **14 days**.
- So, total number of holes dug in 14 days:

$$
6 \text{ holes/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ holes}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Understand the situation after Nate returns**

- When Nate gets home, he **fills in 9 holes per day**.
- But **each night**, the dog **digs 6 new holes**.
- So, every day, the net change in the number of holes is:

$$
\text{Net change per day} = \text{Holes filled} - \text{Holes dug} = 9 - 6 = 3 \text{ holes}
$$

So, **every day**, the total number of holes **decreases by 3**.

---

### **Step 3: How many days does it take to fill all the holes?**

We start with **84 holes**, and each day the number of holes decreases by **3**.

We want to find how many full days it takes to get from **84 holes** to **0 holes**.

$$
\frac{84}{3} = 28 \text{ days}
$$

So, it takes **28 days** to fill in all the holes.

---

### **Step 4: Convert days into weeks**

$$
\frac{28 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 4 \text{ weeks}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{4 \text{ weeks}}
$$

---

### Step 1: Find the average enrollment at Butler High School

$$
\text{Butler's enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000 \text{ students}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the difference in enrollments

$$
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000 \text{ students}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
The average enrollment at **Norman High School is 1000 students greater** than that at Butler High School.
We are given the total number of cookies made by the Adams family and the number of two types of cookies. We need to find how many **chocolate chip cookies** they have made.

---

### Step 1: Total number of cookies
They've made a total of:

$$
7995 \text{ cookies}
$$

---

### Step 2: Number of rainbow cookies
They have:

$$
2595 \text{ rainbow cookies}
$$

---

### Step 3: Number of oatmeal cookies
They have:

$$
3075 \text{ oatmeal cookies}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find the number of chocolate chip cookies

To find the number of chocolate chip cookies, subtract the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies from the total:

$$
\text{Chocolate chip cookies} = 7995 - (2595 + 3075)
$$

First, add the rainbow and oatmeal cookies:

$$
2595 + 3075 = 5670
$$

Now subtract from the total:

$$
7995 - 5670 = 2325
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{2325} \text{ chocolate chip cookies}
$$
We are given a problem involving the number of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes that Igor was supposed to gather, but he made some mistakes. We need to determine **how many beakers Igor lost**.

---

### Step 1: Understand what was requested

- **Test tubes:** 16  
- **Beakers:** 7  
- **Petri dishes:** 14  

Igor was supposed to place all of these on the lab bench, but he made some errors:

---

### Step 2: Analyze what Igor actually did

#### Test Tubes:
He gathered **half as many** as requested.

$$
\text{Test tubes} = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8
$$

#### Petri Dishes:
He gathered **two more than the number of Petri dishes requested**.

$$
\text{Petri dishes} = 14 + 2 = 16
$$

#### Beakers:
He had the **correct number** of beakers, which is 7, **but lost several on the way**. So the number of beakers **on the bench** is less than 7.

Let’s call the number of beakers **lost** = $ x $.  
Then the number of beakers **on the bench** is $ 7 - x $.

---

### Step 3: Total items placed on the bench

The total number of items on the bench is 29.

So we can write the equation:

$$
\text{Test tubes} + \text{Beakers on bench} + \text{Petri dishes} = 29
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
8 + (7 - x) + 16 = 29
$$

Simplify:

$$
8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \\
31 - x = 29
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
x = 31 - 29 = 2
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{2}
$$

Igor **lost 2 beakers**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the total number of legs

James is putting together **4 tables**, and each table has **4 legs**.

$$
\text{Total legs} = 4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 16 \text{ legs}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many screws are needed

Each leg requires **2 screws**.

$$
\text{Total screws needed} = 16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 32 \text{ screws}
$$

---

### Step 3: Subtract from the total number of screws James has

James has **40 screws**.

$$
\text{Screws left over} = 40 - 32 = 8
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**James will have 8 screws left over.**
Let's solve this step by step.

1. The first basket has **10 eggs**.
2. The second basket has **twice as many eggs** as the first basket.
   - So, the second basket has:  
     $ 2 \times 10 = 20 $ eggs.
3. To find the total number of eggs in both baskets, add them together:
   - First basket: 10 eggs  
   - Second basket: 20 eggs  
   - Total: $ 10 + 20 = 30 $ eggs.

### Final Answer: **30 eggs**.
Let's break this down step by step.

We are given:

1. **Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra**, and **Alexandra raises $430**.
2. **Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah**, and **Sarah raises $300**.

---

### Step 1: Find how much Kim raises

Kim = Alexandra + $320  
= $430 + $320  
= **$750**

---

### Step 2: Find how much Maryam raises

Maryam = Sarah + $400  
= $300 + $400  
= **$700**

---

### Step 3: Add up all the amounts raised

- Kim: $750  
- Alexandra: $430  
- Maryam: $700  
- Sarah: $300  

Total = $750 + $430 + $700 + $300

Let’s add them:

- $750 + $430 = $1,180  
- $700 + $300 = $1,000  
- $1,180 + $1,000 = **$2,180**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$2,180**
We are given the following information:

- **Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.**
- **Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron does.**
- **Vanessa ran 4 miles.**
- **Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.**

We are to find **how long Vanessa took to complete her part**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between their speeds

Let’s define some variables:

- Let $ v $ be Vanessa's speed (in miles per minute).
- Then Aaron's speed is $ 2v $, since he runs **twice as fast** as Vanessa.

---

### Step 2: Use the distance and time relationship

We know that:

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
$$

Let’s denote:

- Distance that **Vanessa** ran = 4 miles.
- Distance that **Aaron** ran = ?

From the problem: **Vanessa ran twice as far as Aaron did.**

So:

$$
\text{Vanessa's distance} = 2 \times \text{Aaron's distance}
$$

$$
4 = 2 \times \text{Aaron's distance} \Rightarrow \text{Aaron's distance} = 2 \text{ miles}
$$

### Step 3: Use Aaron’s time to find his speed

We are told that **Aaron completed his part in 16 minutes**, and he ran **2 miles**.

So his speed is:

$$
\text{Speed of Aaron} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}
$$

But earlier, we said that Aaron's speed is **twice** Vanessa's speed:

$$
\text{Aaron's speed} = 2 \times \text{Vanessa's speed}
$$

So:

$$
\frac{1}{8} = 2v \Rightarrow v = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find how long it took Vanessa to run 4 miles

Now that we know Vanessa's speed is $ \frac{1}{16} $ miles per minute, we can compute the time she took to run 4 miles:

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{16}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{64} \text{ minutes}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Determine how much line is needed per foot of dock**

The caretaker needs **3 feet of line for every foot of dock**.

So, for **1 foot of dock**, he needs **3 feet of line**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total line needed for the current dock**

There are currently **200 feet of dock**.

So, the total line needed is:

$$
200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 \text{ feet of line per foot of dock} = 600 \text{ feet of line}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Subtract the line he already has**

He already has **6 feet of new line**.

So, the amount of line he still needs to buy is:

$$
600 \text{ feet} - 6 \text{ feet} = 594 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{594} \text{ feet of line}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Determine how many reservations per day**
Tom's restaurant gets **6 reservations a night**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine the cost per reservation**
Each reservation includes:
- **2 meals** at **$5 each** → $2 × $5 = **$10**
- **1 bottle of wine** at **$5**

So, total cost per reservation = **$10 + $5 = $15**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate daily revenue**
They get **6 reservations per night**, and each reservation brings in **$15**.

Daily revenue = **6 × $15 = $90**

---

### **Step 4: Determine how many days per week they are open**
They are open **2 days a week**.

---

### **Step 5: Calculate weekly revenue**
Weekly revenue = **$90/day × 2 days/week = $180**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $180 per week**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**

- The vendor bought **50 watermelons** for **$80**.
- He sold **all of them** at a **profit of 25%**.
- We are to find the **selling price per watermelon**.

---

### **Step 2: Find the cost price per watermelon**

The total cost for 50 watermelons is $80.

$$
\text{Cost price per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the selling price per watermelon with 25% profit**

A profit of 25% means the selling price is **125% of the cost price**.

$$
\text{Selling price per watermelon} = 1.60 \times 1.25 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Each watermelon was sold for **$2.00**.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years.

---

### Step 1: Find Dora's current age

We are told:

> Dora will turn **12 in 3 years**.

So, **Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old**.

---

### Step 2: Find James's current age

We are told:

> James is now **twice as old as his sister Dora**.

Since Dora is **9**, James is:

$$
2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find out when James was born

James is **18 years old now**.

We are told:

> John had a son James when he was 19.

So, James was born when John was **19 years old**.

Therefore, **James is 18 years old now**, which means **John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old**.

---

### Step 4: Find the age of John's youngest son

We are told:

> John's youngest son was born when John was **32**.

So, the youngest son was born when John was **32**, and now John is **37**, so the youngest son is:

$$
37 - 32 = 5 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### Step 5: Find how old the youngest son will be in 3 years

$$
5 + 3 = 8 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**John's youngest son will be 8 years old in 3 years.**
We are told:

- Ana takes **3 minutes** to peel one orange.
- Jane takes **4 minutes** to peel one orange.
- They start at the same time and work for **1 hour = 60 minutes**.

We need to find:  
**How many more oranges will Ana have peeled than Jane after 60 minutes?**

---

### Step 1: Find how many oranges each can peel in 60 minutes

#### For Ana:
- Time per orange = 3 minutes
- Number of oranges = Total time ÷ Time per orange  
  $$
  \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  $$

#### For Jane:
- Time per orange = 4 minutes
- Number of oranges = Total time ÷ Time per orange  
  $$
  \frac{60}{4} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Find the difference

$$
20 - 15 = 5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after 1 hour.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Cost of the new radiator**:  
   The original price is $400.

2. **Discount at the junk shop**:  
   He gets it for **80% off**, which means he pays **20% of the original price**.  
   $$
   20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 32
   $$  
   So, he pays **$32** for the radiator.

3. **Mechanic's labor cost**:  
   The mechanic charges **$50 per hour**, and the job takes **3 hours**.  
   $$
   50 \times 3 = 150
   $$  
   So, the labor cost is **$150**.

4. **Total cost**:  
   Add the cost of the radiator and the labor:  
   $$
   32 + 150 = 182
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$182**
We are told:

- Farmer Brown has **20 animals**, all either **chickens** or **cows**.
- The total number of **legs** is **70**.
- We need to find how many of the animals are **chickens**.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ c $ = number of **chickens**
- $ w $ = number of **cows**

We know:
$$
c + w = 20 \quad \text{(total number of animals)}
$$
$$
2c + 4w = 70 \quad \text{(total number of legs: chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs)}
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve the system of equations

From the first equation:
$$
c = 20 - w
$$

Substitute into the second equation:
$$
2(20 - w) + 4w = 70
$$
$$
40 - 2w + 4w = 70
$$
$$
40 + 2w = 70
$$
$$
2w = 30
$$
$$
w = 15
$$

Now substitute back to find $ c $:
$$
c = 20 - w = 20 - 15 = 5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

There are **5 chickens** on the farm.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of pizza slices

- There are **7 pizzas**.
- Each pizza is cut into **8 slices**.

So, total number of slices =  
$$
7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### Step 2: Number of people sharing the pizzas

- Henry and **3 friends**, so that’s  
$$
1 + 3 = 4 \text{ people}
$$

---

### Step 3: Divide the slices equally among the 4 people

$$
\frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Each of them can have **14 slices**.
