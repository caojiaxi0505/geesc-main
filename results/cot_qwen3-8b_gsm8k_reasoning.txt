Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total eggs laid per day**:  
   Janet’s ducks lay **16 eggs per day**.

2. **Eggs used for breakfast**:  
   She eats **3 eggs** every morning for breakfast.

3. **Eggs used for muffins**:  
   She bakes muffins using **4 eggs** every day.

4. **Total eggs used per day**:  
   $ 3 + 4 = 7 $ eggs

5. **Eggs remaining for sale**:  
   $ 16 - 7 = 9 $ eggs

6. **Revenue from selling eggs**:  
   Each egg is sold for **$2**, so:  
   $ 9 \times 2 = \$18 $

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Janet makes \$18 every day at the farmers' market.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Blue fiber needed**:  
   The robe takes **2 bolts** of blue fiber.

2. **White fiber needed**:  
   It takes **half that much** white fiber.  
   Since half of 2 is **1**, the robe takes **1 bolt** of white fiber.

3. **Total bolts needed**:  
   Add the blue and white fiber together:  
   $ 2 + 1 = 3 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **3 bolts** in total.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much **profit** Josh made.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Cost**
Josh buys the house for:

$$
\$80,000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Repair Cost**
He spends an additional:

$$
\$50,000
$$

So, his **total cost** is:

$$
\$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000
$$

---

### **Step 3: Increase in Value**
The repairs caused the value of the house to increase by **150%**.

This means the **value increased by 150% of the original value**.

But we need to be careful — does this 150% increase apply to the **original value** or the **total cost**?

In real estate flipping, typically, the **increase in value** refers to the **original value** of the house before any improvements. So we assume the **original value** was \$80,000.

So, the **increase in value** is:

$$
150\% \text{ of } \$80,000 = 1.5 \times 80,000 = \$120,000
$$

---

### **Step 4: Final Value of the House**
Original value: \$80,000  
Increase: \$120,000  
Final value:

$$
\$80,000 + \$120,000 = \$200,000
$$

---

### **Step 5: Profit Calculation**
Profit = Final Value – Total Cost

$$
\$200,000 - \$130,000 = \$70,000
$$

---

### ✅ **Answer: Josh made a profit of \$70,000.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **James runs 3 sprints each time** he trains.
2. **He trains 3 times a week**.
3. **Each sprint is 60 meters long**.

### Step 1: Meters per training session  
James runs 3 sprints per session, and each sprint is 60 meters:

$$
3 \text{ sprints} \times 60 \text{ meters} = 180 \text{ meters per session}
$$

### Step 2: Total meters per week  
He trains 3 times a week:

$$
180 \text{ meters/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 540 \text{ meters/week}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**James runs 540 meters a week.**
We are told:

- Wendi feeds **each chicken** **3 cups of feed per day**, in **three separate meals**.
- She has a **flock of 20 chickens**.
- In the **morning**, she gives **15 cups** of feed.
- In the **afternoon**, she gives **25 cups** of feed.
- We need to find how many cups of feed she needs to give in the **final meal** (evening) of the day.

---

### Step 1: Total daily feed required for all chickens

Each chicken gets **3 cups per day**, and there are **20 chickens**:

$$
\text{Total daily feed} = 3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### Step 2: Feed given in the morning and afternoon

She gives:

- Morning: **15 cups**
- Afternoon: **25 cups**

So total feed given so far:

$$
15 + 25 = 40 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### Step 3: Feed needed for the final meal

To find out how much feed is left for the final meal:

$$
\text{Final meal feed} = \text{Total daily feed} - \text{Feed already given}
$$
$$
= 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{20} \text{ cups}
$$

Wendi needs to give **20 cups of feed** in the final meal of the day.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Given:
- **Price of one glass** = $5  
- **Every second glass costs 60% of the price**, which means it costs:  
  $$
  0.6 \times 5 = 3 \text{ dollars}
  $$

So, the pattern is:
- **First glass**: $5  
- **Second glass**: $3  
- **Third glass**: $5  
- **Fourth glass**: $3  
- and so on...

This alternates between $5 and $3 for each glass.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many glasses cost $5 and how many cost $3

Kylar wants to buy **16 glasses**.

Since the pattern alternates every two glasses, we can divide 16 by 2:

- **Number of pairs of glasses** = 16 ÷ 2 = 8  
- Each pair consists of one $5 glass and one $3 glass  
- So, there are **8 glasses at $5** and **8 glasses at $3**

---

### Step 2: Calculate total cost

$$
\text{Total cost} = (8 \times 5) + (8 \times 3)
$$
$$
= 40 + 24 = 64
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Kylar needs to pay $64** for 16 glasses.
We are given:

- Seattle has **20** sheep.
- Charleston has **4 times** as many sheep as Seattle.
- Toulouse has **twice as many** sheep as Charleston.

Let's solve step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of sheep in Charleston

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle:

$$
\text{Charleston} = 4 \times \text{Seattle} = 4 \times 20 = 80
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the number of sheep in Toulouse

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston:

$$
\text{Toulouse} = 2 \times \text{Charleston} = 2 \times 80 = 160
$$

---

### Step 3: Add up all the sheep

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Toulouse} + \text{Charleston} + \text{Seattle} = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{260}
$$
Let's break this problem down step by step to find out **how long it takes Carla to download the 200 GB file**, considering the restart.

---

### **Step 1: Total size of the file**
- The file is **200 GB** in total.

---

### **Step 2: Download speed normally**
- Carla can download at **2 GB per minute**.

So, without any interruptions, the time to download the entire file would be:

$$
\frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 100 \text{ minutes}
$$

But there's a **restart** that happens **40% of the way through** the download.

---

### **Step 3: Determine when the restart occurs**

40% of the file is:

$$
0.4 \times 200 = 80 \text{ GB}
$$

So the restart happens after **80 GB** has been downloaded.

---

### **Step 4: Time taken to download the first 80 GB**

At 2 GB per minute:

$$
\frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
$$

Then, Windows forces a **20-minute restart**.

So far, total time is:

$$
40 \text{ minutes (download)} + 20 \text{ minutes (restart)} = 60 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Restarting the download from the beginning**

After the restart, Carla has to **start over** and download the full 200 GB again.

So she downloads the **entire 200 GB** again, which takes:

$$
\frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 100 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 6: Total time to download the file**

Now we add up all the time:

- First 80 GB: 40 minutes  
- Restart: 20 minutes  
- Full download again: 100 minutes  

$$
\text{Total time} = 40 + 20 + 100 = \boxed{160 \text{ minutes}}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
It takes **160 minutes** to download the 200 GB file.
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how far John drove before turning around**

John drives for **3 hours** at a speed of **60 mph**:

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
$$

So, he is **180 miles away from home** when he turns around.

---

### **Step 2: Analyze his return trip (4 hours total)**

He now tries to get back home in **4 hours**, but the journey isn't smooth. Let's look at the breakdown of the return trip:

- **First 2 hours**: Standstill traffic → **distance = 0**
- **Next 0.5 hours (30 minutes)**: Drives at **30 mph**
  
  $$
  \text{Distance} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 15 \, \text{miles}
  $$

- **Remaining time**: He has already spent 2 + 0.5 = **2.5 hours**, so the remaining time is:

  $$
  4 - 2.5 = 1.5 \, \text{hours}
  $$

  During this time, he drives at **80 mph**:

  $$
  \text{Distance} = 80 \, \text{mph} \times 1.5 \, \text{hours} = 120 \, \text{miles}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Total distance covered on return trip**

Add up all the distances he traveled on the way back:

- 0 miles (standstill)
- 15 miles (at 30 mph)
- 120 miles (at 80 mph)

$$
\text{Total return distance} = 0 + 15 + 120 = 135 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Determine how far he is from home at the end of the 4 hours**

He was originally **180 miles away** from home, and he managed to drive **135 miles back**.

$$
\text{Distance from home} = 180 - 135 = \boxed{45 \, \text{miles}}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**John is 45 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.**
Let's break this down step by step to find Eliza's total earnings for the week.

---

### **Step 1: Determine regular hours and overtime hours**

- Eliza worked **45 hours** this week.
- The first **40 hours** are considered **regular hours**.
- The remaining **45 - 40 = 5 hours** are considered **overtime hours**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate regular pay**

- Regular hourly rate = $10
- Regular hours = 40

$$
\text{Regular Pay} = 40 \times 10 = \$400
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate overtime pay**

- Overtime rate = 1.2 × regular hourly rate = $1.2 \times 10 = \$12$
- Overtime hours = 5

$$
\text{Overtime Pay} = 5 \times 12 = \$60
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add regular and overtime pay**

$$
\text{Total Earnings} = \$400 + \$60 = \boxed{\$460}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Eliza's earnings for the week are \$460.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Month 1:**
- Downloads = **60**

---

### **Month 2:**
- Downloads = **3 times** the first month  
  $$
  3 \times 60 = 180
  $$

---

### **Month 3:**
- Downloads are **reduced by 30%** from Month 2.  
  So, it's **70% of the Month 2 downloads**:
  $$
  0.70 \times 180 = 126
  $$

---

### **Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
$$
60 + 180 + 126 = 366
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{366}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step to find the **total cost** of all the pastries Toula bought.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of each type of pastry

#### 1. Donuts
- Quantity: 3 dozen  
- Cost per dozen: $68  
- Total cost for donuts = $ 3 \times 68 $

$$
3 \times 68 = 204
$$

#### 2. Mini cupcakes
- Quantity: 2 dozen  
- Cost per dozen: $80  
- Total cost for mini cupcakes = $ 2 \times 80 $

$$
2 \times 80 = 160
$$

#### 3. Mini cheesecakes
- Quantity: 6 dozen  
- Cost per dozen: $55  
- Total cost for mini cheesecakes = $ 6 \times 55 $

$$
6 \times 55 = 330
$$

---

### Step 2: Add up all the costs

$$
\text{Total cost} = 204 + 160 + 330
$$

$$
204 + 160 = 364  
364 + 330 = 694
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The total cost is $694.**
Let's break this down step by step to figure out **how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money** on his lemon tree.

---

### **1. Initial Cost:**
- **Cost to plant the tree:** $90

---

### **2. Annual Income and Expenses:**

Each year, the tree:
- **Grows 7 lemons**
- **Sells each lemon for $1.50**
- **Costs $3 per year to water and feed**

So, let’s calculate **net profit per year**:

#### **Annual Revenue:**
$$
7 \text{ lemons} \times \$1.50 = \$10.50
$$

#### **Annual Cost:**
$$
\$3
$$

#### **Net Profit per Year:**
$$
\$10.50 - \$3 = \$7.50
$$

---

### **3. Break-even Point:**

Carlos wants to know **when he starts making a profit**, i.e., when the **total revenue from selling lemons exceeds the initial cost of planting the tree**.

Let’s define:
- Let **x** be the number of years.
- Total income after x years = $10.50 × x
- Total cost = $90 (initial) + $3 × x (annual costs)

We want to find the smallest **x** such that:

$$
\text{Total Income} > \text{Total Cost}
$$

$$
10.50x > 90 + 3x
$$

Subtract $3x$ from both sides:

$$
7.50x > 90
$$

Now divide both sides by 7.50:

$$
x > \frac{90}{7.50}
$$

$$
x > 12
$$

---

### ✅ **Answer:**

Carlos will start earning money **after 12 years**.

---

### 📌 Final Answer:
**12 years**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the unknown

Let **x** be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

---

### Step 2: Break down the sales

- She sold **a third** of her vacuum cleaners at the green house:

  $$
  \frac{1}{3}x
  $$

- Then she sold **2 more** to the red house:

  $$
  2
  $$

- Then she sold **half of what was left** at the orange house.

So, after selling to the green and red houses, the number of vacuum cleaners left is:

$$
x - \left(\frac{1}{3}x + 2\right) = x - \frac{1}{3}x - 2 = \frac{2}{3}x - 2
$$

Then she sold **half of that** at the orange house:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right)
$$

After that, she had **5 vacuum cleaners left**.

---

### Step 3: Set up the equation

So, the number of vacuum cleaners left after all the sales is:

$$
\left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) = 5
$$

Simplify the left side:

Let’s call the expression $ A = \frac{2}{3}x - 2 $

Then we have:

$$
A - \frac{1}{2}A = \frac{1}{2}A = 5
$$

So:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) = 5
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
\frac{2}{3}x - 2 = 10
$$

Add 2 to both sides:

$$
\frac{2}{3}x = 12
$$

Now multiply both sides by $ \frac{3}{2} $:

$$
x = 12 \times \frac{3}{2} = 18
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of students
There are **20 students** in the dance class.

---

### Step 2: Students who enrolled in contemporary dance
- 20% of 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance.
- $ 20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 $ students

So, **4 students** enrolled in contemporary dance.

---

### Step 3: Remaining students after contemporary
- Total students = 20  
- Contemporary dancers = 4  
- Remaining students = $ 20 - 4 = 16 $

---

### Step 4: Students who enrolled in jazz dance
- 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz.
- $ 25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4 $ students

So, **4 students** enrolled in jazz dance.

---

### Step 5: Remaining students (enrolled in hip-hop)
- Total students = 20  
- Contemporary = 4  
- Jazz = 4  
- Remaining = $ 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 $

So, **12 students** enrolled in hip-hop dance.

---

### Step 6: Percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop
$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**60%** of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

  - Initial investment = $5,000
  - Market increase = 2.5% per month

- **Option B (Electronic gadgets):**
  - Initial investment = $8,000
  - Market increase = 1.2% per month

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the profit for each option**

#### **Option A: Jewelry**

  $$
  \text{Profit} = 5,000 \times 0.025 = 125
  $$

#### **Option B: Electronic gadgets**

- Increase in value = 1.2% of $8,000  
  $$
  \text{Profit} = 8,000 \times 0.012 = 96
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Compare profits**

- Profit from jewelry = **$125**
- Profit from electronic gadgets = **$96**

---

### **Step 4: Choose the better option**

Since the merchant wants to **maximize profit**, he should choose the option with the **higher profit**.

✅ **Maximum profit = $125**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The maximum profit the merchant can make is $125.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
We are told that **two trains** leave San Rafael at the same time and:

- Travel **westward** for **80 miles**.
- The next day, they travel **northward** for **150 miles**.

We are asked to find the **total distance covered by each train in the two days**.

---

### Step 2: Analyze the movement of each train

Each train:
- Travels **80 miles west** on the first day.
- Travels **150 miles north** on the second day.

So, the total distance covered by each train is simply the sum of these two distances.

$$
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance west} + \text{Distance north}
$$

$$
\text{Total distance} = 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Each train covers a total distance of **230 miles** over the two days.

$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jill's annual salary is $57,500.**
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many eggs Claire uses per day
Claire makes a **3-egg omelet every morning**.

So, she uses **3 eggs per day**.

---

### Step 2: Find out how many days are in 4 weeks
There are **7 days in a week**, so in 4 weeks:

$$
4 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 28 \text{ days}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs used in 4 weeks
She uses 3 eggs per day for 28 days:

$$
3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 28 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ eggs}
$$

---

### Step 4: Convert the total number of eggs to dozens
There are **12 eggs in a dozen**, so:

$$
\frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozen}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Claire will eat 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the total trail and distance covered so far**

- Total trail length = **12 miles**
- Distance covered in first part = **4 miles**
- Distance covered in second part = **2 miles**
- Remaining distance =  
  $$
  12 - (4 + 2) = 6 \text{ miles}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate time spent so far**

- Time for first 4 miles = **1 hour**
- Time for next 2 miles = **1 hour**
- Total time so far =  
  $$
  1 + 1 = 2 \text{ hours}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Determine how much time she can afford to spend on the remaining 6 miles**

She wants her **average speed** to be **4 miles per hour** over the **entire 12-mile trail**.

To find the **total time** she can take to complete the entire trail at an average speed of 4 mph:

$$
\text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

She has already used **2 hours**, so the time she has left to walk the remaining 6 miles is:

$$
3 - 2 = 1 \text{ hour}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Find the required speed for the remaining 6 miles**

She has **1 hour** to walk **6 miles**. So her required speed is:

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{6}{1} = 6 \text{ miles per hour}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{6} \text{ miles per hour}
$$
We are given:

- **10 liters of orange drink**, which is **two-thirds water**.
- **15 liters of pineapple drink**, which is **three-fifths water**.
- While pouring, **1 liter of orange drink is spilled**.
- After this, the total volume becomes **24 liters** (since 10 + 15 = 25, and 1 liter was spilled).
- We need to find: **how much water is in the remaining 24 liters?**

---

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in each original drink

#### Orange Drink:
- Total volume = 10 liters
- Water content = $ \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 $ liters

#### Pineapple Drink:
- Total volume = 15 liters
- Water content = $ \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 $ liters

---

### Step 2: Account for the spill

- 1 liter of **orange drink** is spilled.
- That means we only add **9 liters of orange drink** to the pineapple drink.

So the total volume after spill is:

$$
9 \text{ liters (orange)} + 15 \text{ liters (pineapple)} = 24 \text{ liters}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water in the final mixture

- Water from **orange drink**: $ \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 $ liters
- Water from **pineapple drink**: 9 liters

Total water in the final 24 liters:

$$
6 + 9 = 15 \text{ liters}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{15} \text{ liters of water}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the relationships
- **Raymond and Samantha are cousins.**
- **Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.**
- **Raymond had a son at the age of 23.**
- **Samantha is now 31 years old.**

We are asked: **How many years ago was Raymond's son born?**

---

### Step 2: Find Raymond’s current age

Since **Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha**, and **Samantha is 31**, then:

$$
\text{Raymond's age} = 31 + 6 = 37
$$

So, **Raymond is currently 37 years old**.

---

### Step 3: Find when Raymond had his son

Raymond had a son at the age of **23**. So, the son was born:

$$
37 - 23 = 14 \text{ years ago}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{14}
$$

**Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.**
Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Billy has 8 customers on Tuesday.**

2. **First 3 customers buy 1 DVD each:**
   - $ 3 \text{ customers} \times 1 \text{ DVD/customer} = 3 \text{ DVDs} $

3. **Next 2 customers buy 2 DVDs each:**
   - $ 2 \text{ customers} \times 2 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 4 \text{ DVDs} $

4. **Last 3 customers don't buy any DVDs:**
   - $ 3 \text{ customers} \times 0 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 0 \text{ DVDs} $

5. **Add them all up:**
   - $ 3 + 4 + 0 = 7 $

### ✅ **Answer: Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Determine how long the candle burns:**
   - The candle burns from **1:00 PM to 5:00 PM**.
   - That is a total of **5 hours**.

2. **Determine how much the candle melts per hour:**
   - The candle melts **2 centimeters every hour**.

3. **Calculate the total amount melted:**
   - In 5 hours, the candle will melt:
     $$
     5 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ cm/hour} = 10 \text{ cm}
     $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
The candle will be **10 centimeters shorter** after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
We are told that Kyle bought a book for **$19.50**, which is **25% off** the original price. That means the **$19.50** is **75%** of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let’s call the original price **P**.

So:

$$
0.75 \times P = 19.50
$$

To find **P**, divide both sides by 0.75:

$$
P = \frac{19.50}{0.75}
$$

Now calculate:

$$
P = 26
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: The original price of the book was **$26**.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Identify the known costs**

- **Chicken meal**: $12  
- **Milk (5 packs)**: $3 each → 5 × $3 = **$15**  
- **Apples (4 apples)**: $1.50 each → 4 × $1.50 = **$6**  
- **Pizza boxes**: Each box costs **$8.50**, and we need to find how many boxes Marie ordered.

---

### **Step 2: Add up the known costs**

$$
\text{Total of known items} = 12 + 15 + 6 = 33
$$

---

### **Step 3: Subtract from total paid to find cost of pizza**

Marie paid a total of **$50**, so:

$$
\text{Cost of pizza} = 50 - 33 = 17
$$

---

### **Step 4: Find number of pizza boxes**

Each box costs **$8.50**, so:

$$
\text{Number of pizza boxes} = \frac{17}{8.50}
$$

Now, divide:

$$
\frac{17}{8.50} = 2
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find the cost of each type of clothing

- **Shorts:**  
  Mishka bought **3 pairs** of shorts.  
  Each pair costs **$16.50**.  
  So, total cost for shorts =  
  $$
  3 \times 16.50 = 49.50
  $$

- **Pants:**  
  Mishka bought **3 pairs** of pants.  
  Each pair costs **$22.50**.  
  So, total cost for pants =  
  $$
  3 \times 22.50 = 67.50
  $$

- **Shoes:**  
  Mishka bought **3 pairs** of shoes.  
  Each pair costs **$42**.  
  So, total cost for shoes =  
  $$
  3 \times 42 = 126
  $$

---

### Step 2: Add up all the costs

$$
\text{Total cost} = 49.50 + 67.50 + 126
$$

First, add 49.50 and 67.50:

$$
49.50 + 67.50 = 117
$$

Now add that to 126:

$$
117 + 126 = 243
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{243}
$$

Mishka spent **$243** on all the clothing items.
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **How many servings does Cynthia eat in 60 days?**
She eats **1 serving per night**, so in 60 days:
$$
60 \text{ servings}
$$

### 2. **How many cartons does she need?**
Each carton has **15 servings**.

To find how many cartons she needs:
$$
\frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings per carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
$$

### 3. **How much does each carton cost?**
Each carton costs **$4.00**.

So, total cost for 4 cartons is:
$$
4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00 \text{ per carton} = \$16.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$16.00}
$$
Let's break the problem down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the total trip
Henry's **total trip** is **60 miles**.

### Step 2: First stop
He made his **first stop after traveling 20 miles**.  
So, he traveled **20 miles** before his first stop.

### Step 3: Second stop
His **second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip**.  
That means from his second stop to the end of the trip is **15 miles**.

So, the distance from the **start of the trip** to the **second stop** is:

$$
\text{Total trip} - \text{Distance from second stop to end} = 60 - 15 = 45 \text{ miles}
$$

### Step 4: Distance between first and second stops
Now we know:
- He traveled **20 miles** to the first stop.
- He traveled **45 miles** to the second stop.

So, the distance between the **first stop** and the **second stop** is:

$$
45 - 20 = 25 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**25 miles** were traveled between his first and second stops.
We are given the following information:

- Gloria is choosing between **boots** and **two pairs of high heels**.
- The **total cost of the two pairs of high heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots**.
- One pair of heels costs **$33**.
- The other pair of heels costs **twice as much as the first one**.

---

### Step 1: Find the total cost of the two pairs of heels

- First pair of heels = $33
- Second pair of heels = 2 × $33 = **$66**
- Total cost of heels = $33 + $66 = **$99**

---

### Step 2: Use the relationship between the heels and the boots

We're told that the **total cost of the heels is $5 less than the cost of the boots**.

So, if the boots cost **B**, then:

$$
B - 5 = \text{cost of heels} = 99
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for B

$$
B = 99 + 5 = 104
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{104}
$$

The boots cost **$104**.
We are given:

- The ratio of **Darrell's age to Allen's age** is **7:11**
- Their **total age now is 162**
- We need to find **Allen's age 10 years from now**

---

### Step 1: Represent their ages using the ratio

Let’s assume:

- Darrell's age = $ 7x $
- Allen's age = $ 11x $

Where $ x $ is a common multiplier.

---

### Step 2: Use the total age to solve for $ x $

$$
7x + 11x = 162
$$
$$
18x = 162
$$
$$
x = \frac{162}{18} = 9
$$

---

### Step 3: Find Allen's current age

$$
\text{Allen's age} = 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99
$$

---

### Step 4: Find Allen's age 10 years from now

$$
99 + 10 = 109
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Allen's age 10 years from now is 109.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Define the first guess
The first friend guesses **80** jelly beans.

### Step 2: Second friend's guess
The second friend says **20 more than half the first one**.

- Half of 80 is:  
  $$
  \frac{80}{2} = 40
  $$

- Add 20 to that:  
  $$
  40 + 20 = 60
  $$

So, the second guess is **60**.

### Step 3: Third friend's guess
The third friend says **25% more than the first one**.

- 25% of 80 is:  
  $$
  0.25 \times 80 = 20
  $$

- Add that to 80:  
  $$
  80 + 20 = 100
  $$

So, the third guess is **100**.

### Step 4: Find the average of the three guesses
Now we find the average of the three guesses: 80, 60, and 100.

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{80}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of dogs:** 10  
2. **Time per dog per day:** 0.5 hours  
3. **Days in a week:** 7  

### Step 1: Calculate daily time spent
Each dog takes 0.5 hours per day, so for 10 dogs:
$$
10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
$$

### Step 2: Calculate weekly time spent
Multiply the daily time by the number of days in a week:
$$
5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.**
We are given:

- Gretchen has **110 coins** in total.
- There are **30 more gold coins than silver coins**.

Let’s define:

- Let the number of **silver coins** be $ S $.
- Then the number of **gold coins** is $ S + 30 $ (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver).

Now, we know the total number of coins is 110:

$$
S + (S + 30) = 110
$$

Simplify:

$$
2S + 30 = 110
$$

Subtract 30 from both sides:

$$
2S = 80
$$

Divide by 2:

$$
S = 40
$$

So, the number of **silver coins** is 40.

Then the number of **gold coins** is:

$$
S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **70 gold coins**.
Let's solve this step by step.

We are given:

1. **Raymond has 40 jewels.**
2. **Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.**
3. **Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.**

---

### Step 1: Find how many jewels Aaron has

Raymond has **40** jewels.

Half of Raymond's jewels is:
$$
\frac{40}{2} = 20
$$

Aaron has **5 more** than that:
$$
20 + 5 = 25
$$

So, **Aaron has 25 jewels**.

---

### Step 2: Find how many jewels Siobhan has

Siobhan has **2 fewer** jewels than Aaron:
$$
25 - 2 = 23
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{23}
$$

Siobhan has **23 jewels**.
Let's break the problem down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Points scored in the first 20 minutes  
Mike scores **4 points** in the first 20 minutes.

---

### Step 2: Points scored in the second 20 minutes  
In the second 20 minutes, he scores **25% more** points than in the first 20 minutes.

So, we calculate 25% of 4:

$$
25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
$$

Now add that to the original 4 points:

$$
4 + 1 = 5 \text{ points}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total points scored  
Add the points from both halves:

$$
4 \text{ (first 20 min)} + 5 \text{ (second 20 min)} = 9 \text{ total points}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{9}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.
Terry eats **2 yogurts per day**.

So in 30 days:
$$
2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine the cost per yogurt.
The yogurts are on sale at **4 yogurts for $5.00**.

So the price per yogurt is:
$$
\frac{\$5.00}{4 \text{ yogurts}} = \$1.25 \text{ per yogurt}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate total cost for 60 yogurts.
$$
60 \text{ yogurts} \times \$1.25/\text{yogurt} = \$75.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$75.00}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate total money from selling lego sets**

John has **13 lego sets**, and he sells each for **$15**.

$$
\text{Total money from lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = \$195
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate cost of video games**

He buys **8 video games**, each costing **$20**.

$$
\text{Total cost of video games} = 8 \times 20 = \$160
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate remaining money**

He ends up with **$5 left** after buying the video games. So, the total money he had was:

$$
\text{Total money} = \text{Money spent on games} + \text{Money left} = 160 + 5 = \$165
$$

Wait! That’s a contradiction — earlier we calculated that he made **$195** from selling lego sets, but now we're saying he only used **$165** of it. That means he **still has some money left**, not that he sold all his lego sets.

But the question says:

> "John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games."

So this implies he **sold all his lego sets** (13 of them), and used the money to buy 8 video games and still had $5 left.

So our first calculation is correct:

- He sold **13 lego sets** → earned **$195**
- He spent **$160** on video games
- He has **$5 left**

That adds up correctly:
$$
195 - 160 = 35 \quad \text{(but the problem says he has $5 left)}
$$

Wait — there's a discrepancy here. Let's double-check the math again.

---

### **Rechecking the math:**

He sells **13 lego sets at $15 each**:

$$
13 \times 15 = 195
$$

He buys **8 video games at $20 each**:

$$
8 \times 20 = 160
$$

Then he has **$5 left**.

So total money he had is:

$$
160 + 5 = 165
$$

But he earned **$195** from selling lego sets, so he has:

$$
195 - 165 = 30 \quad \text{left unaccounted for}
$$

This suggests something is wrong in the interpretation.

---

### **Let’s re-read the question carefully:**

> "John plans to sell all his toys and use the money to buy video games. He has 13 lego sets and he sells them for $15 each. He ends up buying 8 video games for $20 each and has $5 left. How many lego sets does he still have?"

Ah! The key is: **"he plans to sell all his toys"**, but **he doesn't necessarily do so**.

So the question is asking: **How many lego sets does he still have?**

So he **did not sell all of them**.

Let’s define variables:

Let $ x $ be the number of lego sets he **still has**.

Then he sold $ 13 - x $ lego sets.

Each lego set sells for $15, so total money from selling:

$$
(13 - x) \times 15
$$

He uses that money to buy **8 video games at $20 each**, and has **$5 left**.

So:

$$
(13 - x) \times 15 = 8 \times 20 + 5
$$

Now solve:

$$
(13 - x) \times 15 = 160 + 5 = 165
$$

$$
13 - x = \frac{165}{15} = 11
$$

$$
x = 13 - 11 = 2
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{2}
$$

**John still has 2 lego sets.**
Let's break this down step by step to find **how fast John runs**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the total distance
John runs **60 miles per week**.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many days he runs
He runs **3 days a week**.

---

### Step 3: Find out how much time he spends running each day

- **First day**: He runs for **3 hours**.
- **Other two days**: He runs **half as much** as the first day.

So, on each of the other two days, he runs:

$$
\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total time spent running in a week

$$
3 \text{ hours (first day)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (second day)} + 1.5 \text{ hours (third day)} = 6 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 5: Find his average speed

We know:
- **Total distance** = 60 miles
- **Total time** = 6 hours

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour.**
We are given the following information:

- Dana can **skip** at a rate of **3 miles per hour**.
- She can **run** at a speed that is **four times faster** than she can walk.
- She can **skip** at a speed that is **half as fast** as she can run.
- She spends **one-third of the time running** and **two-thirds of the time walking**.
- We need to find how many **miles** she can travel in **6 hours**.

---

### Step 1: Determine her running speed

We know:
- Skip speed = 3 mph
- Skip speed = ½ × Run speed  
→ So, Run speed = 2 × Skip speed = 2 × 3 = **6 mph**

---

### Step 2: Determine her walking speed

She can run 4 times faster than she can walk. That means:

- Run speed = 4 × Walk speed  
→ Walk speed = Run speed ÷ 4 = 6 ÷ 4 = **1.5 mph**

---

### Step 3: Determine how much time she spends running and walking

Total time = 6 hours  
- Running time = (1/3) × 6 = **2 hours**  
- Walking time = (2/3) × 6 = **4 hours**

---

### Step 4: Calculate distance traveled

- Distance = Speed × Time  
→ Running distance = 6 mph × 2 hours = **12 miles**  
→ Walking distance = 1.5 mph × 4 hours = **6 miles**

---

### Step 5: Total distance

Total distance = Running distance + Walking distance  
= 12 miles + 6 miles = **18 miles**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Dana can travel 18 miles in 6 hours.**
Let's break this down step by step.

We are given:

1. **Suzy’s iPhone is 1 year old.**
2. **Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone.**
3. **Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.**

---

### Step 1: Find the age of Ben's iPhone

"Two times older than" means **twice as old**.

So:
$$
\text{Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Suzy's iPhone}
$$
$$
\text{Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the age of Brandon's iPhone

Brandon's iPhone is **four times as old** as Ben's iPhone.

$$
\text{Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Ben's iPhone}
$$
$$
\text{Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{8}
$$

Brandon’s iPhone is **8 years old**.
We are given the following information:

- The **dragon's fire reaches up to 1000 feet**.
- **Polly can throw the gold javelin 400 feet** without holding the gemstone.
- When **holding the gemstone**, she can throw it **three times farther** than without it.

---

### Step 1: Determine the distance Polly can throw with the gemstone

If Polly throws 400 feet without the gemstone, then with the gemstone, she can throw:

$$
3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how far outside the dragon’s reach she can stand

The dragon’s fire reaches **1000 feet**, so if Polly stands **more than 1000 feet away**, the dragon will not be able to burn her. But she still needs to throw the javelin **at least 1000 feet** to hit the dragon.

So, the question is:  
> If Polly can throw **1200 feet** when holding the gemstone, how far **outside** of the dragon's reach (i.e., beyond 1000 feet) can she stand and still hit the dragon?

That means she can stand **up to 1200 feet away** from the dragon and still hit it. So the **maximum distance** she can stand **outside** the dragon's reach and still hit it is:

$$
1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{200} \text{ feet}
$$

Polly can stand **200 feet outside** the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin while holding the sapphire gemstone.
Let's break this problem down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Total number of pie pieces**
Grandma baked **5 pies**, and each pie was cut into **8 pieces**.

So, the total number of pieces is:

$$
5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Pieces remaining at the end**
At the end of the evening, there were **14 pieces left**.

---

### **Step 3: Pieces taken by guests**
To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces:

$$
40 \text{ (total pieces)} - 14 \text{ (remaining pieces)} = 26 \text{ pieces taken}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{26}
$$

**26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests.**
Let's solve this step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Find the total calories in the bag of chips**

- The bag has **5 servings**.
- Each serving has **250 calories**.

$$
\text{Total calories in the bag} = 5 \times 250 = 1250 \text{ calories}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many calories you can still consume today**

- Your **daily calorie target** is **2000 calories**.
- You've already consumed **1800 calories**.

$$
\text{Remaining calories} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find out how many grams of chips you can eat without exceeding your remaining calorie limit**

- The bag has **300g** and **1250 calories**, so the **calories per gram** is:

$$
\text{Calories per gram} = \frac{1250}{300} \approx 4.17 \text{ calories per gram}
$$

- Now, divide the **remaining calories** by the **calories per gram** to find how many grams you can eat:

$$
\text{Grams you can eat} = \frac{200}{4.17} \approx 48 \text{ grams}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
You can eat approximately **48 grams** of chips without exceeding your daily calorie target.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find Charlie's **net profit** when he makes and sells 20 candles.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how much beeswax is needed for 20 candles**

- For every **1 pound of beeswax**, Charlie can make **10 tapered candles**.
- So, to make **20 candles**, he needs:

$$
\frac{20}{10} = 2 \text{ pounds of beeswax}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total cost of supplies**

- It costs **$10.00** for **1 pound of beeswax and the wicks**.
- So, for **2 pounds of beeswax and wicks**, the total cost is:

$$
2 \times \$10.00 = \$20.00
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total revenue from selling 20 candles**

- He sells each candle for **$2.00**.
- So, for **20 candles**, the total revenue is:

$$
20 \times \$2.00 = \$40.00
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate net profit**

$$
\text{Net Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$20.00}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the number of articles written each day**

- **Monday**:  
  She wrote **5 articles**.

- **Tuesday**:  
  She wrote **2/5 times more articles than on Monday**.  
  So, we calculate:
  $$
  \text{Additional articles} = \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
  $$
  Therefore, total articles on Tuesday:
  $$
  5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  $$

- **Wednesday**:  
  She wrote **twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday**.
  $$
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total number of articles**

$$
\text{Total articles} = 5 \text{ (Monday)} + 7 \text{ (Tuesday)} + 14 \text{ (Wednesday)} = 26 \text{ articles}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total time spent**

Each article takes **4 hours** to research and write.

$$
\text{Total time} = 26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{104} \text{ hours}
$$
Let's break this problem down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the initial amount
Candice **started with 80 post-it notes** in her purse.

---

### Step 2: She buys a package of post-it notes
She buys **a package of post-it notes**, and we need to find out how many were in that package. Let’s call this number **x**.

So, after buying the package, she has:
$$
80 + x \text{ post-it notes}
$$

---

### Step 3: She uses some post-it notes at work
At work, she places **one post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee**. So she uses:
$$
220 \text{ post-it notes}
$$

---

### Step 4: She has 23 post-it notes left
After using 220 post-it notes, she has **23 post-it notes remaining**.

So we can write the equation:
$$
(80 + x) - 220 = 23
$$

---

### Step 5: Solve for x
$$
80 + x - 220 = 23 \\
x - 140 = 23 \\
x = 23 + 140 \\
x = 163
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{163}
$$

So, the package she purchased had **163 post-it notes**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Determine how many blue ties John bought**

We are told:

- Blue ties cost **$40 each**.
- John spent **$200** on blue ties.

So, the number of blue ties he bought is:

$$
\text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Price per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many red ties John bought**

We're told:

- John buys **twice as many red ties as blue ties**.

So, if he bought **5 blue ties**, then he bought:

$$
\text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine the price of a red tie**

We’re told:

- Red ties cost **50% more than blue ties**.

Since blue ties cost **$40**, then:

$$
\text{Price of red tie} = 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate total amount spent on red ties**

He bought **10 red ties** at **$60 each**:

$$
\text{Total spent on red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
$$

---

### **Step 5: Calculate total amount spent on all ties**

$$
\text{Total spent on all ties} = \text{Spent on blue ties} + \text{Spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = \boxed{800}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $800**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Convert the length of the wire from feet to inches
We know:
- 1 foot = 12 inches  
So,  
**4 feet = 4 × 12 = 48 inches**

### Step 2: Determine how many 6-inch pieces can be cut from 48 inches
We divide the total length by the length of each piece:

$$
\frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches per piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Tracy obtained 8 pieces.**
Let's break the problem down step by step:

### Step 1: Total number of units in the building
- The building has **15 floors**.
- Each floor has **8 units**.

So, total number of units =  
$$
15 \times 8 = 120 \text{ units}
$$

---

### Step 2: Number of occupied units
- **3/4** of the building is occupied.

So, number of occupied units =  
$$
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ units}
$$

---

### Step 3: Number of unoccupied units
To find the unoccupied units, subtract the occupied units from the total:

$$
120 - 90 = 30 \text{ units}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{30}
$$

There are **30 unoccupied units** in the building.
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Find the number of eggs produced per week
Lloyd produces **252 eggs per day**.

So in one week (7 days), he produces:
$$
252 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 1764 \text{ eggs}
$$

---

### Step 2: Convert eggs to dozens
There are **12 eggs in a dozen**, so we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find how many dozens he sells:

$$
\frac{1764}{12} = 147 \text{ dozen}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate weekly earnings
He sells each dozen for **$2**. So his weekly earnings are:

$$
147 \text{ dozen} \times \$2/\text{dozen} = \$294
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Lloyd makes $294 per week on eggs.**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how far Tom traveled from 1 PM to 4 PM**

- Tom sailed from **1 PM to 4 PM**, which is a total of:
  $$
  4 - 1 = 3 \text{ hours}
  $$

- His speed was **10 miles per hour**, so the distance he traveled is:
  $$
  \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how long it takes him to return**

- He now travels back at **6 mph**.
- The distance is the same: **30 miles**.
- Time = Distance ÷ Speed:
  $$
  \text{Time} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{6 \, \text{mph}} = 5 \, \text{hours}
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{5 \text{ hours}}
$$

It takes Tom **5 hours** to get back.
We are told that:

- Uriah needs to **remove 15 pounds** from his book bag.
- Each **comic book** weighs **1/4 pound**.
- Each **toy** weighs **1/2 pound**.
- He removes **30 comic books**.

We are asked: **How many toys does he need to remove?**

---

### Step 1: Calculate the weight of the removed comic books

Each comic book = $ \frac{1}{4} $ pound  
He removes 30 comic books:

$$
\text{Weight of comic books} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 2: Subtract the weight of comic books from the total weight to remove

Total weight to remove = 15 pounds  
Weight of comic books removed = 7.5 pounds

$$
\text{Remaining weight to remove} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine how many toys are needed to remove the remaining 7.5 pounds

Each toy = $ \frac{1}{2} $ pound  
Let the number of toys be $ x $

$$
x \times \frac{1}{2} = 7.5
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
x = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Uriah needs to remove 15 toys.**
We are given the following information:

- **Rate per truck tire repair:** $60  
- **Rate per car tire repair:** $40  
- **Thursday:**
  - 6 truck tires repaired
  - 4 car tires repaired
- **Friday:**
  - 12 car tires repaired
  - 0 truck tires repaired

---

### Step 1: Calculate revenue for Thursday

$$
\text{Revenue on Thursday} = (6 \times 60) + (4 \times 40)
= 360 + 160 = \$520
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate revenue for Friday

$$
\text{Revenue on Friday} = (12 \times 40) + (0 \times 60)
= 480 + 0 = \$480
$$

---

### Step 3: Compare revenues and find the difference

$$
\text{Difference} = 520 - 480 = \$40
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$40}
$$

The mechanic earned **\$40 more** on Thursday than on Friday.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the information given
- The **Doubtfire sisters** are driving home with **7 kittens** they adopted.
- Their **mother** calls and says:
  - **Patchy**, the first cat, has had **three times** the number of adopted kittens.
  - **Trixie**, the other cat, has had **12 kittens**.

We are to find out how many **kittens the Doubtfire family now has** in total.

---

### Step 2: Determine the number of kittens from Patchy

We are told that **Patchy has had three times the number of adopted kittens**.  
The **adopted kittens** are the 7 kittens that the sisters are driving home with.

So, the number of kittens from Patchy is:

$$
3 \times 7 = 21
$$

---

### Step 3: Add up all the kittens

Now we add:
- The **7 adopted kittens** (that the sisters are bringing home)
- The **21 kittens from Patchy**
- The **12 kittens from Trixie**

$$
7 + 21 + 12 = 40
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{40}
$$

The Doubtfire family now has **40 kittens** in total.
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Start with the total number of lollipops:**
   Jean has **30 lollipops**.

2. **Jean eats 2 lollipops:**
   $$
   30 - 2 = 28
   $$
   So, Jean now has **28 lollipops** left.

3. **Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in one bag:**
   To find out how many bags Jean can fill, divide the remaining lollipops by the number per bag:
   $$
   \frac{28}{2} = 14
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**14 bags** can be filled.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the total cost for one movie visit
Peter buys:
- A movie ticket for **$7**

So, the total cost for one movie visit is:
$$
7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
$$

### Step 2: Determine how many times he can go to the movies with $42
Now we divide his total money by the cost per movie visit:
$$
\frac{42}{14} = 3
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Peter can go to the movies **3 times**.
We are given the following information:

- **Bridge weight limit:** 5000 pounds  
- **Weight of each box:** 15 pounds  
- **Combined weight of driver and empty truck:** 3755 pounds  

We are asked to find the **maximum number of boxes** that can be loaded onto the truck **without exceeding** the bridge's weight limit.

---

### Step 1: Determine how much additional weight the truck can carry

The total weight the bridge can support is **5000 pounds**.  
The **driver and empty truck** together weigh **3755 pounds**.

So, the remaining weight capacity for the **boxes** is:

$$
5000 - 3755 = 1245 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many boxes can be loaded

Each box weighs **15 pounds**, so we divide the available weight capacity by the weight per box:

$$
\frac{1245}{15} = 83
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{83}
$$

So, the **maximum number of boxes** that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is **83**.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find the **final price** of Stephen's groceries after all the fees and charges.

---

### 1. **Original Bill**
Stephen's original grocery bill is:

$$
\$40.00
$$

---

### 2. **Delivery Vendor Fee (25%)**
The delivery vendor added a **25% fee** on the **original total** of \$40.00.

$$
\text{Delivery Fee} = 0.25 \times 40.00 = \$10.00
$$

So, after adding this fee, the total becomes:

$$
40.00 + 10.00 = \$50.00
$$

---

### 3. **Delivery Fees (Fixed Charge)**
In addition to the 25% fee, there was a **fixed delivery charge** of:

$$
\$3.00
$$

Now the total becomes:

$$
50.00 + 3.00 = \$53.00
$$

---

### 4. **Tip**
Stephen added a **\$4.00 tip**.

So, final total is:

$$
53.00 + 4.00 = \$57.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$57.00}
$$

This is the **final price** of Stephen's groceries after all the fees and tip.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Clusters of fruit**:  
   There are 6 clusters, and each cluster has **20 fruit**.  
   So the total number of fruit in the clusters is:  
   $$
   6 \times 20 = 120
   $$

2. **Scattered fruit**:  
   There are **67 individual fruit** scattered across the bush.

3. **Total number of raspberries**:  
   Add the fruit from the clusters and the scattered fruit:  
   $$
   120 + 67 = 187
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **187 raspberries** in total.
We are given the following information about a basket of 25 oranges:

- **Total oranges = 25**
- **1 is bad**
- **20% are unripe**
- **2 are sour**
- The rest are **good**

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of unripe oranges

20% of 25 oranges are unripe:

$$
\text{Unripe oranges} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
$$

So, **5 oranges are unripe**.

---

### Step 2: List all categories we know

We now have:

- **Bad oranges**: 1  
- **Unripe oranges**: 5  
- **Sour oranges**: 2  

These are distinct categories (bad, unripe, sour), so we can add them up to find how many oranges are **not good**.

$$
\text{Not good} = 1 + 5 + 2 = 8
$$

---

### Step 3: Subtract from total to find the number of good oranges

$$
\text{Good oranges} = \text{Total} - \text{Not good} = 25 - 8 = 17
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{17}
$$

There are **17 good oranges** in the basket.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Cost of materials**:  
   Janet pays **$500** for the materials.

2. **Cost of construction**:  
   She pays an additional **$800** for the jeweler to construct the brooch.

3. **Total cost before insurance**:  
   $$
   500 + 800 = 1300
   $$

4. **Insurance cost (10% of total cost)**:  
   $$
   10\% \text{ of } 1300 = 0.10 \times 1300 = 130
   $$

5. **Total amount paid**:  
   $$
   1300 + 130 = 1430
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$1,430**
Let's break this down step by step to determine **Marcy's annual pension** if she quits after **30 years** of working for the company.

---

### Step 1: Understand the Pension Rules

From the problem:

- If Marcy works **40 years**, she gets an **annual pension of $50,000/year**.
- Starting **after 20 years**, she becomes entitled to **5% of the value of the pension per year**.
- She **quits after 30 years**.

We need to determine what her **annual pension** will be if she quits after 30 years.

---

### Step 2: Interpret the "5% of the value of the pension per year"

This is a bit ambiguous, but based on standard pension structures, it likely means:

> After 20 years, she becomes eligible for **a percentage of the final pension amount** (not a percentage of time worked or salary).

So, the rule is:

- For the **first 20 years**, she earns **no pension**.
- After **20 years**, she becomes entitled to **5% of the value of the pension** per year.

But this wording is confusing. Let’s consider two possible interpretations and see which makes sense.

---

## 🔍 **Interpretation 1: She receives 5% of the final pension amount each year starting at age 60**

This is a common structure in defined benefit pensions. It could mean:

- If she works **40 years**, she gets **$50,000/year**.
- If she works **only 30 years**, then she would get **5% of $50,000 = $2,500/year**.

But that seems too low, and doesn't match the phrasing "starting after 20 years."

---

## 🔍 **Interpretation 2: She receives 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years**

That is, once she has worked **20 years**, she becomes entitled to **5% of the full pension** per year.

So, if she works **40 years**, she gets **$50,000/year**.

If she works **30 years**, she gets **5% of $50,000 = $2,500/year**.

But again, that seems like a very small number for a pension.

---

## 🔍 **Interpretation 3: She earns 5% of her **final salary** per year after 20 years**

This is another common pension structure — called a **"defined benefit plan"** where the pension depends on your salary and years of service.

In this case:

- The **full pension** at 40 years is **$50,000/year**.
- That implies that the **pension formula** is:
  
  $$
  \text{Annual Pension} = (\text{Years of Service}) \times (\text{Multiplier}) \times (\text{Final Salary})
  $$

Assuming the multiplier is **$1,250/year per year of service**, then:

$$
\text{Pension} = 40 \times 1,250 = 50,000
$$

So, if she only works **30 years**, her pension would be:

$$
\text{Pension} = 30 \times 1,250 = 37,500
$$

But the question says: “Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year.”

This suggests that **after 20 years**, she gets **5% of the value of the pension** per year.

So we can interpret this as:

- At 40 years, she gets **$50,000/year**
- So, the **value of the pension** at 40 years is **$50,000**
- Therefore, **5% of that** is **$2,500/year**

So, if she works **30 years**, she gets **5% of the full pension** → **$2,500/year**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\$2,500}
$$

This is the **annual pension** she would receive if she quits after **30 years** of work.
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Understand the time frame:**
- A year has **12 months**.
- The first half of the year = **6 months**.
- The second half of the year = **6 months**.

---

### 2. **Calculate the cost for the first half of the year:**

The streaming service charges **$140 per month** for the first 6 months.

$$
\text{Cost for first 6 months} = 6 \times 140 = 840
$$

---

### 3. **Calculate the cost for the second half of the year:**

In the second half of the year, the price is **10% less** than $140.

First, find **10% of $140**:

$$
10\% \text{ of } 140 = 0.10 \times 140 = 14
$$

So, the new monthly rate is:

$$
140 - 14 = 126
$$

Now, calculate the cost for the next 6 months at $126/month:

$$
\text{Cost for second 6 months} = 6 \times 126 = 756
$$

---

### 4. **Add both halves to get the total amount paid:**

$$
\text{Total amount paid} = 840 + 756 = 1596
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$1596}
$$

Aleena paid **\$1596** for the streaming service by the end of the year.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the information given**

- Sophia has **traveled 100 miles** since her last fill-up.
- She needed to put in **4 gallons** of gas to fill up again.
- Her car’s **gas tank holds 12 gallons**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate her **miles per gallon (MPG)**

She used **4 gallons** of gas to go **100 miles**, so:

$$
\text{MPG} = \frac{\text{Miles driven}}{\text{Gallons used}} = \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ miles per gallon}
$$

So, Sophia's car gets **25 miles per gallon**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how far she can go on a full tank**

Her tank holds **12 gallons**, and she gets **25 miles per gallon**, so:

$$
\text{Distance on full tank} = \text{MPG} \times \text{Tank size} = 25 \times 12 = 300 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Sophia can drive **300 miles** on a single tank of gas.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Number of diamonds
We are told:

- There are **175 diamonds**.

### Step 2: Number of rubies
There are **35 fewer rubies than diamonds**.

So:
$$
\text{Number of rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140
$$

### Step 3: Number of emeralds
There are **twice as many emeralds as rubies**.

So:
$$
\text{Number of emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280
$$

### Step 4: Total number of gems
Now, add up all the gems:

$$
\text{Total gems} = \text{Diamonds} + \text{Rubies} + \text{Emeralds}
$$
$$
= 175 + 140 + 280 = 595
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{595}
$$

There were **595 gems** in the chest.
We are given the following information:

- There are **twice as many boys as girls** at Dr. Wertz's school.
- There are **60 girls**.
- There are **5 students to every teacher**.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of boys

Since there are twice as many boys as girls:

$$
\text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the total number of students

$$
\text{Total students} = \text{Number of boys} + \text{Number of girls} = 120 + 60 = 180
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the number of teachers

There are **5 students per teacher**, so the number of teachers is:

$$
\text{Number of teachers} = \frac{\text{Total students}}{5} = \frac{180}{5} = 36

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{36}
$$
We are told:

- Bailey receives a **weekly allowance of $5** for **8 weeks**.
- At the end of those 8 weeks, she has a total of **$100**.
- We need to find out how much money she **started with**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate total allowance received
She gets $5 per week for 8 weeks:

$$
5 \times 8 = 40
$$

So, she received **$40** in total from her allowance.

---

### Step 2: Subtract allowance from final amount
At the end of 8 weeks, she has **$100**, which includes both the money she started with and the $40 she earned.

Let’s call the amount she **started with** = **x**

Then:

$$
x + 40 = 100
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for x

$$
x = 100 - 40 = 60
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Bailey started with **$60**.

Judy makes **\$7,425** in one week.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **First recipe**:  
   It has **20 instructions**.

2. **Second recipe**:  
   It has **twice as many instructions** as the first one.  
   So, we calculate:  
   $$
   2 \times 20 = 40
   $$

3. **Total instructions for both recipes**:  
   Add the instructions from both recipes:  
   $$
   20 + 40 = 60
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Kelian has to read 60 instructions** to prepare the two dishes.
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the money from brownies
Tommy sells **43 brownies** at **$3 per slice**.

$$
43 \times 3 = 129
$$

So, Tommy raises **$129** from brownies.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the money from cheesecakes
Tommy sells **23 slices of cheesecake** at **$4 per slice**.

$$
23 \times 4 = 92
$$

So, Tommy raises **$92** from cheesecakes.

---

### Step 3: Add both amounts to find total money raised

$$
129 + 92 = 221
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Tommy raises $221.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much **Shiela will pay each month** for 3 months.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones**

Shiela bought **5 cell phones**, each costing **$150**.

$$
\text{Total cost} = 5 \times 150 = \$750
$$

---

### **Step 2: Understand the interest charge**

A **2% interest** is charged **for each unit**. That means:

- For each cell phone, a **2% interest** is added to the price.
- So for one cell phone:  
  $$
  \text{Interest per phone} = 150 \times 0.02 = \$3
  $$

- Total interest for all 5 phones:
  $$
  5 \times 3 = \$15
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Add the interest to the total cost**

$$
\text{Total amount to be paid} = 750 + 15 = \$765
$$

---

### **Step 4: Divide the total amount by the number of months**

She will pay this over **3 months**, so:

$$
\text{Monthly payment} = \frac{765}{3} = \$255
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$255}
$$

Shiela will pay **\$255** each month for 3 months.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the pricing and rounding**

Artie rounds all prices to the **nearest dollar**. So we need to round each flower's price before calculating total revenue.

- **Marigolds**: $2.74 → Rounded to **$3**
- **Petunias**: $1.87 → Rounded to **$2**
- **Begonias**: $2.12 → Rounded to **$2**

---

### **Step 2: Calculate revenue from each type of flower**

Now, multiply the rounded price per pot by the number of pots sold:

- **Marigolds**:  
  $ 12 \text{ pots} \times \$3 = \$36 $

- **Petunias**:  
  $ 9 \text{ pots} \times \$2 = \$18 $

- **Begonias**:  
  $ 17 \text{ pots} \times \$2 = \$34 $

---

### **Step 3: Add up the totals**

$$
\$36 + \$18 + \$34 = \$88
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

**Artie will make \$88 today.**
We are told that each level of a sandcastle has **half the square footage** of the level below it. The **top level (level 4)** has a square footage of **16**.

Let’s work **from the top down**, since we know the top level and each level is half the size of the one below it.

---

### Step 1: Assign square footage to each level

- **Level 4 (top):** 16  
- **Level 3:** Half of Level 4 → $ \frac{16}{2} = 8 $  
- **Level 2:** Half of Level 3 → $ \frac{8}{2} = 4 $  
- **Level 1 (bottom):** Half of Level 2 → $ \frac{4}{2} = 2 $

So the square footages are:

- Level 1: 2  
- Level 2: 4  
- Level 3: 8  
- Level 4: 16

---

### Step 2: Find the average square footage

To find the **average**, add up all the square footages and divide by the number of levels:

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{2 + 4 + 8 + 16}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{7.5}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the feeding schedule**

- For the **first 180 days**, Cecilia feeds the puppy **1 cup per day**.
- After that, for the **rest of its life**, she feeds the puppy **2 cups per day**.

We are asked to find out how many **bags of dog food** Cecilia will use in the **first year** (which is 365 days).

---

### **Step 2: Calculate food needed for the first 180 days**

$$
\text{Food for first 180 days} = 180 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ cup/day} = 180 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate food needed for the remaining days in the first year**

There are:

$$
365 - 180 = 185 \text{ days left in the first year}
$$

She feeds **2 cups per day** during this time:

$$
\text{Food for remaining 185 days} = 185 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ cups/day} = 370 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total food used in the first year**

$$
\text{Total food} = 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### **Step 5: How many bags of dog food does she need?**

Each bag contains **110 cups**.

$$
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{550}{110} = 5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year.**
We are given the following relationships:

1. **Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah**  
2. **Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David**  
3. **Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry**

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Use Sarah's laundry amount
We are told:

> Sarah does **400 pounds** of laundry.

---

### Step 2: Find Raymond's laundry amount

Raymond does **half as much** as Sarah:

$$
\text{Raymond} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sarah} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find David's laundry amount

Sarah does **4 times as much** as David, so:

$$
\text{Sarah} = 4 \times \text{David}
$$

We know Sarah = 400, so:

$$
400 = 4 \times \text{David} \Rightarrow \text{David} = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 4: Calculate the difference between Raymond and David

$$
\text{Difference} = \text{Raymond} - \text{David} = 200 - 100 = \boxed{100} \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{100} \text{ pounds}
$$
We are given two options for buying flowers:

- **Option 1:** Buy **3 flowers for $2.50**
- **Option 2:** Buy **2 flowers for $1**

We want to find out **how much money Vincent saves** by buying **18 flowers at the better price**.

---

### Step 1: Determine which option is cheaper per flower

Let’s calculate the **cost per flower** for each package.

#### Option 1: 3 flowers for $2.50  
$$
\text{Cost per flower} = \frac{2.50}{3} \approx 0.83 \text{ dollars}
$$

#### Option 2: 2 flowers for $1  
$$
\text{Cost per flower} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars}
$$

So, **Option 2 is cheaper per flower**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate total cost for 18 flowers using both options

#### Option 1 (3 for $2.50)
How many packages of 3 flowers does Vincent need for 18 flowers?

$$
\frac{18}{3} = 6 \text{ packages}
$$

Total cost:
$$
6 \times 2.50 = 15.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

#### Option 2 (2 for $1)
How many packages of 2 flowers does Vincent need for 18 flowers?

$$
\frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ packages}
$$

Total cost:
$$
9 \times 1 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the savings

$$
\text{Savings} = 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$6.00}
$$

Vincent saves **\$6.00** by buying 18 flowers at the better price.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Original cost of grooming:** $100  
2. **Discount offered:** 30% off  
3. **Calculate the discount amount:**  
   $$
   30\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.30 \times 100 = 30
   $$  
4. **Subtract the discount from the original price:**  
   $$
   100 - 30 = 70
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$70**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Total amount of water
The total amount of water is:
$$
24 \text{ liters}
$$

### Step 2: Water given to the two girls
Each girl got $ \frac{1}{6} $ of the 24 liters.

So, one girl got:
$$
\frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
$$

Since there are two girls:
$$
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ liters}
$$

### Step 3: Water given to the boy
The boy got:
$$
6 \text{ liters}
$$

### Step 4: Total water given out
$$
8 \text{ liters (to the girls)} + 6 \text{ liters (to the boy)} = 14 \text{ liters}
$$

### Step 5: Water left
$$
24 \text{ liters (total)} - 14 \text{ liters (given out)} = 10 \text{ liters}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{10} \text{ liters}
$$
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Charlie started with 10 stickers.**  
   $$
   \text{Starting stickers} = 10
   $$

2. **He bought 21 stickers from the store.**  
   $$
   10 + 21 = 31
   $$

3. **He got 23 stickers for his birthday.**  
   $$
   31 + 23 = 54
   $$

4. **He gave 9 stickers to his sister.**  
   $$
   54 - 9 = 45
   $$

5. **He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card.**  
   $$
   45 - 28 = 17
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Charlie has 17 stickers left.**
Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Grace's weight** is given as:  
   $$
   125 \text{ pounds}
   $$

2. **Alex's weight** is described as "2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs."

   - First, calculate **4 times Grace's weight**:  
     $$
     4 \times 125 = 500
     $$

   - Then subtract 2 pounds:  
     $$
     500 - 2 = 498
     $$

   So, **Alex weighs 498 pounds**.

3. **Combined weight** of Grace and Alex:  
   $$
   125 + 498 = 623
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
$$
\boxed{623} \text{ pounds}
$$
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Number of rose bushes**: 3  
2. **Roses per rose bush**: 25  
   - So, total number of roses = $ 3 \times 25 = 75 $  
3. **Thorns per rose**: 8  
   - So, total number of thorns = $ 75 \times 8 $

Now calculate:  
$ 75 \times 8 = 600 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **600 thorns** in total.
We are told:

- A football team played **22 games**.
- They **won 8 more games than they lost**.

Let’s define:

- Let the number of **losses** be $ x $.
- Then the number of **wins** is $ x + 8 $ (since they won 8 more than they lost).

### Step 1: Set up an equation

Total games = Wins + Losses  
$$
x + (x + 8) = 22
$$

### Step 2: Simplify the equation

$$
2x + 8 = 22
$$

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

Subtract 8 from both sides:
$$
2x = 14
$$

Divide by 2:
$$
x = 7
$$

So, the number of **losses** is 7.  
Then the number of **wins** is:
$$
x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{15}
$$

They won **15 games**.
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### 1. **Determine the number of years Gene has been vacationing:**

- He started vacationing at age **23**.
- He is now **34** years old.
- So, he has been vacationing for:

$$
34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years}
$$

---

### 2. **How many vacations does he go on each year?**

- He goes on **4 vacations per year**.

---

### 3. **Calculate total number of quilt blocks:**

Each vacation corresponds to **one shirt**, and each shirt is a **quilt block**.

So, total quilt blocks = number of vacations × number of shirts per vacation.

$$
\text{Total quilt blocks} = 11 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ vacations/year} = 44 \text{ quilt blocks}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**44 quilt blocks** in total.
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand what is being asked

We are told that Greg has an **alarm set to ring three times a day**. However, each time the alarm goes off, it **rings multiple times**, and the number of rings (or the duration) changes depending on which time of the day it is.

We are asked:  
> **How many times did the alarm ring in all?**

This means we need to count how many **individual rings** happened during the three alarms.

---

### Step 2: Analyze each alarm

- **First time**: The alarm rang **four times**.
- **Second time**: It rang **three times as long as the first time**.
- **Third time**: It rang **half as long as the second time**.

But wait — the wording is a bit tricky here. Let's clarify:

- "The first time it went off today, it **rang four times**." → So, **4 rings**.
- "The second time it went off, it **rung for three times as long as the first time**." → This refers to **duration**, not number of rings.
- "The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time." → Again, this refers to **duration**, not number of rings.

So, the **number of rings** is only specified for the **first time**.

We are **not given the number of rings** for the second or third time. Only the **duration** of the ringing is described.

---

### Step 3: Determine if we can answer the question

We are asked:

> How many times did the alarm ring in all?

If we only know how many times the **first alarm** rang (4 times), but **no information about the number of rings** for the other two alarms, then we **cannot determine** the total number of rings.

However, let's double-check the original wording again carefully:

> "Greg has an alarm set to ring three times a day as a reminder. When the alarm goes off, it continues to ring until Greg turns it off."

So, the alarm is **set to ring three times a day**, meaning it will go off **three times**, and each time it goes off, it rings **until turned off**.

But the key phrase is:

> "The first time it went off today, it rang four times."

That means the **first time** the alarm went off, it **rung four times** before Greg turned it off.

Now the rest says:

> "The second time it went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time."
> "The third time, it rang for half as long as the second time."

These refer to **duration**, not number of rings.

So, unless we are told how many rings occurred during the second and third alarms, we **cannot calculate the total number of rings**.

---

### Final Answer:

Since we are **not given** the number of rings for the second and third alarms, we **cannot determine** the total number of rings.

✅ **Answer: Cannot be determined from the given information.**
Let's break this down step by step to find Sylvie's **annual salary after three more years of service**, given the company's policy.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the initial salary and the policy**

- **Initial monthly salary**: $600
- **Annual salary** = Monthly salary × 12  
  So, initial **annual salary** = $600 × 12 = **$7,200 per year**

- **Policy**: Employees who have stayed for **5 years or more** get a **10% increase in their initial salary every year**.

So, once an employee has been with the company for **5 years**, they receive a **10% annual raise on their original salary**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine when the raises start**

- Sylvie just completed her **5th year** of service **last December**.
- That means she is now eligible for the **10% annual raise starting from the next year** (i.e., the year after her 5th year).

So, the **first raise will occur in the year following her 5th year**, which is **this year** (assuming we're calculating it right after her 5th year).

---

### **Step 3: Calculate her salary after 3 more years**

We are asked to find her **annual salary after three more years of service**.

This means we need to calculate her salary **after 3 annual raises** (each at 10%).

Let’s define:

- Initial annual salary = $7,200
- Annual raise rate = 10% = 0.10

We'll apply the 10% raise **three times**.

---

### **Step 4: Apply the raises**

#### Year 1 (after 1st raise):
$$
\text{Salary} = 7,200 \times 1.10 = 7,920
$$

#### Year 2 (after 2nd raise):
$$
\text{Salary} = 7,920 \times 1.10 = 8,712
$$

#### Year 3 (after 3rd raise):
$$
\text{Salary} = 8,712 \times 1.10 = 9,583.20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service is:**

$$
\boxed{\$9,583.20}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the variables

Let:
- $ H $ = number of copies Harald sold
- $ M $ = number of copies Marilyn sold

We are told:

> Marilyn's first record sold **10 times as many copies** as Harald's.

So:
$$
M = 10H
$$

Also, we are told:

> They sold a total of **88,000 copies combined**.

So:
$$
M + H = 88,000
$$

---

### Step 2: Substitute the expression for $ M $

Since $ M = 10H $, substitute into the second equation:

$$
10H + H = 88,000
$$

$$
11H = 88,000
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ H $

$$
H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Harald sold 8,000 copies.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Determine the number of guests who will actually attend**

Christina invited **16 friends**, but **1/4 of the attendees don't show up**.

So, the number of people who **don't show up** is:
$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4
$$

Therefore, the number of people who **do show up** is:
$$
16 - 4 = 12
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how many gift bags are needed**

Christina needs **0.75 gift bags per guest**.

So, for **12 guests**, she needs:
$$
0.75 \times 12 = 9 \text{ gift bags}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total cost**

Each gift bag costs **$2**, so the total cost is:
$$
9 \times 2 = \$18
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$18}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how much potato salad one child eats
- An **adult** eats **10 lbs** of potato salad.
- A **child** eats **half as much** as an adult.

$$
\text{Child's portion} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ lbs}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total potato salad needed for adults
There are **20 adults**, and each eats **10 lbs**:

$$
20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ lbs}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total potato salad needed for children
There are **5 children**, and each eats **5 lbs**:

$$
5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ lbs}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add the totals to find how much Ted needs to bring

$$
200 \text{ lbs (for adults)} + 25 \text{ lbs (for children)} = 225 \text{ lbs}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad.**
We are given the following information:

1. **Cindy has 4 pets.**
2. **Marcia has two more pets than Cindy.**
3. **Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia.**

Let's solve step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find how many pets Marcia has

Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy.

$$
\text{Marcia's pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many pets Jan has

Jan has 3 times the number of pets as Marcia.

$$
\text{Jan's pets} = 3 \times \text{Marcia's pets} = 3 \times 6 = 18
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the total number of pets

Now, add up the number of pets each person has:

$$
\text{Total pets} = \text{Cindy's pets} + \text{Marcia's pets} + \text{Jan's pets}
$$
$$
= 4 + 6 + 18 = 28
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{28}
$$
We are given the following information:

- Emily has 4 kids: **Amy**, **Jackson**, **Corey**, and **James**.
- **Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.**
- **Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.**
- **James is 10 years old.**
- **James is 1 year younger than Corey.**

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Use the information about James and Corey

We're told:

- **James is 10 years old.**
- **James is 1 year younger than Corey.**

So, we can write:

$$
\text{Corey} = \text{James} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11
$$

✅ So, **Corey is 11 years old**.

---

### Step 2: Use the information about Amy and Corey

We're told:

- **Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.**

So,

$$
\text{Amy} = \text{Corey} - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9
$$

✅ So, **Amy is 9 years old**.

---

### Step 3: Use the information about Amy and Jackson

We're told:

- **Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.**

So,

$$
\text{Amy} = \text{Jackson} + 5
$$

We already found that **Amy is 9**, so:

$$
9 = \text{Jackson} + 5
$$

Subtract 5 from both sides:

$$
\text{Jackson} = 9 - 5 = 4
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Jackson is 4 years old.**
We are given:

- Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles **2 seconds faster** than Gerald.
- After Gerald improved his diet, his speed increased by **10%**, meaning he ran **faster**.
- Now, **Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds**.
- We are asked: **How fast can Gerald (with his improved diet) run the 400-meter hurdles?**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let’s say:

- Let $ G $ = Gerald's original time (in seconds) for the 400-meter hurdles
- Then Lee's original time was $ G - 2 $

But now, **Gerald has improved his speed by 10%**, which means he now runs the same distance **faster**. That is, his **new time** is less than his original time.

So we need to find Gerald’s **new time** after a 10% improvement in **speed**.

---

### Step 2: Understand the relationship between speed and time

Speed is inversely proportional to time for a fixed distance.

So if Gerald improves his speed by 10%, that means his new speed is:

$$
\text{New speed} = \text{Original speed} \times 1.10
$$

Since speed is inversely proportional to time, this means his **new time** is:

$$
\text{New time} = \frac{\text{Original time}}{1.10}
$$

So:

$$
\text{Gerald's new time} = \frac{G}{1.10}
$$

---

### Step 3: Use Lee’s current time

We are told that **now Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds**.

But we don’t know how much time Lee used to run it. However, we do know that **Lee used to be 2 seconds faster than Gerald**.

So:

$$
\text{Lee's original time} = G - 2
$$

Now, **Lee runs it in 38 seconds**, but we don't know whether that's his **original time** or his **current time**.

Wait — the problem says:

> "Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run the 400-meter hurdles."

So this is referring to their **original times** before Gerald improved his diet.

Then it says:

> "But Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. If Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds..."

This implies that **Lee's current time is 38 seconds**, and we are to find Gerald’s **current time** (after his improvement).

So we must assume that **Lee’s current time is 38 seconds**, and that **this is the same as his original time**, since no mention of Lee improving his speed is made.

So:

$$
\text{Lee's original time} = 38 \text{ seconds}
$$

And since Lee used to be 2 seconds faster than Gerald:

$$
\text{Gerald's original time} = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find Gerald's new time

Gerald improved his speed by 10%, so his **new time** is:

$$
\text{New time} = \frac{40}{1.10} = \frac{40}{1.1}
$$

$$
\text{New time} = \frac{400}{11} \approx 36.36 \text{ seconds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{36.36} \text{ seconds}
$$

So, **Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in approximately 36.36 seconds.**
Let's break this problem down step by step.

### Given:

1. **Number of dogs = 60**
2. **There are two cats for every dog** → So the number of **cats = 2 × number of dogs**
3. **Number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats**
4. We are to find the **total number of pets** in the neighborhood (dogs + cats + rabbits)

---

### Step 1: Find the number of cats

$$
\text{Cats} = 2 \times \text{Dogs} = 2 \times 60 = 120
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the number of rabbits

The number of **rabbits** is **twelve less than the combined number of dogs and cats**:

$$
\text{Rabbits} = (\text{Dogs} + \text{Cats}) - 12 = (60 + 120) - 12 = 180 - 12 = 168
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the total number of pets

$$
\text{Total pets} = \text{Dogs} + \text{Cats} + \text{Rabbits} = 60 + 120 + 168 = 348
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{348}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of students
We are told there are **200 Grade 5 students**.

### Step 2: Find the number of boys
We are told that **2/5** of the students are boys.

$$
\text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80
$$

### Step 3: Find the number of girls
Total students = 200  
Number of boys = 80  
So, number of girls is:

$$
\text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
$$

### Step 4: Find how many girls are in the girl scout
We are told that **2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout**.

$$
\text{Girls in girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80
$$

### Step 5: Find how many girls are **not** in the girl scout
$$
\text{Girls not in girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{40}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Harry's sleep time:**  
   Harry slept **9 hours**.

2. **James's sleep time:**  
   James slept **2/3** of what Harry slept.  
   So we calculate:  
   $$
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ hours}
   $$

3. **Difference in sleep time:**  
   To find how many more hours Harry slept than James, subtract James's sleep time from Harry's:  
   $$
   9 - 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Harry slept 3 more hours than James.**
We are told:

- Freda uses **16-ounce cans of tomatoes**.
- Each can contains **3 tomatoes**.
- When she cooks the tomatoes into sauce, they **lose half their volume**.
- Her last batch made **32 ounces of sauce**.

We need to find: **How many tomatoes did Freda use?**

---

### Step 1: Understand the volume loss

When Freda cooks the tomatoes into sauce, they **lose half their volume**. That means the **final volume of sauce is half the original volume of the tomatoes** used.

So:

$$
\text{Volume of sauce} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Original volume of tomatoes}
$$

Let’s denote the original volume of tomatoes as $ V $. Then:

$$
\frac{1}{2}V = 32 \Rightarrow V = 64 \text{ ounces}
$$

Freda used **64 ounces of tomatoes** in total.

---

### Step 2: Find how many cans of tomatoes that is

Each can is **16 ounces**, so:

$$
\text{Number of cans} = \frac{64}{16} = 4 \text{ cans}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find how many tomatoes that is

Each can has **3 tomatoes**, so:

$$
\text{Total number of tomatoes} = 4 \times 3 = 12
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{12}
$$

Freda used **12 tomatoes**.
We are given the following information:

- **Originally, there were 30 cars** on the motorway.
- Some of the cars **drive through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes**.
- Then, **20 more cars drive through** in the **remaining 15 minutes**.
- **5 cars take an exit**, so they **do not** have to drive through the traffic jam.
- We are asked: **How many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?**

---

### Step-by-step reasoning:

Let’s define:

- Let $ x $ be the number of cars that drove through the **first 15 minutes**.
- Then, **20 more cars** drove through in the **next 15 minutes**.
- So, the total number of cars that **did drive through** the traffic jam is:
  $$
  x + 20
  $$
- However, **5 cars took an exit**, meaning those 5 did **not** go through the jam.

So, the total number of cars that **originally** were on the motorway is equal to the number of cars that **drove through** the jam plus the number that **took an exit**.

That is:
$$
\text{Total cars} = \text{Cars that drove through} + \text{Cars that took an exit}
$$

Substitute known values:
$$
30 = (x + 20) + 5
$$

Solve for $ x $:
$$
30 = x + 25
$$
$$
x = 5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### 1. **Plants Mary already has:**
Mary has **2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges**.

So, total number of plants she already has is:
$$
2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants}
$$

---

### 2. **New plants received:**
She received **18 new potted plants** from the nursery.

So, total number of plants she now has is:
$$
80 \text{ (existing)} + 18 \text{ (new)} = 98 \text{ plants}
$$

---

### 3. **Plants to be given away:**
She will give **1 plant from each ledge** to friends and family.

Since there are **40 ledges**, she will give away:
$$
1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants}
$$

---

### 4. **Plants remaining after giving away:**
$$
98 \text{ (total plants)} - 40 \text{ (given away)} = 58 \text{ plants}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{58}
$$

Mary will remain with **58 potted plants**.
Let's break this down step by step to find the total number of doorbell rings.

---

### Step 1: Understand the information

We are told:

- **First friend** pressed the doorbell **20 times**.
- **Second friend** pressed **1/4 times more** than the first friend.
- **Third friend** pressed **10 times more** than the **fourth friend**.
- **Fourth friend** pressed the doorbell **60 times**.

We are asked to find the **total number of doorbell rings** made by all four friends.

---

### Step 2: Calculate each friend's doorbell presses

#### First friend:
$$
\text{First} = 20 \text{ presses}
$$

#### Second friend:
The second friend pressed **1/4 times more** than the first friend.  
That means the second friend pressed:
$$
20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ presses}
$$

#### Fourth friend:
$$
\text{Fourth} = 60 \text{ presses}
$$

#### Third friend:
The third friend pressed **10 times more** than the fourth friend:
$$
\text{Third} = 10 \times 60 = 600 \text{ presses}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add up all the presses

$$
\text{Total} = \text{First} + \text{Second} + \text{Third} + \text{Fourth}
$$
$$
= 20 + 25 + 600 + 60 = 695
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{695}
$$

So, the doorbell rang **695 times** in total.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find the total number of pages Solo needs to read**

He has to read:

- 4 pages from Science  
- 20 pages from Social Studies  
- 7 pages from History  
- 8 pages from Geography  

Add them all together:

$$
4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 \text{ pages}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Subtract the pages he already read**

Solo read **15 pages on Monday**, so the remaining pages are:

$$
39 - 15 = 24 \text{ pages left}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine how many days he has left**

He has **4 more days** to complete his reading.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the average number of pages per day**

To find the average number of pages he needs to read each day, divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

$$
\frac{24}{4} = 6
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day for the next 4 days.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: How many glasses of water does John drink **each day**?

- He drinks **1 glass of water** with **breakfast**, **lunch**, **dinner**, and **before bed**.
- That’s **4 glasses per day**.

### Step 2: How many days does he do this?

- He does this **every weekday** (Monday to Friday) — that’s **5 days**.
- On **weekends** (Saturday and Sunday), he **does not** drink water with dinner — he has soda instead. So on weekends, he still drinks **3 glasses of water** (breakfast, lunch, and before bed).

### Step 3: Calculate total glasses of water per week

#### Weekdays (5 days):
- 4 glasses/day × 5 days = **20 glasses**

#### Weekends (2 days):
- 3 glasses/day × 2 days = **6 glasses**

### Step 4: Add them together

- 20 (weekdays) + 6 (weekends) = **26 glasses**

### ✅ Final Answer:
**John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week.**
We are given:

- The fog bank takes **10 minutes** to cover **3 miles** of the city.
- The city is **42 miles** wide from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.

We want to find out how many **minutes** it will take for the fog bank to cover the **entire 42-mile** city.

---

### Step 1: Determine the rate of fog coverage

The fog covers **3 miles in 10 minutes**, so the rate is:

$$
\text{Rate} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per mile}
$$

This means it takes **10/3 minutes** to cover **1 mile**.

---

### Step 2: Multiply by total distance

To find the time to cover **42 miles**, multiply the rate by the distance:

$$
\text{Time} = \left( \frac{10}{3} \right) \times 42 = \frac{420}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{140} \text{ minutes}
$$

So, it will take **140 minutes** for the fog bank to cover the entire city.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of pieces
Poppy is solving a **1000-piece** jigsaw puzzle.

---

### Step 2: Poppy places a quarter of the pieces
A quarter of 1000 is:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250
$$

So, **250 pieces** are placed by Poppy.

---

### Step 3: Remaining pieces after Poppy places hers
$$
1000 - 250 = 750
$$

So, **750 pieces** are left after Poppy.

---

### Step 4: Her mom places a third of the remaining pieces
Her mom places a third of the **remaining 750 pieces**:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250
$$

So, **250 more pieces** are placed by her mom.

---

### Step 5: Total pieces placed so far
$$
250 + 250 = 500
$$

---

### Step 6: Pieces left to be placed
$$
1000 - 500 = 500
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{500}
$$

**500 jigsaw pieces are left to be placed.**
Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Amir eats 5 cookies.**

2. **Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir.**  
   So, Cody eats:  
   $ 3 \times 5 = 15 $ cookies.

3. **To find how many cookies both of them eat together,** we add the number of cookies Amir and Cody each eat:  
   $ 5 + 15 = 20 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **20 cookies**
We are given:

- John has **3 boxes**.
- Each box is **5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches** (outer dimensions).
- The **walls are 1 inch thick**.
- We need to find the **total inner volume** of all 3 boxes.

---

### Step 1: Understand the dimensions

Each box has **outer dimensions**:  
Length = 5 in  
Width = 6 in  
Height = 4 in  

But since the walls are **1 inch thick**, the **inner dimensions** will be smaller by **2 inches in each dimension** (1 inch on each side).

So, subtract 2 inches from each dimension to get the **inner dimensions**:

- Inner length = 5 - 2 = **3 inches**
- Inner width = 6 - 2 = **4 inches**
- Inner height = 4 - 2 = **2 inches**

---

### Step 2: Calculate the inner volume of one box

$$
\text{Inner volume of one box} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
= 3 \times 4 \times 2 = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
$$

---

### Step 3: Multiply by 3 for all 3 boxes

$$
\text{Total inner volume} = 3 \times 24 = \boxed{72} \text{ cubic inches}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{72} \text{ cubic inches}
$$
We are told that Frankie watched a total of **7 hours** of TV over the week. We need to find out how many **30-minute episodes** he watched on **Wednesday**.

---

### Step 1: Break down what Frankie watched each day

#### Monday and Tuesday:
- Each day: 1-hour episode
- Total for both days:  
  $ 1 \text{ hour/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ hours} $

#### Wednesday:
- Watched **a few episodes** of a **30-minute show**
- Let’s call the number of 30-minute episodes = **x**
- So, time spent on Wednesday = $ x \times 0.5 $ hours

#### Thursday:
- Watched **1-hour episode** and **1 30-minute episode**
- Time = $ 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 $ hours

#### Friday:
- Watched **2 one-hour episodes**
- Time = $ 2 \times 1 = 2 $ hours

---

### Step 2: Add up all the times

Total time = (Monday + Tuesday) + (Wednesday) + (Thursday) + (Friday)

$$
\text{Total} = 2 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 + 0.5x
$$

We are told that the total time is **7 hours**, so:

$$
5.5 + 0.5x = 7
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for x

$$
0.5x = 7 - 5.5 = 1.5
$$

$$
x = \frac{1.5}{0.5} = 3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Frankie watched **3** 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.
Let's break the problem down step by step and solve it logically.

---

### Step 1: Define a variable
Let’s let:

- $ x $ = the number of cookies Henry baked **last year**

---

### Step 2: Understand what Henry wants to do this year
He **wants to make twice as many** as last year, so he plans to bake:

$$
2x \text{ cookies}
$$

But he **actually bakes 15 more** than that. So the actual number of cookies he bakes is:

$$
2x + 15
$$

---

### Step 3: Account for the dropped cookies
He drops **5 cookies**, so the number of cookies remaining after dropping is:

$$
(2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10
$$

We're told that **after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left**. So we can write the equation:

$$
2x + 10 = 110
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve the equation
$$
2x + 10 = 110 \\
2x = 110 - 10 \\
2x = 100 \\
x = 50
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Henry baked **50 cookies last year**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Price per gallon of gas**: $3.00  
2. **Cashback per gallon**: $0.20  
3. **Number of gallons purchased**: 10 gallons  

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of gas
$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{Price per gallon} \times \text{Number of gallons} = 3.00 \times 10 = \$30.00
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total cashback
$$
\text{Total cashback} = \text{Cashback per gallon} \times \text{Number of gallons} = 0.20 \times 10 = \$2.00
$$

---

### Step 3: Subtract cashback from total cost
$$
\text{Final amount paid} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total cashback} = 30.00 - 2.00 = \$28.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**\$28.00** is what the person would pay after the cashback rewards.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the dimensions
We are told that each **roll-up** is a single unit of fruit roll-up. So, when they say "Beatrice's was two roll-ups wide and 24 rolls up long", it means:

- **Beatrice's total number of roll-ups** = width × length  
  = 2 × 24 = **48 roll-ups**

Similarly for **Marcell**:
- **Marcell's total number of roll-ups** = width × length  
  = 3 × 14 = **42 roll-ups**

### Step 2: Total number of roll-ups eaten
Now we add both amounts:

- Beatrice: 48 roll-ups  
- Marcell: 42 roll-ups  
- **Total** = 48 + 42 = **90 roll-ups**

### Step 3: Average number of roll-ups eaten
To find the **average**, divide the total by the number of people (which is 2):

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{90}{2} = \boxed{45}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **45** roll-ups on average.
We are given the following information:

- **Water intake rate:** The boat takes on **2 liters of water for every 10 feet** Julia rows.
- **Rowing speed:** It takes her **16 seconds to row 20 feet**.
- **Distance to shore:** She needs to row **64 seconds** to reach shore.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many feet Julia rows in 64 seconds

We know:
- In **16 seconds**, she rows **20 feet**  
So, her **speed** is:

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = 1.25 \text{ feet/second}
$$

Now, calculate the total distance she rows in **64 seconds**:

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 1.25 \text{ ft/s} \times 64 \text{ s} = 80 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate how much water the boat took on

The boat takes on **2 liters of water per 10 feet** rowed.

So, for **80 feet**, the amount of water taken on is:

$$
\text{Water taken on} = \left(\frac{2 \text{ liters}}{10 \text{ feet}}\right) \times 80 \text{ feet} = 0.2 \times 80 = 16 \text{ liters}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{16 \text{ liters}}
$$

Julia's boat took on **16 liters of water** by the time she reached shore.
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Determine the number of lessons per day**

- There are **4 teachers**.
- Each teacher has **2 lessons per day**.

So, total number of lessons per day is:

$$
4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons/teacher} = 8 \text{ lessons}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned per lesson**

- The whiteboard is cleaned **3 times per lesson**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total cleanings in a day**

Now, multiply the number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson:

$$
8 \text{ lessons/day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings/day}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{24}
$$

The whiteboard is cleaned **24 times per day**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Ryan plants 2 flowers a day.**  
   So, in one day, he plants 2 flowers.

2. **He does this for 15 days.**  
   So, total number of flowers planted =  
   $$
   2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers}
   $$

3. **However, 5 of the flowers did not grow.**  
   So, we subtract those 5 from the total:  
   $$
   30 - 5 = 25
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **25 flowers** grew in Ryan's garden.
We are given the following information:

1. **Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.**
2. **The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.**
3. **Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.**

We are asked: **How many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo?**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ J $ = number of photos Jamal's phone can hold = 1800
- $ B $ = number of photos Brittany's phone can hold
- $ D $ = number of **ducks** in Jamal's photo (this is what we need to find)

From the first statement:

> Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.

This means:

$$
J = 6B
$$

We know $ J = 1800 $, so:

$$
1800 = 6B \Rightarrow B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
$$

So, Brittany's phone can hold **300** photos.

---

### Step 2: Use the second statement

> The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.

That means:

$$
B = 50D
$$

We found earlier that $ B = 300 $, so:

$$
300 = 50D \Rightarrow D = \frac{300}{50} = 6
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{6}
$$

So, **6 ducks** can be seen in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
Let's break this down step by step to find **Sasha's profit**.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the lumber she bought**

#### 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has **10** of these.
- Each costs **$10**.
- Total cost for these =  
  $$
  10 \times 10 = \$100
  $$

#### 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- She has **5** of these.
- Each costs **$16**.
- Total cost for these =  
  $$
  5 \times 16 = \$80
  $$

#### **Total cost (initial investment):**
$$
\$100 + \$80 = \$180
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine the selling price per board**

We are not told what **Sasha sells them for**, so we need to make an assumption or clarify. Since the problem asks for **profit**, and it says:

> "She has leftovers, she decides to sell them."

But it doesn’t say how much **she sells them for**. So perhaps the question is missing some information? Let’s check again.

Wait — the problem says:

> "prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber."

That suggests that the **selling price** is now **50% higher** than what she paid for them.

So, we can assume that Sasha sells the lumber at **50% above her original cost per board**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the selling price per board**

#### For 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Original cost = **$10** per board
- Selling price =  
  $$
  10 + (10 \times 0.5) = 10 + 5 = \$15
  $$

#### For 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- Original cost = **$16** per board
- Selling price =  
  $$
  16 + (16 \times 0.5) = 16 + 8 = \$24
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate total revenue from selling the lumber**

#### Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
- 10 boards × $15 each =  
  $$
  10 \times 15 = \$150
  $$

#### Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
- 5 boards × $24 each =  
  $$
  5 \times 24 = \$120
  $$

#### **Total revenue:**
$$
\$150 + \$120 = \$270
$$

---

### **Step 5: Calculate profit**

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost}
$$
$$
\text{Profit} = \$270 - \$180 = \boxed{\$90}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Sasha makes a profit of \$90.**
We are told that Katy uses **teaspoons of sugar** and **cups of water** in the ratio **7:13**. She used a **total of 120 units** (teaspoons of sugar + cups of water). We are asked to find how many **teaspoonfuls of sugar** she used.

---

### Step 1: Understand the ratio

The ratio of **sugar : water** is **7:13**, which means:

- For every **7 parts** of sugar, there are **13 parts** of water.
- So, the total number of parts = **7 + 13 = 20 parts**

---

### Step 2: Find the value of one part

She used a total of **120 units** (teaspoons of sugar + cups of water).

So, each "part" is:

$$
\frac{120}{20} = 6 \text{ units}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the amount of sugar

Since sugar is **7 parts**, the amount of sugar is:

$$
7 \times 6 = 42 \text{ teaspoons}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{42}
$$

Katy used **42 teaspoonfuls of sugar**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of children**: 3  
2. **Pairs of shoes per child**: 2  
3. **Cost per pair of shoes**: $60  

### Step 1: Total number of pairs of shoes
Each child gets 2 pairs, so for 3 children:
$$
3 \text{ children} \times 2 \text{ pairs per child} = 6 \text{ pairs}
$$

### Step 2: Total cost
Each pair costs $60, so:
$$
6 \text{ pairs} \times \$60 \text{ per pair} = \$360
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**John paid $360.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the information given**

- On the **first day**, there are **2 containers** of imported vehicles.
- Each container contains **5 vehicles**.
- So, on the first day, the number of vehicles is:

$$
2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles/container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Total number of vehicles after the second day**

It is given that **after the second day**, the total number of vehicles at the port becomes:

$$
30 \text{ vehicles}
$$

So, the number of **additional vehicles** brought in on the second day is:

$$
30 - 10 = 20 \text{ vehicles}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine the number of containers on the second day**

Each container still holds **5 vehicles**. To find out how many containers were brought in on the second day, divide the number of additional vehicles by the number of vehicles per container:

$$
\frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles/container}} = 4 \text{ containers}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{4} \text{ containers}
$$
We are given the following information:

1. **Adrien's total salary was 30% higher than Lylah's** four years ago.
2. **Four years later**, Adrien's salary had increased, and he was earning **40% more than what he was making four years ago**.
3. **Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago.**
4. We are to find the **total salary the two were receiving four years later**.

---

### Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago

We know that:
- Adrien's salary four years ago = $40,000
- Adrien's salary was **30% higher** than Lylah's.

Let’s call Lylah's salary four years ago = $ x $

Then:
$$
\text{Adrien's salary} = x + 0.30x = 1.30x
$$
$$
1.30x = 40,000
$$

Solve for $ x $:
$$
x = \frac{40,000}{1.30} = 30,769.23
$$

So, **Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23**

---

### Step 2: Determine Adrien's salary four years later

We are told that **four years later**, Adrien's salary had increased by **40%** from what it was four years ago.

His salary four years ago = $40,000

So, his salary four years later is:
$$
40,000 + 0.40 \times 40,000 = 40,000 \times 1.40 = 56,000
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine Lylah's salary four years later

The problem does **not** specify how much Lylah's salary increased. However, it says:

> "Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously"

This means that **both salaries increased at the same time**, but we are not given any specific percentage increase for Lylah.

But wait — the question asks for **the total salary the two were receiving four years later**, and we only have Adrien's new salary. So we need to assume something about Lylah's salary change.

Let’s look again carefully:

> "Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago."

So, **only Adrien's salary is given as increasing by 40%**. There is **no mention of Lylah's salary changing**.

Therefore, unless specified otherwise, we must assume that **Lylah's salary remained the same** (or that no information is provided about her increase).

So, we will **assume Lylah's salary did not change** over the four years.

Thus, her salary four years later is still:
$$
\$30,769.23
$$

---

### Step 4: Total salary four years later

Adrien's salary four years later = \$56,000  
Lylah's salary four years later = \$30,769.23

Total salary = 
$$
56,000 + 30,769.23 = \boxed{\$86,769.23}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$86,769.23}
$$
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many sheets Miguel uses per week.
- Miguel uses **2 pads of paper** per week.
- Each pad has **30 sheets**.
  
So, the number of sheets he uses per week is:
$$
2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many weeks are in a month.
- A typical month has about **4 weeks**.

---

### Step 3: Multiply weekly usage by number of weeks in a month.
$$
60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many apples and oranges Morisette brought
- **Apples:** 5  
- **Oranges:** 8  

So, Morisette has **5 + 8 = 13 fruits**.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many apples and oranges Kael brought

- **Apples:** Kael brought **twice** the number of apples that Morisette brought.  
  So, Kael brought:  
  $ 2 \times 5 = 10 $ apples

- **Oranges:** Kael brought **half** the number of oranges that Morisette brought.  
  So, Kael brought:  
  $ \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 $ oranges

So, Kael has **10 + 4 = 14 fruits**.

---

### Step 3: Add both totals to find the total number of fruits

- Morisette: 13 fruits  
- Kael: 14 fruits  

$$
\text{Total} = 13 + 14 = \boxed{27}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **27 fruits** in total.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Monday**
Sadie slept **8 hours** on Monday.

---

### **Step 2: Tuesday and Wednesday**
She slept **2 hours less** than Monday each day for the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday).

So, each of these days:
$$
8 - 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
$$

For both Tuesday and Wednesday:
$$
6 + 6 = 12 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Thursday to Sunday (the rest of the week)**
She slept **1 hour more** than the two days (Tuesday and Wednesday), which were 6 hours each.

So, she slept:
$$
6 + 1 = 7 \text{ hours per day}
$$

There are 5 days from Thursday to Sunday, so:
$$
7 \times 5 = 35 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total Sleep for the Week**

Add up all the hours:

- Monday: 8 hours  
- Tuesday + Wednesday: 12 hours  
- Thursday to Sunday: 35 hours  

$$
8 + 12 + 35 = 55 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{55} \text{ hours}
$$
Let's break this problem down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how far Rosie runs in the first 3 hours
Rosie runs at **10 miles per hour** for the first **3 hours**.

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 30 \, \text{miles}
$$

### Step 2: Determine how much time she has left after the first 3 hours
She runs a total of **7 hours**, so the remaining time is:

$$
7 \, \text{hours} - 3 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours}
$$

### Step 3: Determine how far she runs in the next 4 hours
Now she runs at **5 miles per hour** for the remaining **4 hours**.

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 5 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
$$

### Step 4: Add both distances together
$$
\text{Total distance} = 30 \, \text{miles} + 20 \, \text{miles} = \boxed{50} \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.**
We are given the following information:

- Jennie starts with **60 letters needing stamps**.
- She puts **stamps on one-third** of these letters.
- After stamping, there are **30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters**.
- We are asked: **How many letters were in the already-stamped pile when Jennie began?**

---

### Step 1: Determine how many letters Jennie stamped

She stamps **one-third** of the 60 letters that needed stamps:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \text{ letters}
$$

So, she stamped **20 letters**.

---

### Step 2: Understand what the final number of already-stamped letters means

After stamping, there are **30 letters** in the already-stamped pile.

This includes:
- The **20 letters** she just stamped.
- Plus any letters that were already in the already-stamped pile **before** she started stamping.

Let’s call the number of letters in the already-stamped pile **at the beginning** as $ x $.

Then:

$$
x + 20 = 30
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = 30 - 20 = 10
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{10}
$$

There were **10 letters** in the already-stamped pile when Jennie began.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many spoons were in the package that **Julia bought**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the total number of spoons Julia had at the end

> "When she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons."

So, **after all the actions**, Julia had **12 spoons**.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many spoons were used

> "While Julia was making the stew, she used three of the spoons to sample her stew."

So, **3 spoons were used**.

---

### Step 3: Determine how many spoons her husband gave her

> "Her husband also bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia."

So, **5 spoons were added** from her husband.

---

### Step 4: Let’s define the unknown

Let’s call the number of spoons in the **package that Julia bought** as **x**.

---

### Step 5: Set up an equation

We know:

- Julia started with **x** spoons (from her own purchase)
- Her husband gave her **5** more
- She used **3** spoons
- At the end, she had **12** spoons left

So, we can write the equation:

$$
x + 5 - 3 = 12
$$

Simplify:

$$
x + 2 = 12
$$

Subtract 2 from both sides:

$$
x = 10
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Find the number of fish sausages
Dylan bought **6 more fish sausages** than chicken sausages.

He bought **38 chicken sausages**, so:

$$
\text{Fish sausages} = 38 + 6 = 44
$$

### Step 2: Find the total number of sausages
Now, add the chicken and fish sausages together:

$$
\text{Total sausages} = \text{Chicken sausages} + \text{Fish sausages} = 38 + 44 = 82

Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **We are told that Lily made 50 friends.**

   So,  
   $$
   \text{Lily's friends} = 50
   $$

2. **Amy made 20 more friends than Lily.**

   That means:  
   $$
   \text{Amy's friends} = \text{Lily's friends} + 20 = 50 + 20 = 70
   $$

3. **To find how many friends Lily and Amy have together, we add their number of friends:**

   $$
   \text{Total friends} = \text{Lily's friends} + \text{Amy's friends} = 50 + 70 = 120
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{120}

We are given the following information:

- Each **pepper** costs **$15**.
- A **watermelon** costs **3 times** what a pepper costs.
- An **orange** costs **$5 less** than a watermelon.
- Dillon buys:
  - 4 watermelons
  - 20 peppers
  - 10 oranges

---

### Step 1: Find the cost of one watermelon

Since a watermelon costs 3 times what a pepper costs:

$$
\text{Cost of one watermelon} = 3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the cost of one orange

An orange costs $5 less than a watermelon:

$$
\text{Cost of one orange} = 45 - 5 = 40 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for each item

- Cost of 4 watermelons:
  $$
  4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ dollars}
  $$

- Cost of 20 peppers:
  $$
  20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ dollars}
  $$

- Cost of 10 oranges:
  $$
  10 \times 40 = 400 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### Step 4: Add up all the costs

$$
\text{Total cost} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{880}
$$

Dillon will spend **$880** in total.
Let's break this down step by step to calculate the **profit** the hospital makes from these visits.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of patients per day**
- The hospital sees **500 people a day**.

---

### **Step 2: Time spent per patient**
- Each patient is seen for **24 minutes**.

---

### **Step 3: Convert time to hours (since charges are in dollars per hour)**
- 24 minutes = $ \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 $ hours

---

### **Step 4: Calculate total time spent by doctors per day**
- Total time = Number of patients × Time per patient  
  = $ 500 \times 0.4 = 200 $ hours

---

### **Step 5: Calculate cost to the hospital (doctor’s charge)**
- Doctors charge **$150 per hour**
- Total cost = $ 200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 $ dollars

---

### **Step 6: Calculate revenue from patients**
- The hospital charges **$200 per hour** to the patients
- Total revenue = $ 200 \text{ hours} \times 200 \text{ dollars/hour} = 40,000 $ dollars

---

### **Step 7: Calculate profit**
- Profit = Revenue - Cost  
  = $ 40,000 - 30,000 = 10,000 $ dollars

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
The hospital makes a **profit of $10,000 per day** from these visits.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Start with the total number of elves
Nissa hires **60** seasonal workers (elves).

### Step 2: A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them
A third of 60 is:

$$

So, **20 elves quit**.

Now, remaining elves:

$$
60 - 20 = 40
$$

### Step 3: Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins
From the 40 elves left, **10 more quit**.

Remaining elves now:

$$
40 - 10 = 30
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{30}
$$

**30 elves are left.**

Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many miles Walt walked on Tuesday.
- On **Monday**, Walt walked **4 miles**.
- On **Tuesday**, he walked **6 times as many** miles as Monday.

So:
$$
\text{Tuesday} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ miles}
$$

### Step 2: Add Monday and Tuesday's mileage.
$$
\text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} = 4 + 24 = 28 \text{ miles}
$$

### Step 3: Use the total mileage from Monday through Wednesday.
We're told that the **total** from Monday to Wednesday is **41 miles**.

So, we can find the miles walked on **Wednesday** by subtracting Monday and Tuesday’s total from the overall total:
$$
\text{Wednesday} = 41 - (4 + 24) = 41 - 28 = 13 \text{ miles}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.**

---

### Step 1: Determine how many video games Brian has **before** losing any.
The problem says:

> "Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made."

So, **before** losing 5, Brian had:

$$
20 \text{ video games}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate how many video games Bobby has.

We are told:

> "Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does."

So we use the number of video games Brian had **before** losing any (which is 20) to find out how many Bobby has.

Let’s write the expression:

$$
\text{Bobby's video games} = 3 \times (\text{Brian's video games}) - 5
$$

Substitute Brian's original number of video games (20):

$$
\text{Bobby's video games} = 3 \times 20 - 5 = 60 - 5 = 55
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{55}
$$

Bobby has **55 video games**.

Let’s define:
- Let $ B $ be the number of **blue** gumballs.
- Let $ P $ be the number of **pink** gumballs.

We are told:
$$
P = 4B + 22
$$

Substitute $ B = 12 $ into the equation:
$$
P = 4(12) + 22

Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Total number of cars
We are told there are **20** cars in total.

### Step 2: Number of automatic and manual cars
- Automatic cars = **12**
- Manual cars = **4**

### Step 3: Find the number of semi-automatic cars
To find the number of semi-automatic cars, subtract the number of automatic and manual cars from the total:

$$
\text{Semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4
$$

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars
Now, to find what percentage 4 is of 20:

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times 100 = 0.2 \times 100 = 20\%
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**20%** of the cars are semi-automatic.
We are given:

- Total number of bees = 700  
- There are **twice as many worker bees as baby bees**  
- There are **twice as many baby bees as queens**

Let’s define the variables:

Let:
- $ Q $ = number of **queens**
- $ B $ = number of **baby bees**
- $ W $ = number of **worker bees**

From the problem:

1. $ W = 2B $ (Worker bees are twice the number of baby bees)
2. $ B = 2Q $ (Baby bees are twice the number of queens)
3. Total bees: $ W + B + Q = 700 $

### Step 1: Express everything in terms of $ Q $

From (2):  
$ B = 2Q $

From (1):  
$ W = 2B = 2(2Q) = 4Q $

Now substitute into the total equation:

$$
W + B + Q = 700 \\
4Q + 2Q + Q = 700 \\
7Q = 700
$$

### Step 2: Solve for $ Q $

$$
Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100
$$

### Step 3: Find the number of worker bees

$$
W = 4Q = 4 \times 100 = \boxed{400}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **400 worker bees**

   $$

2. **If he spent that time working instead, how much would he earn?**  
   He earns **$10 per hour** at his part-time job.  
   So, in one week, he would earn:  
   $$
   14 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$140
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Identify food and non-food items
The problem says **there is a 10% tax on all non-food items**. So we need to determine which items are considered **food** and which are **non-food**.

- **Milk** – typically considered a **food item**
- **Eggs** – also a **food item**
- **Light bulbs** – **non-food**
- **Cups** – **non-food**
- **Roach traps** – **non-food**

So the **food items** are:
- Milk: $2
- Eggs: $3

Total for food items = $2 + $3 = **$5**

The **non-food items** are:
- Light bulbs: $3
- Cups: $3
- Roach traps: $4

Total for non-food items before tax = $3 + $3 + $4 = **$10**

### Step 2: Apply 10% tax on non-food items
Tax = 10% of $10 = 0.10 × $10 = **$1**

### Step 3: Add tax to non-food total
Total cost of non-food items including tax = $10 + $1 = **$11**

### Step 4: Add food and non-food totals
Total cost = Food items + Non-food items (with tax)  
= $5 + $11 = **$16**

### ✅ Final Answer: **$16**
Let's break this down step by step to find **Lucas's weekly profit**.

---

### Step 1: Determine the number of clients
- Lucas already has **3 clients**.
- He is talking to **5 more potential clients**.
- So, total number of clients =  
  $$
  3 + 5 = 8 \text{ clients}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Calculate expenses per client
Each client requires:
- **2 bottles of bleach** at **$2 each**
- **1 pack of cloths** at **$5**

So, cost per client =  
$$
(2 \times 2) + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total weekly expenses
Total number of clients = 8  
Cost per client = $9  
Total expenses =  
$$
8 \times 9 = 72 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total income per week
Lucas earns **$92 per week**.

---

### Step 5: Calculate profit
Profit = Total income - Total expenses  
$$
92 - 72 = 20 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{20} \text{ dollars}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Total number of pineapples per hectare
John has **100 pineapples per hectare**.

### Step 2: Total number of hectares
John has **10 hectares**.

So, the total number of pineapples in the entire field is:
$$
10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} = 1000 \text{ pineapples}
$$

### Step 3: Harvesting frequency
John can harvest his pineapples **every 3 months**.

### Step 4: Number of harvests in a year
There are **12 months in a year**, and he harvests every **3 months**, so:
$$
\frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ harvests per year}
$$

### Step 5: Total number of pineapples harvested in a year
Each harvest yields **1000 pineapples**, and there are **4 harvests** in a year:
$$
1000 \text{ pineapples/harvest} \times 4 \text{ harvests/year} = 4000 \text{ pineapples/year}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**John can harvest 4000 pineapples within a year.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the number of pieces in each box

- **First box**: 500 pieces  
- **Second box**: 3 times more than the first box  
  - So, $ 3 \times 500 = 1500 $ pieces  
- **Third box**: 1/4 the number of pieces in the first box  
  - So, $ \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 $ pieces  

### Step 2: Add up all the pieces

$$
500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Johnny picks up 2125 blocks.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Bees that leave in the first 6 hours

Debra sees **30 bees leave** the hive in the first 6 hours.

So:
- **Bees that left first:** 30

---

### Step 2: Bees that return in the next 6 hours

She sees **half as many bees return** as those that left first.

So:
- **Bees that returned in the second 6 hours:**  
  $ \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 $

---

### Step 3: Bees that fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours

Then, she sees **two times as many bees as she saw first leave** fly from the hive and leave.

So:
- **Bees that left in the third 6 hours:**  
  $ 2 \times 30 = 60 $

---

### Step 4: Every bee that left before that hadn’t already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours

This is a bit tricky. Let’s parse it carefully:

> "Every bee that left before that hadn’t already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours."

So we need to figure out how many bees had left before that point and had not yet returned.

Let’s track all the bees that have left up to now:

- First 6 hours: 30 bees left
- Second 6 hours: 15 bees returned (so these are not counted as leaving)
- Third 6 hours: 60 bees left

So total bees that **left** up to this point:
- 30 (first) + 60 (third) = **90 bees**

Of those 90 bees, some may have returned already. But we only know that **15 bees returned** in the second 6 hours.

So:
- Total bees that left but haven't returned = 90 - 15 = **75 bees**

So in the **next 6 hours**, **75 bees return**.

---

### Final Answer:

**Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.**

✅ **Answer: 75 bees**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the cost of admission
- **Adult ticket:** $12  
- **Child ticket:** $10  

Brittany's mom buys **1 adult ticket** and **1 child ticket**.

### Step 2: Calculate total cost
$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of adult ticket} + \text{Cost of child ticket} = 12 + 10 = 22
$$

So, the total cost for both tickets is **$22**.

### Step 3: Use the change to find how much money was given
She received **$8 in change**.

That means the amount she gave the cashier was:
$$
\text{Amount given} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Change received} = 22 + 8 = 30
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{30}
$$

Brittany's mom gave the cashier **$30**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ C $ = number of Facebook friends Charlie has
- $ D $ = number of Facebook friends Dorothy has
- $ J $ = number of Facebook friends James has

From the problem:

- **Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy**  
  So,  
  $$
  C = 3D
  $$

- **James has four times as many friends as Dorothy**  
  So,  
  $$
  J = 4D
  $$

- **Charlie has 12 friends**  
  So,  
  $$
  C = 12
  $$

---

### Step 2: Use the first equation to find Dorothy's friends

We know:
$$
C = 3D
$$
Substitute $ C = 12 $:
$$
12 = 3D
$$
Solve for $ D $:
$$
D = \frac{12}{3} = 4
$$

So, Dorothy has **4** Facebook friends.

---

### Step 3: Find James's number of friends

We know:
$$
J = 4D
$$
Substitute $ D = 4 $:
$$
J = 4 \times 4 = 16
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{16}
$$

James has **16** Facebook friends.
We are given a race between **Steve** and **Tim**, where they both try to get home from school as fast as possible. The question asks:

> **How long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?**

---

### Step 1: Convert distances to the same unit (feet)

We need to convert the distances from miles to feet, since their speeds are given in feet per minute.

- 1 mile = 5280 feet

#### Steve:
- Lives **3 miles** away from school  
  → $ 3 \times 5280 = 15,840 $ feet

#### Tim:
- Lives **2 miles** away from school  
  → $ 2 \times 5280 = 10,560 $ feet

---

### Step 2: Calculate time for each person to get home

We use the formula:

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
$$

#### Steve's time:
- Speed = 440 feet per minute  
- Distance = 15,840 feet  
$$
\text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = \frac{15,840}{440} = 36 \text{ minutes}
$$

#### Tim's time:
- Speed = 264 feet per minute  
- Distance = 10,560 feet  
$$
\text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} = \frac{10,560}{264} = 40 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine who wins and how long the winner waits

- **Steve** takes **36 minutes**
- **Tim** takes **40 minutes**

So, **Steve is the winner**, and he will wait **40 - 36 = 4 minutes** at his house before Tim finishes.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{4 \text{ minutes}}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the pricing
Shawnda charges **25 cents per tire** to inflate.

So, for every tire that gets inflated, she earns **$0.25**.

---

### Step 2: Count the number of tires inflated

#### a) Bicycles:
- Each bicycle has **2 tires**
- 5 people came on bicycles
- So, total tires from bicycles = $ 5 \times 2 = 10 $ tires

#### b) Tricycles:
- Each tricycle has **3 tires**
- 3 people came on tricycles
- So, total tires from tricycles = $ 3 \times 3 = 9 $ tires

#### c) Unicycle:
- A unicycle has **1 tire**
- 1 person came on a unicycle
- So, total tires from unicycle = $ 1 \times 1 = 1 $ tire

---

### Step 3: Total number of tires inflated
$$
10 \text{ (bicycles)} + 9 \text{ (tricycles)} + 1 \text{ (unicycle)} = 20 \text{ tires}
$$

---

### Step 4: Calculate total earnings
$$
20 \text{ tires} \times \$0.25/\text{tire} = \$5.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$5.00}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find the total number of cookies.**

Carl buys **10 packs**, and each pack has **6 cookies**:

$$
10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies per pack} = 60 \text{ cookies}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the total cost of the cookies.**

Each cookie costs **$0.10**, so:

$$
60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10 \text{ per cookie} = \$6.00
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the change from a $10 bill.**

Carl pays with a **$10 bill**, and the total cost is **$6.00**, so:

$$
\$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$4.00}
$$

Carl receives **$4.00** in change.
We are given a sequence of events involving french fries, and we need to **work backwards** from the final number of fries left to find out how many were in the pack originally.

Let’s define:

- Let $ x $ be the original number of fries in the pack.

---

### Step-by-step breakdown (working backward):

#### Final state:
- After all the events, **5 fries were left**.

#### 1. Ants carried off a final fry:
So before the ants came, there were:  
$$
5 + 1 = 6 \text{ fries}
$$

#### 2. Raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:
Let’s call the number of fries before the raccoon stole them as $ R $.  
The raccoon took $ \frac{2}{3}R $, so what was left is:
$$
R - \frac{2}{3}R = \frac{1}{3}R
$$
And that equals the 6 fries we found above:
$$
\frac{1}{3}R = 6 \Rightarrow R = 18
$$
So **before the raccoon stole**, there were **18 fries**.

#### 3. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries:
That’s $ 3 \times 3 = 9 $ fries eaten.
So before the pigeons came, there were:
$$
18 + 9 = 27 \text{ fries}
$$

#### 4. Seagull gobbled down half the amount Dave ate:
Let’s recall:  
Dave ate **14 fries** before the seagull came.  
So the seagull ate $ \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 $ fries.

So before the seagull came, there were:
$$
27 + 7 = 34 \text{ fries}
$$

#### 5. Dave ate 14 fries:
So before Dave started eating, there were:
$$
34 + 14 = 48 \text{ fries}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{48}
$$

There were **48 french fries** in the pack when Dave bought it.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the schedule**
Kimo has different class schedules on different days:

- **Monday, Wednesday, Friday** (3 days a week):  
  He has **3 classes**, each **1 hour long**.  
  So per day:  
  $ 3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours} $

- **Tuesday and Thursday** (2 days a week):  
  He has **2 classes**, each **2 hours long**.  
  So per day:  
  $ 2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours} $

---

### **Step 2: Calculate weekly total**

Now add up the hours per week:

- On **M/W/F**:  
  $ 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 9 \text{ hours} $

- On **T/Th**:  
  $ 2 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 8 \text{ hours} $

So, **weekly total** is:  
$ 9 + 8 = 17 \text{ hours/week} $

---

### **Step 3: Multiply by number of weeks in the semester**

There are **16 weeks** in the semester.

So, total class hours in one semester:  
$ 17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours} $

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester.**
Let's break the problem down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Convert all lengths to feet**

We are given measurements in inches and feet, so we need to convert everything to **feet** for consistency.

- **Rolls**: Each roll is **4 inches** long.  
  Since 1 foot = 12 inches,  
  $$
  4 \text{ inches} = \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ feet}
  $$

- **Croissants**: Each croissant is **6 inches** long.  
  $$
  6 \text{ inches} = \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ feet}
  $$

- **Baguettes**: Each baguette is **2 feet** long.  
  (Already in feet, no conversion needed.)

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total length of each item**

Now calculate how much length each type of baked good contributes when placed end to end.

#### Rolls:
Bill bakes **300 rolls**, each **1/3 foot** long.
$$
300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \text{ feet}
$$

#### Croissants:
Bill bakes **120 croissants**, each **1/2 foot** long.
$$
120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \text{ feet}
$$

#### Baguettes:
Bill bakes **60 baguettes**, each **2 feet** long.
$$
60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add up all the lengths**

Now add up the total length from all three items:
$$
100 \text{ feet} + 60 \text{ feet} + 120 \text{ feet} = 280 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{280 \text{ feet}}
$$
Let's break the problem down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many bananas each group of animals needs per month
- **Monkeys**: 200 bananas/month  
- **Gorillas**: 400 bananas/month  
- **Baboons**: 100 bananas/month  

### Step 2: Add up the monthly banana requirement for all animals
$$
200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas/month}
$$

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of bananas needed for 2 months
$$
700 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.**
Let's break this problem down step by step to find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the field and distances**

- The football field is **100 yards long**.
- A "back and forth" run means going from one end of the field to the other and back — so that's **2 × 100 = 200 yards** per round trip.

---

### **Step 2: Blake's running distance**

- Blake runs **back and forth 15 times**.
- Each back and forth = 200 yards.
- So, total distance Blake runs:

$$
15 \times 200 = 3000 \text{ yards}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Kelly's running distance**

Kelly runs in two parts:

#### **Part A: First back and forth**
- She runs **once back and forth** (from one end to the other and back).
- That’s again **200 yards**.

#### **Part B: Running to the 40-yard line and back**
- She runs **to the 40-yard line and back**, which is:
  $$
  2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ yards}
  $$
- She does this **34 times**.
- So, total for this part:
  $$
  34 \times 80 = 2720 \text{ yards}
  $$

#### **Total distance Kelly runs:**
$$
200 + 2720 = 2920 \text{ yards}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Compare the distances**

- Blake: **3000 yards**
- Kelly: **2920 yards**

So, **Blake ran farther**.

---

### **Step 5: Find the difference**

$$
3000 - 2920 = \boxed{80} \text{ yards}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Blake ran 80 yards farther than Kelly.**
Let's break down the cost of each item Raphael bought and then add them up.

---

### 1. **Cost of pens:**
- He bought **4 pens**.
- Each pen costs **$1.50**.

$$
4 \times 1.50 = 6.00
$$

So, the pens cost **$6.00**.

---

### 2. **Cost of notebooks:**
- He bought **2 notebooks**.
- Each notebook costs **$4.00**.

$$
2 \times 4.00 = 8.00
$$

So, the notebooks cost **$8.00**.

---

### 3. **Cost of bond paper:**
- He bought **1 rim of bond paper**.
- It costs **$20.00**.

$$
20.00
$$

---

### 4. **Total cost:**

Now, add all the amounts:

$$
6.00 + 8.00 + 20.00 = 34.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Raphael spent $34.00 on everything.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Start with 11 tadpoles** swimming in the pond.  
   - So, initially, Finn sees **11 tadpoles**.

2. **6 of them come out of hiding from under a lily pad**.  
   - These 6 are now visible, so they are still part of the total number of tadpoles in the pond.  
   - Total remains **11** (they just became visible).

3. **Then, 2 of them hide under a rock**.  
   - These 2 are no longer visible, but they are still in the pond.  
   - So, the number of **visible** tadpoles decreases by 2.

Now let's calculate how many **tadpoles Finn can see** now:

- Start: 11 tadpoles
- 6 come out of hiding → Still 11 total, but more visible
- 2 hide under a rock → Now only **11 - 2 = 9** are visible

### ✅ Final Answer: **9 tadpoles** that Finn can see in the pond now.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Depth on Monday
The tank has a depth of **17 feet** on Monday.

### Step 2: Depth on Tuesday
On Tuesday, the tank had **7 feet more water** than on Monday.

$$
\text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 + 7 = 24 \text{ feet}
$$

### Step 3: Depth on Wednesday
On Wednesday, the depth is **two-thirds** of what it was on Tuesday.

$$
\text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ feet}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{16 \text{ feet}}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many fish Anakin caught

Anakin caught:
- **Starfish**: 10  
- **Sea horses**: 6  
- **Clownfish**: 3  

So, total fish caught by Anakin:

$$
10 + 6 + 3 = 19 \text{ fish}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many fish Locsin caught

Locsin caught:
- **Starfish**: 5 fewer than Anakin → $10 - 5 = 5$  
- **Sea horses**: 3 fewer than Anakin → $6 - 3 = 3$  
- **Clownfish**: 2 more than Anakin → $3 + 2 = 5$

So, total fish caught by Locsin:

$$
5 + 3 + 5 = 13 \text{ fish}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add both totals to find the total number of fish caught by both

$$
19 \text{ (Anakin)} + 13 \text{ (Locsin)} = 32 \text{ fish}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{32}
$$
We are given:

- **Initial price of a bag of marbles**: $20  
- **Price increases by 20% every two months**  
- **Time period**: 36 months

---

### Step 1: Determine how many 2-month periods are in 36 months

$$
\frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ periods}
$$

So, the price will increase **18 times** over 36 months.

---

### Step 2: Understand the growth pattern

Each time, the price increases by **20% of the original price**, not 20% of the current price. This is important — it means the **increase is constant** at $20 × 20% = $4 per increase.

So, the price increases by **$4 every 2 months**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate total increase over 36 months

$$
\text{Total increase} = 18 \times 4 = 72
$$

---

### Step 4: Add the increase to the original price

$$
\text{Final price} = 20 + 72 = \boxed{92}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
After 36 months, the cost of a bag of marbles would be **$92**.
We are given the following information:

- There are:
  - 5 red cars
  - 3 action figures
  - 1 doll

- The **doll costs as much as 3 action figures**.
- One **red car costs $4**.
- We are told that an **action figure costs $5**.

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the cost of the doll

We're told:

> "The doll cost as much as 3 action figures."

Since one action figure costs **$5**, then:

$$
\text{Cost of doll} = 3 \times 5 = \$15
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine the cost of each toy type

- Red car = $4 (given)
- Action figure = $5 (given)
- Doll = $15 (calculated above)

---

### Step 3: Calculate total value of all toys

Now, we count how many of each toy there are and multiply by their respective prices:

- 5 red cars:  
  $$
  5 \times 4 = \$20
  $$

- 3 action figures:  
  $$
  3 \times 5 = \$15
  $$

- 1 doll:  
  $$
  1 \times 15 = \$15
  $$

---

### Step 4: Add them all up

$$
\$20 + \$15 + \$15 = \boxed{\$50}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$50}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **What happens if Jackie does her taxes herself?**
- She loses **3 hours** of freelance work.
- She earns **$35/hour**, so she loses:
  
  $$
  3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105
  $$

### 2. **What happens if Jackie hires an accountant?**
- She pays the accountant **$90**.

### 3. **Compare both options:**

- If she **does her own taxes**, she **loses $105** in potential income.
- If she **hires the accountant**, she **spends $90** but keeps all her freelance income.

So, the **difference** between the two options is:

$$
\$105 - \$90 = \$15
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Jackie will have **$15 more** if she hires the accountant.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing.

### Step 1: Total budget
Elvira has a total budget of:
**€1500**

---

### Step 2: Cost of the computer and accessories

- **Computer (with screen, keyboard, and mouse):** €1090  
- **Scanner:** €157  
- **CD burner:** €74  
- **Printer:** €102  

Now, let's add these up:

$$
1090 + 157 = 1247 \\
1247 + 74 = 1321 \\
1321 + 102 = 1423
$$

So, the total cost of all the items is: **€1423**

---

### Step 3: Money left for clothing

Subtract the total cost from the budget:

$$
1500 - 1423 = 77
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many eggs Sandra needs for 15 flans.
- Each flan requires **3 eggs**.
- So, for **15 flans**, she needs:
  $$
  15 \times 3 = 45 \text{ eggs}
  $$

### Step 2: Determine how many eggs Sandra gets per babysitting session.
- She gets **9 eggs** each time she babysits.

### Step 3: Calculate how many babysitting sessions are needed to get 45 eggs.
- Divide the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she gets per session:
  $$
  \frac{45}{9} = 5
  $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Sandra has to babysit **5 times**.
We are given two pieces of information:

1. **Seth is twice as old as Brooke.**
2. **In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28.**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ B $ = Brooke's current age
- $ S $ = Seth's current age

From the first statement:
$$
S = 2B \quad \text{(Seth is twice as old as Brooke)}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the second statement

In 2 years:
- Brooke will be $ B + 2 $
- Seth will be $ S + 2 $

The sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28:
$$
(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28
$$

Simplify:
$$
B + S + 4 = 28
$$

Subtract 4 from both sides:
$$
B + S = 24
$$

---

### Step 3: Substitute $ S = 2B $ into the equation

$$
B + 2B = 24
$$
$$
3B = 24
$$

Divide both sides by 3:
$$
B = 8
$$

So, Brooke is 8 years old.

Now find Seth's age:
$$
S = 2B = 2(8) = 16
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Seth is 16 years old.**
We are given:

- **Ethal has $8.**
- **Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethal has.**

### Step 1: Find twice the money Ethal has
$$
2 \times 8 = 16
$$

### Step 2: Add $2 to that amount
$$
16 + 2 = 18
$$

### Final Answer:
**Jimmy has $18.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of days in a week:** 7 days  
2. **Weekdays (Monday to Friday):** 5 days  
   - On weekdays, Pancho walks **20 miles per day**  
   - So, for 5 days:  
     $ 5 \times 20 = 100 $ miles  

3. **Weekends (Saturday and Sunday):** 2 days  
   - On weekends, Pancho walks **10 miles per day**  
   - So, for 2 days:  
     $ 2 \times 10 = 20 $ miles  

4. **Total miles walked in a week:**  
   $ 100 + 20 = 120 $ miles  

### ✅ Final Answer: **120 miles**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Cost of the hat  
The hat costs:  
$$
\$25
$$

---

### Step 2: Cost of the jacket  
The jacket costs **three times** as much as the hat:  
$$
3 \times 25 = \$75
$$

---

### Step 3: Cost of the pants  
The pants cost the **average** of the hat and jacket.  
To find the average, we add the two amounts and divide by 2:  
$$
\text{Average} = \frac{25 + 75}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = \$50
$$

---

### Step 4: Total cost of one uniform  
Now, add up the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants:  
$$
25 + 75 + 50 = \$150
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$150}
$$

Each uniform costs **\$150** total.
Let's break this down step by step to find the **total number of legs** Jake sees.

---

### Step 1: Spiders
- Number of spiders = 80  
- Legs per spider = 8  
- Total legs from spiders =  
  $$
  80 \times 8 = 640
  $$

---

### Step 2: Insects
- Number of insects = 90  
- Legs per insect = 6  
- Total legs from insects =  
  $$
  90 \times 6 = 540
  $$

---

### Step 3: Rare mutant invertebrates
- Number of mutants = 3  
- Legs per mutant = 10  
- Total legs from mutants =  
  $$
  3 \times 10 = 30
  $$

---

### Step 4: Add them all together
$$
640 + 540 + 30 = 1210
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jake sees a total of 1210 legs.**
Let's break this down step by step.

We are told:

1. **Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.**
2. **Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.**
3. **Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.**
4. **Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.**

---

### Step 1: Use the known value

From (4):  
**Sally Thirtytwo = 8 years old**

From (3):  
**Sally Four = Sally Thirtytwo = 8 years old**

---

### Step 2: Use (2) to find Granny Red's age

From (2):  
**Granny Red = 2 × Sally Four = 2 × 8 = 16 years old**

---

### Step 3: Use (1) to find Sally Two's age

From (1):  
**Sally Two = Granny Red + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19 years old**

---

### Step 4: Total age of the four birds

Now we know the ages of all four birds:

- Sally Two = 19
- Granny Red = 16
- Sally Four = 8
- Sally Thirtytwo = 8

So, total age =  
**19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**51 years**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Find the minimum monthly payments for each debt
- **Student loans:** $300/month  
- **Credit card:** $200/month  
- **Mortgage:** $500/month  

### Step 2: Calculate 50% more than the minimum for each
Jessica wants to pay **50% more** than the minimum. That means she pays **150%** of the minimum.

So, we calculate:
- **Student loans:**  
  $ 300 \times 1.5 = 450 $  
- **Credit card:**  
  $ 200 \times 1.5 = 300 $  
- **Mortgage:**  
  $ 500 \times 1.5 = 750 $

### Step 3: Add up the monthly total
$$
450 + 300 + 750 = 1500
$$

### Step 4: Multiply by 12 to get the annual payment
$$
1500 \times 12 = 18,000
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jessica pays $18,000 per year.**
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how long it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes.

---

### **Step 1: Time per potato**

Each potato requires two actions:

- **Peeling:** 1.5 minutes per potato  
- **Cutting:** 5 seconds per potato

So, we need to convert all times to the same unit (either minutes or seconds). Let's use **seconds** for consistency.

- 1.5 minutes = **90 seconds**
- Cutting time = **5 seconds**

So, total time per potato is:

$$
90 \text{ seconds (peeling)} + 5 \text{ seconds (cutting)} = 95 \text{ seconds per potato}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Total time for 60 potatoes**

Now, multiply the time per potato by the number of potatoes:

$$
60 \text{ potatoes} \times 95 \text{ seconds per potato} = 5700 \text{ seconds}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Convert seconds to minutes**

To make it easier to understand, let's convert 5700 seconds into minutes:

$$
5700 \div 60 = 95 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Billy will take 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.**
We are given:

- **Cost per gallon:**
  - Lemons: $3
  - Sugar: $2
  - **Total cost per gallon = $3 + $2 = $5**

- **Revenue per gallon:**
  - They get **20 glasses per gallon**.
  - Each glass sells for **$0.50**.
  - **Revenue per gallon = 20 × $0.50 = $10**

- **Profit per gallon = Revenue - Cost = $10 - $5 = $5**

So, they make a **profit of $5 per gallon**.

---

### Now, we're told that their total **profit is $25**.

Let’s find out how many gallons they made:

$$
\text{Number of gallons} = \frac{\text{Total profit}}{\text{Profit per gallon}} = \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### Finally, to find how much they spent on lemons:

- **Lemons cost $3 per gallon**
- They used **5 gallons**
- **Total cost for lemons = 5 × $3 = $15**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**They spent $15 on lemons.**
We are given the following information:

- Total number of Asians = 240  
- Number of Japanese Asians = 80  
- The rest are Chinese, so number of Chinese Asians = 240 - 80 = **160**

We are also told:
- Number of **boys** on the Chinese team = 60

We are asked to find the number of **girls** on the Chinese team.

---

### Step-by-step:

1. Total number of Chinese Asians = 160  
2. Number of boys on the Chinese team = 60  
3. Therefore, number of girls on the Chinese team = Total Chinese Asians - Number of boys

$$
\text{Number of girls} = 160 - 60 = \boxed{100}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **100 girls** were on the Chinese team.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Zaid's monthly salary
Zaid earns **$6000** per month.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the amount spent on rent
He spends **1/4** of his salary on rent:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500
$$

So, **rent = $1500**

---

### Step 3: Calculate the amount spent on car fuel
He spends **1/3** of his salary on car fuel:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000
$$

So, **car fuel = $2000**

---

### Step 4: Total spent on rent and car fuel
$$
1500 + 2000 = 3500
$$

So, **total spent on rent and car fuel = $3500**

---

### Step 5: Remaining amount after rent and car fuel
$$
6000 - 3500 = 2500
$$

So, **remaining amount = $2500**

---

### Step 6: Donate half of the remaining amount to charity
He donates **half** of the remaining $2500 to charity:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250
$$

So, **charity donation = $1250**

---

### Step 7: Remaining amount after charity donation
$$
2500 - 1250 = 1250
$$

So, **remaining amount after charity = $1250**

---

### Step 8: Give $200 to daughter for weekly expenses
$$
1250 - 200 = 1050
$$

So, **after giving $200 to daughter = $1050**

---

### Step 9: Give $700 to wife for groceries and household goods
$$
1050 - 700 = 350
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Zaid will have $350 left after all expenses and donations.**
We are given:

- Bo has **40** crabs.
- Monic has **4 fewer** crabs than Bo.
- Rani has **10 more** crabs than Monic.

Let's solve step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find how many crabs Monic has

Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo:

$$
\text{Monic} = \text{Bo} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many crabs Rani has

Rani has 10 more crabs than Monic:

$$
\text{Rani} = \text{Monic} + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46
$$

---

### Step 3: Add up the total number of crabs

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Bo} + \text{Monic} + \text{Rani} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{122}
$$
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Hourly rate**: Lloyd earns **$10 per hour**.

2. **First week**: He tutored for **5 hours**.  
   So, his earnings for the first week are:  
   $$
   5 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$50
   $$

3. **Second week**: He tutored for **8 hours**.  
   So, his earnings for the second week are:  
   $$
   8 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$80
   $$

4. **Total earnings for two weeks**:  
   $$
   \$50 + \$80 = \$130
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **\$130**
We are told:

- There are **80 students** who voted.
- The **winner got 3/4 of the votes**.
- We need to find the number of votes the **loser got**.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of votes the winner received

The winner got $ \frac{3}{4} $ of the total votes. So:

$$
\text{Votes for winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
$$

---

### Step 2: Subtract from total to find the loser's votes

$$
\text{Votes for loser} = 80 - 60 = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{20}
$$

The loser got **20 votes**.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out **how many red roses Fred must deliver**.

---

### Step 1: Define Variables

Let:
- $ W $ = number of **white carnations**
- $ R $ = number of **red roses**
- $ C $ = number of **pink calla lilies**

We are told:

1. Sandra ordered **four times as many red roses as white carnations**:
   $$
   R = 4W
   $$

2. She also ordered **200 pink calla lilies**, which were **five times the number of white carnations**:
   $$
   C = 5W
   $$

3. We are also told that **she ordered 200 pink calla lilies**:
   $$
   C = 200
   $$

---

### Step 2: Use the Pink Calla Lilies Info to Find $ W $

From above, we know:
$$
C = 5W \quad \text{and} \quad C = 200
$$

So:
$$
5W = 200
$$

Solve for $ W $:
$$
W = \frac{200}{5} = 40
$$

---

### Step 3: Use $ W $ to Find $ R $

Recall:
$$
R = 4W
$$

Substitute $ W = 40 $:
$$
R = 4 \times 40 = 160
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Fred must deliver **160 red roses** by 5 pm to satisfy Sandra's order.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Given:
1. **Jean is two years older than Mark.**
2. **Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.**
3. **Jan is currently 30 years old.**

We are asked to find: **How old is Jean?**

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s define:

- Let **J** = Jean's current age  
- Let **M** = Mark's current age  
- Jan's current age = **30** (given)

From the first statement:

> **Jean is two years older than Mark.**

So:

$$
J = M + 2 \tag{1}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the second statement

> **Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.**

Let’s translate this into an equation.

- Two years ago, Mark’s age was: $ M - 2 $
- Two years ago, Jan’s age was: $ 30 - 2 = 28 $
- Half of Jan’s age two years ago: $ \frac{28}{2} = 14 $
- So, Mark’s age two years ago was: $ 14 + 5 = 19 $

So:

$$
M - 2 = 19 \tag{2}
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for Mark’s age

From equation (2):

$$
M - 2 = 19 \\
M = 19 + 2 = 21
$$

So, **Mark is 21 years old**.

---

### Step 4: Find Jean’s age

From equation (1):

$$
J = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Jean is 23 years old.**
We are given a **4 by 400 meter relay race** between two teams. Each team has **four runners**, and each runner runs **one lap (400 meters)**.

---

### **Team A: Well-rounded**
- All four runners run their leg in **55 seconds**.
- So, the total time for Team A is:

$$
55 \times 4 = 220 \text{ seconds}
$$

---

### **Team B: Less well-rounded**
- First runner: **60 seconds**
- Each subsequent runner is **3 seconds faster than the previous one**

So the times for Team B's runners are:
- Runner 1: **60 seconds**
- Runner 2: **60 - 3 = 57 seconds**
- Runner 3: **57 - 3 = 54 seconds**
- Runner 4: **54 - 3 = 51 seconds**

Total time for Team B:

$$
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
$$

---

### **Compare the two teams:**
- Team A: **220 seconds**
- Team B: **222 seconds**

So, **Team A wins** by:

$$
222 - 220 = \boxed{2} \text{ seconds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{2} \text{ seconds}
$$
We are given that Jerry is rolling a **six-sided die** and we want to compare the **probability of rolling a number greater than 3** with the **probability of rolling two even numbers in a row**. Then, we will find how much **more likely** the first event is compared to the second (expressed as a **percentage**).

---

### Step 1: Understand the outcomes

A standard six-sided die has faces labeled:  
**{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}**

---

### Step 2: Probability of rolling a number greater than 3

Numbers greater than 3 on a die are:  
**{4, 5, 6}** → 3 outcomes

So, the probability is:

$$
P(\text{>3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
$$

---

### Step 3: Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row

Even numbers on a die: **{2, 4, 6}** → 3 outcomes

So, the probability of rolling an even number once is:

$$
P(\text{even}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

$$
P(\text{two evens}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
$$

---

### Step 4: Compare the probabilities

We now compare the two probabilities:

- $ P(\text{>3}) = 0.5 $
- $ P(\text{two evens}) = 0.25 $

The question asks: **How much more likely is it that he rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row?**

This is asking for the **percentage increase** from the smaller probability to the larger one.

So, we compute:

$$
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Smaller value}} \right) \times 100\%
$$

$$
= \left( \frac{0.5 - 0.25}{0.25} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{0.25}{0.25} \right) \times 100\% = 100\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{100\%}
$$

So, it is **100% more likely** that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.
Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Jenna's mom picked 20 apples.**  
   So, Mom = 20 apples.

2. **Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom.**  
   That means Jenna picked:  
   $$
   \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ apples}
   $$

3. **To find the total number of apples they both picked:**  
   $$
   \text{Total} = \text{Mom's apples} + \text{Jenna's apples} = 20 + 10 = 30
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **30 apples**
We are given the following information:

- There are **3 cages** of **rats**, and the rats are kept in **equal groups**.
- Each rat is given **6 pieces of straw**.
- There are **10 cages** of **hamsters**, each kept alone, and each hamster is given **5 pieces of straw**.
- There is a **pen of rabbits** where **20 pieces of straw** are distributed among the rabbits.
- A total of **160 pieces of straw** have been distributed among all small rodents.

We are asked: **How many rats are in each cage?**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ r $ = number of rats in **each cage**
- Since there are 3 cages with equal numbers of rats, total number of rats = $ 3r $

---

### Step 2: Calculate straw used for rats

Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so total straw for rats is:

$$
\text{Straw for rats} = 3r \times 6 = 18r
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate straw used for hamsters

There are 10 cages of hamsters, each kept alone. So total number of hamsters = 10.

Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw:

$$
\text{Straw for hamsters} = 10 \times 5 = 50
$$

---

### Step 4: Straw for rabbits

Given directly:

$$
\text{Straw for rabbits} = 20
$$

---

### Step 5: Total straw used

Total straw used = straw for rats + straw for hamsters + straw for rabbits:

$$
18r + 50 + 20 = 160
$$

Simplify:

$$
18r + 70 = 160
$$

Subtract 70 from both sides:

$$
18r = 90
$$

Divide both sides by 18:

$$
r = \frac{90}{18} = 5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{5}
$$

So, **there are 5 rats in each cage**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Given:
- **Principal (P)** = $100  
- **Monthly interest rate (r)** = 2% = 0.02  
- **Time (t)** = 3 months

We are to find the **total amount** Mandy should pay after 3 months, including interest.

---

### Step 1: Use the simple interest formula

$$
\text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t
$$

Plug in the values:

$$
\text{Interest} = 100 \times 0.02 \times 3 = 6
$$

So, the interest over 3 months is **$6**.

---

### Step 2: Add the interest to the principal

$$
\text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest} = 100 + 6 = 106
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Mandy should give **$106** to Benedict.
We are given the following information:

- **Cost price per bag (from farmer):** $20  
- **Transport cost per bag:** $2  
- **Selling price per bag:** $30  
- **Total profit:** $400  

We need to find: **How many bags did the trader sell?**

---

### Step 1: Calculate total cost per bag

The trader pays **$20** to the farmer and **$2** for transport, so:

$$
\text{Total cost per bag} = 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate profit per bag

He sells each bag for **$30**, so:

$$
\text{Profit per bag} = 30 - 22 = 8 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Use total profit to find number of bags

Let the number of bags be **x**.

$$
\text{Total profit} = \text{Profit per bag} \times x = 8x
$$

We are told that the total profit is **$400**, so:

$$
8x = 400
$$

$$
x = \frac{400}{8} = 50
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{50}
$$

The trader sold **50 bags**.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much each friend paid.

---

### **Step 1: Cost of tickets**
They spent **$20.25** on **3 tickets**.

So, the cost of tickets is:

$$
\text{Cost of tickets} = \$20.25
$$

---

### **Step 2: Cost of food**
They spent **$4.50 less on food than on the tickets**, so:

$$
\text{Cost of food} = \$20.25 - \$4.50 = \$15.75
$$

---

### **Step 3: Cost of rides**
They went on **2 different rides**, and each ride costs **$33**.

$$
\text{Total cost of rides} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total cost**
Now we add up all the costs:

$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{Tickets} + \text{Food} + \text{Rides}
$$
$$
= \$20.25 + \$15.75 + \$66 = \$102
$$

---

### **Step 5: Split the total evenly among 3 friends**

$$
\text{Each person pays} = \frac{\$102}{3} = \$34
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Each friend paid $34.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **John collects peaches for 3 hours.**  
   We need to convert this into minutes because his collection rate is given per minute.

   - There are **60 minutes in an hour**, so:
     $$
     3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes}
     $$

2. **He collects 2 peaches per minute.**  
   So, in one minute, he gets 2 peaches.

3. **Total peaches collected:**  
   Multiply the number of minutes by the number of peaches per minute:
   $$
   180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **360 peaches**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Each duck eats 3.5 pounds of insects per week.**
2. **There are 10 ducks in the flock.**

### Step 1: Find total insect consumption per week for all ducks.
$$
\text{Total per week} = 3.5 \, \text{pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \, \text{ducks} = 35 \, \text{pounds/week}
$$

### Step 2: Convert weekly consumption to daily consumption.
There are 7 days in a week, so:
$$
\text{Daily consumption} = \frac{35 \, \text{pounds/week}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 5 \, \text{pounds/day}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The flock of 10 ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the yearly changes**

- **Trees planted per year:** 10
- **Trees chopped down per year:** 2
- **Net change per year:**  
  $ 10 - 2 = 8 $ trees added per year

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total number of trees after 10 years**

He starts with **50 trees**.

After 10 years, he adds **8 trees per year**, so:

$$
\text{Total trees after 10 years} = 50 + (10 \times 8) = 50 + 80 = 130
$$

---

### **Step 3: Account for the 30% of trees dying**

30% of the trees die after 10 years. So we calculate how many trees that is:

$$
\text{Trees that die} = 0.30 \times 130 = 39
$$

$$
\text{Trees remaining} = 130 - 39 = 91
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{91}
$$

Tom has **91 trees left** after 10 years.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Friday Morning**
- The neighbors place **18 pink plastic flamingos** in Sue's front yard.

So, at the start of Friday:
- **Pink flamingos:** 18  
- **White flamingos:** 0

---

### **Step 2: Saturday Morning**
- The neighbors **take back one third** of the flamingos.
- One third of 18 is:  
  $$
  \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
  $$

So, they remove **6 pink flamingos** and paint them white. Then they put them back.

Now:
- **Pink flamingos:** $ 18 - 6 = 12 $
- **White flamingos:** $ 0 + 6 = 6 $

---

### **Step 3: Sunday Morning**
- The neighbors **add another 18 pink flamingos** to the collection.

Now:
- **Pink flamingos:** $ 12 + 18 = 30 $
- **White flamingos:** Still 6 (no change)

---

### **Final Count (at noon on Sunday):**
- **Pink flamingos:** 30  
- **White flamingos:** 6

To find how many **more pink flamingos** there are than white ones:

$$
30 - 6 = \boxed{24}
$$

---

### ✅ **Answer: 24**
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Determine the total cost of the crayons:**

   Violetta wants 5 different colors of crayons, and each crayon costs $2.

   So, the total cost is:
   $$
   5 \text{ crayons} \times \$2 \text{ per crayon} = \$10
   $$

2. **Subtract the total cost from the amount she prepared:**

   Violetta has $20.

   So, her change will be:
   $$
   \$20 - \$10 = \$10
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: Violetta will get **\$10** in change.
We are given the following information:

- A **pencil costs $1.20**
- An **eraser costs $0.30**
- A **pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined**

---

### Step 1: Find the cost of one pen

The problem says:

> A pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined.

So, we add the cost of a pencil and an eraser:

$$
\text{Cost of one pen} = \text{Cost of pencil} + \text{Cost of eraser}
$$

$$
= 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
$$

So, **one pen costs $1.50**.

---

### Step 2: Find the cost of 8 pens

Now, multiply the cost of one pen by 8:

$$
\text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$12.00}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Total amount of carrots
We are given:
- **200 pounds** of carrots in total.

### Step 2: Number of restaurants and amount per restaurant
- There are **40 restaurants**.
- Each restaurant is to receive **2 pounds** of carrots.

### Step 3: Total amount of carrots needed
To find how many pounds of carrots will be used, multiply the number of restaurants by the amount each gets:

$$
\text{Total used} = 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ pounds}
$$

### Step 4: Calculate the unused carrots
Subtract the amount used from the total amount available:

$$
\text{Unused carrots} = 200 - 80 = 120 \text{ pounds}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**120 pounds of carrots will not be used.**
We are given:

- Total population of Soda = **23,786**
- Number of men = **8,417**
- Number of women = **9,092**

We are asked to find the number of **children**.

---

### Step 1: Add the number of men and women
$$
8,417 + 9,092 = 17,509
$$

### Step 2: Subtract this from the total population to find the number of children
$$
23,786 - 17,509 = 6,277
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{6277}
$$

There are **6,277 children** in Soda.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many Pokémon cards Elaine has in total now.

---

### **Step 1: Initial number of cards**
Elaine initially had:
$$
20 \text{ cards}
$$

---

### **Step 2: First month**
She collected **three times** that number:
$$
3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ cards}
$$

So, after the first month, she has:
$$
20 + 60 = 80 \text{ cards}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Second month**
She collected **20 fewer** cards than in the first month:
$$
60 - 20 = 40 \text{ cards}
$$

Now, total cards:
$$
80 + 40 = 120 \text{ cards}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Third month**
She collected **twice the combined number** of cards from the first and second months.

First, find the **combined number** from the first and second months:
$$
60 + 40 = 100 \text{ cards}
$$

Then, she collected:
$$
2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ cards}
$$

Now, total cards:
$$
120 + 200 = 320 \text{ cards}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{320} \text{ Pokémon cards}
$$
We are told:

- Mark edits **1000 sentences** each week.
- He edits an **equal number of sentences** for **two publishers**, A and B.
- **Publisher A** pays **5 cents per sentence**.
- **Publisher B** pays **twice** what Publisher A pays, so **10 cents per sentence**.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher

Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers and the total is 1000:

$$
\text{Sentences per publisher} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500
$$

So:
- He edits **500 sentences** for **Publisher A**
- He edits **500 sentences** for **Publisher B**

---

### Step 2: Calculate earnings from each publisher

- From **Publisher A**:  
  $$
  500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
  $$

- From **Publisher B**:  
  $$
  500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Add the earnings from both publishers

$$
2500 + 5000 = 7500 \text{ cents}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{7500} \text{ cents}
$$
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Find the total number of pails per day
- **Morning:** 5 pails  
- **Afternoon:** 6 pails  
- **Total pails per day = 5 + 6 = 11 pails**

### Step 2: Find the total amount of water per day
- Each pail contains **5 liters** of water.
- So, total water = number of pails × liters per pail  
- Total water = 11 pails × 5 liters/pail = **55 liters**

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand John's weekly salary**
John makes **$2000 per week**.

There are **52 weeks in a year**, so:

$$
\text{Annual salary before the award} = 2000 \times 52 = 104,000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Apply the 5% raise**
He gets a **5% raise** in salary. So we calculate the new weekly salary after the raise:

$$
\text{Raise amount} = 2000 \times 0.05 = 100
$$

$$
\text{New weekly salary} = 2000 + 100 = 2100
$$

Now calculate the new annual salary with the raise:

$$
\text{New annual salary} = 2100 \times 52 = 109,200
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add the one-time monetary reward**
He also receives a **one-time reward of $5000** on the first day of the year.

So total money he made that year is:

$$
\text{Total earnings} = \text{New annual salary} + \text{One-time reward}
$$

$$
= 109,200 + 5,000 = \boxed{114,200}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**John made $114,200 that year.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total acres of the farm**:  
   Josie has a **10-acre** farm.

2. **Grapes produced per acre per year**:  
   Each acre produces **5 tons** of grapes per year.

3. **Total grapes produced per year**:  
   $$
   10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons}
   $$

4. **Wine produced per ton of grapes**:  
   Each ton of grapes makes **2 barrels** of wine.

5. **Total wine produced per year**:  
   $$
   50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year.**
Let's break the problem down step by step to find out how many slices of cheese Carl used in total.

---

### 1. **Cheese used for sandwiches (lunch)**

- Carl ate a sandwich every day this week.
- There are **7 days** in a week.
- Each sandwich uses **2 slices** of cheese.

So, cheese used for lunch:

$$
7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### 2. **Cheese used for omelets (breakfast)**

- He had **3 days** of cheese and egg omelets.
- He used **one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich**.
- Since each sandwich used **2 slices**, then each omelet used:

$$
2 + 1 = 3 \text{ slices per omelet}
$$

So, cheese used for breakfast:

$$
3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### 3. **Cheese used for macaroni and cheese (dinner)**

- He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him **several dinners** for the week.
- The problem says he used **8 slices** of cheese in it.

So, cheese used for dinner:

$$
8 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### 4. **Total cheese used**

Now, add up all the cheese used:

$$
\text{Lunch: } 14 \text{ slices} \\
\text{Breakfast: } 9 \text{ slices} \\
\text{Dinner: } 8 \text{ slices}
$$

$$
\text{Total cheese used} = 14 + 9 + 8 = \boxed{31} \text{ slices}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **31 slices of cheese**
Let's solve this step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Count the green and yellow pens**
- Janet had **22 green pens**.
- She also had **10 yellow pens**.

So, total of green and yellow pens:
$$
22 + 10 = 32 \text{ pens}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the number of blue pens**
- She bought **6 bags of blue pens**.
- Each bag has **9 pens**.

Total blue pens:
$$
6 \times 9 = 54 \text{ pens}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the number of red pens**
- She bought **2 bags of red pens**.
- Each bag has **6 pens**.

Total red pens:
$$
2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ pens}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add all the pens together**
Now add up all the pens:
- Green: 22  
- Yellow: 10  
- Blue: 54  
- Red: 12  

$$
22 + 10 + 54 + 12 = 98
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{98} \text{ pens}
$$
We are told that Brinley has taken **five tests** so far, with scores:

- 89  
- 71  
- 92  
- 100  
- 86  

She will take a **sixth test**, and then Mr. Bert will **remove the lowest score** from the six to compute the average.

Our goal is to find what **score she needs on the sixth test** so that her **average of the five highest scores** (after removing the lowest) is **93**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the process

- She will have **6 test scores**.
- The **lowest score** is dropped.
- The **average of the remaining 5 scores** must be **93**.

So we need to find a score $ x $ such that when we add it to the list of five scores, remove the lowest, and average the other five, the result is 93.

---

### Step 2: List all possible scenarios

Let’s denote the scores as:

$$
\text{Scores} = \{89, 71, 92, 100, 86, x\}
$$

We want the **average of the top 5 scores** (after dropping the lowest) to be **93**.

That means the **sum of the top 5 scores** should be:

$$
93 \times 5 = 465
$$

So we need to find an $ x $ such that, after adding it to the list and removing the lowest, the sum of the remaining 5 scores is **465**.

---

### Step 3: Try different values for $ x $

Let’s consider the current five scores:

$$
\{89, 71, 92, 100, 86\}
$$

Let’s first **sort them** to better understand which one is the lowest:

$$
\{71, 86, 89, 92, 100\}
$$

So the **lowest** score is **71**.

Now, let's suppose that the **lowest score among the six** is still **71**, and the sixth test score $ x $ is **not lower than 71**. Then the five highest scores would be:

$$
\{x, 86, 89, 92, 100\}
$$

We can now write the equation:

$$
x + 86 + 89 + 92 + 100 = 465
$$

Add up the known values:

$$
86 + 89 + 92 + 100 = 367
$$

So:

$$
x + 367 = 465
$$

$$
x = 465 - 367 = 98
$$

✅ So, if Brinley scores **98** on the sixth test, and the lowest score is still **71**, then the five highest scores are:

$$
\{98, 86, 89, 92, 100\}
$$

Their sum is:

$$
98 + 86 + 89 + 92 + 100 = 465
$$

Average is:

$$
\frac{465}{5} = 93
$$

✅ That works!

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Brinley needs to score **98** on the sixth test to get an average of **93** after dropping the lowest score.
Let's break the problem into two parts and calculate the total kilometers Micheal rode in each period.

---

### **Part 1: First 4 weeks**

- He rides **at least 5 times a week**.
- Each ride is **25 kilometers**.
- Duration: **4 weeks**.

So, the number of rides in this period is:

$$
5 \text{ rides/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ rides}
$$

Total kilometers for this period:

$$
20 \text{ rides} \times 25 \text{ km/ride} = 500 \text{ km}
$$

---

### **Part 2: Next 3 weeks**

- He rides **2 times a week**.
- Each ride is **60 kilometers**.
- Duration: **3 weeks**.

Number of rides:

$$
2 \text{ rides/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 6 \text{ rides}
$$

Total kilometers for this period:

$$
6 \text{ rides} \times 60 \text{ km/ride} = 360 \text{ km}
$$

---

### **Total Kilometers**

Add both parts together:

$$
500 \text{ km} + 360 \text{ km} = \boxed{860} \text{ km}
$$

---

✅ **Final Answer: 860 kilometers**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Given:
- Joe has **25 chocolate bars** and **80 candied apples**.
- Each **chocolate bar weighs 40 grams**.
- Each **chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a candied apple**.

---

### Step 1: Find the weight of one candied apple

We are told:

$$
\text{Weight of one chocolate bar} = 2 \times \text{Weight of one candied apple}
$$

Since each chocolate bar weighs **40 grams**, then:

$$
40 = 2 \times \text{Weight of one candied apple}
$$

Divide both sides by 2:

$$
\text{Weight of one candied apple} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate total weight of all chocolate bars

$$
25 \text{ chocolate bars} \times 40 \text{ grams per bar} = 1000 \text{ grams}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate total weight of all candied apples

$$
80 \text{ candied apples} \times 20 \text{ grams per apple} = 1600 \text{ grams}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add the two weights together to find the total weight of the bag

$$
1000 \text{ grams (chocolate bars)} + 1600 \text{ grams (candied apples)} = 2600 \text{ grams}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{2600} \text{ grams}
$$
Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday**:  
   Rose bought **4 cakes**.

2. **Tuesday**:  
   She bought **three times** the number of cakes she bought on Monday.  
   So,  
   $ 3 \times 4 = 12 $ cakes.

3. **Wednesday**:  
   She bought **five times** the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday.  
   So,  
   $ 5 \times 12 = 60 $ cakes.

### Now, add them all together to find the total number of cakes:

$$
4 + 12 + 60 = 76
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **76 cakes**.
We are given:

- **Twenty dozen cups** cost **$1200 less** than the total cost of **half a dozen plates**, each sold at **$6000**.

We are to find:  
**The total cost of buying each cup.**

---

### Step 1: Understand the quantities

- **One dozen = 12 items**
- So, **twenty dozen cups = 20 × 12 = 240 cups**
- **Half a dozen plates = 6 plates**

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates

Each plate costs **$6000**, so:

$$
\text{Cost of 6 plates} = 6 \times 6000 = 36,000
$$

---

### Step 3: Set up the equation

Let the **total cost of 240 cups** be $ C $

According to the problem:

$$
C = 36,000 - 1200 = 34,800
$$

So, the **total cost of 240 cups is $34,800**

---

### Step 4: Find the cost per cup

$$
\text{Cost per cup} = \frac{34,800}{240}
$$

$$
= 145
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\$145}
$$

So, the **total cost of buying each cup is \$145**.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford the jacket and shoes.

---

### **1. Total Cost of the Items**

- **Jacket**: $30  
- **2 pairs of shoes**: 2 × $20 = $40  
- **Total cost**:  
  $$
  30 + 40 = \$70
  $$

---

### **2. How Much Sara Already Has**

Sara already has:
$$
\$10 \text{ saved}
$$

---

### **3. How Much More She Needs**

$$
\$70 - \$10 = \$60
$$

So Sara needs **$60 more** to afford the jacket and shoes.

---

### **4. How Much She Earns from Babysitting**

She babysits **4 times**, earning **$5 each time**:

$$
4 \times 5 = \$20
$$

---

### **5. How Much She Still Needs After Babysitting**

$$
\$60 - \$20 = \$40
$$

So after babysitting, she still needs **$40 more**.

---

### **6. How Much She Earns Per Lawn Mowing**

She earns **$4 per lawn mowing**.

To find out how many lawns she needs to mow to get the remaining $40:

$$
\frac{40}{4} = 10
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Sara must mow the lawn **10 times** to afford the jacket and shoes.
We are given:

- Each **red chicken** produces **3 eggs per day**.
- Each **white chicken** produces **5 eggs per day**.
- Jerry collects **42 eggs per day**.
- He has **two more white chickens than red chickens**.

Let’s define:

- Let $ r $ be the number of **red chickens**.
- Then the number of **white chickens** is $ r + 2 $ (since there are two more white chickens).

Now, we can write an equation for the total number of eggs collected per day:

$$
\text{Total eggs} = (\text{Number of red chickens}) \times 3 + (\text{Number of white chickens}) \times 5
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
3r + 5(r + 2) = 42
$$

Now simplify:

$$
3r + 5r + 10 = 42
$$

$$
8r + 10 = 42
$$

Subtract 10 from both sides:

$$
8r = 32
$$

Divide by 8:

$$
r = 4
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
Jerry has **4 red chickens**.
To find out how many hours Gary spends walking around the edge of the park, we need to:

---

### **Step 1: Find the perimeter of the rectangular park**

The park is a rectangle with:
- Length = 6 miles  
- Width = 1.5 miles  

The **perimeter** of a rectangle is given by:

$$
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
$$

$$
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the time taken to walk around the park**

Gary walks at a speed of **3 miles per hour**.

Time is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
$$

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{5 \text{ hours}}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information

- **Day 1:** Sloane counts **100 customers**.
- **Day 2:** She counts **50 more customers than Day 1**, so:
  
  $$
  \text{Day 2} = 100 + 50 = 150
  $$

- **Total number of customers over 3 days:** **500**

We are asked to find how many customers she counted on **Day 3**.

---

### Step 2: Set up an equation

Let’s call the number of customers on **Day 3** as $ x $.

So, the total number of customers over the three days is:

$$
\text{Day 1} + \text{Day 2} + \text{Day 3} = 500
$$

Substitute the known values:

$$
100 + 150 + x = 500
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

$$
250 + x = 500
$$

$$
x = 500 - 250
$$

$$
x = 250
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{250}
$$

Sloane counted **250 customers** on the third day.
We are given the following information:

- Both pools have **leaks** that empty them at a rate of **4 gallons per minute**.
- **4 minutes ago**, the **big pool had twice as much water as the small pool**.
- **Now**, the **big pool has four times as much water as the small pool**.

We are to find: **How much water does the small pool have now?**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ S $ = amount of water in the **small pool now**
- $ B $ = amount of water in the **big pool now**

We are to find $ S $.

---

### Step 2: Express what happened 4 minutes ago

Since both pools are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, in 4 minutes, each pool has lost:

$$
\text{Water lost in 4 minutes} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ gallons}
$$

So, **4 minutes ago**, the small pool had:

$$
S + 16 \text{ gallons}
$$

And the big pool had:

$$
B + 16 \text{ gallons}
$$

According to the problem, **4 minutes ago**, the big pool had **twice as much water** as the small pool:

$$
B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
$$

---

### Step 3: Use the current relationship between the pools

We're told that **now**, the big pool has **four times as much water** as the small pool:

$$
B = 4S
$$

---

### Step 4: Substitute into the first equation

From earlier:

$$
B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
$$

Substitute $ B = 4S $ into this:

$$
4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
$$

Simplify the right-hand side:

$$
4S + 16 = 2S + 32
$$

Subtract $ 2S $ from both sides:

$$
2S + 16 = 32
$$

Subtract 16 from both sides:

$$
2S = 16
$$

Divide by 2:

$$
S = 8
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{8} \text{ gallons}
$$

So, the **small pool has 8 gallons of water now**.
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Total cost of the items:**
- Shoes: $320.00  
- Belt: $32.00  
- **Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00**

### 2. **How much Lori earns per hour:**
- Lori earns **$8.00 per hour**.

### 3. **How many hours does she need to work?**
To find out how many hours she needs to work, divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

$$
\text{Hours needed} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Hourly wage}} = \frac{352}{8}
$$

$$
\text{Hours needed} = 44
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Lori will have to work **44 hours** to afford the shoes and belt.
Let's break this down step by step to find **Janeth's remaining balance** after 12 months of monthly payments.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the total amount Janeth owes**

Janeth borrowed **$2000** and promised to return it with an **additional 10%** of the amount.

So, the total amount she must pay back is:

$$
\text{Total Amount} = 2000 + (10\% \text{ of } 2000) = 2000 + 200 = \$2200
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total amount paid over 12 months**

She pays **$165 per month** for **12 months**:

$$
\text{Total Paid} = 165 \times 12 = \$1980
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the remaining balance**

Now subtract the amount she has already paid from the total amount she owes:

$$
\text{Remaining Balance} = 2200 - 1980 = \$220
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$220}
$$

Janeth will have a **remaining balance of $220** after 12 months of payments.
We are given:

- There are **4 roses** in the vase.
- There are **7 more dahlias than roses**.

### Step 1: Find the number of dahlias
Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses, and there are 4 roses:

$$
\text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 7 = 11
$$

### Step 2: Find the total number of flowers
Now, add the number of roses and dahlias:

$$
\text{Total flowers} = \text{roses} + \text{dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{15}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the relationships**

We are told:

- Harriet is **21 years old now**.
- Adrian's age is **three times** Harriet's age.
- Harriet is **half** the age of Zack.

---

### **Step 2: Find Adrian's age**

Adrian's age = 3 × Harriet's age  
= 3 × 21 = **63 years**

---

### **Step 3: Find Zack's age**

Harriet is half the age of Zack, so:

Zack's age = 2 × Harriet's age  
= 2 × 21 = **42 years**

---

### **Step 4: Calculate their ages in 3 years**

- Harriet in 3 years = 21 + 3 = **24**
- Adrian in 3 years = 63 + 3 = **66**
- Zack in 3 years = 42 + 3 = **45**

---

### **Step 5: Find the average age in 3 years**

Average age = (Sum of their ages in 3 years) ÷ 3  
= (24 + 66 + 45) ÷ 3  
= **135 ÷ 3** = **45**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The average age of the three in three years will be 45.**
We are given the following information:

- **Total points scored by four students**: 251  
- **Naomi scored**: 68 points  
- **Yuri scored**: 10 more than half as many points as Naomi  
- **Brianna scored**: 17 points more than Naomi  
- We are to find: **Jojo's score**

---

### Step 1: Write down what we know

Let’s define:

- **Naomi** = 68 points  
- **Yuri** = (1/2 × Naomi) + 10  
- **Brianna** = Naomi + 17  
- **Jojo** = ?

Total score of all four students = 251

So:

$$
\text{Naomi} + \text{Yuri} + \text{Brianna} + \text{Jojo} = 251
$$

---

### Step 2: Plug in the known values

First, calculate Yuri and Brianna's scores.

#### Yuri:
$$
\text{Yuri} = \frac{1}{2} \times 68 + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44
$$

#### Brianna:
$$
\text{Brianna} = 68 + 17 = 85
$$

Now plug into the total:

$$
\text{Naomi} + \text{Yuri} + \text{Brianna} + \text{Jojo} = 251
$$
$$
68 + 44 + 85 + \text{Jojo} = 251
$$

Add the known scores:

$$
68 + 44 = 112  
112 + 85 = 197
$$

So:

$$
197 + \text{Jojo} = 251
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for Jojo

$$
\text{Jojo} = 251 - 197 = 54
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Jojo scored 54 points.**

Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Initial amount of water in the tank:**  
   $ 120 $ liters

2. **Celine used 90 liters to water her garden:**  
   $ 120 - 90 = 30 $ liters left in the tank.

3. **She collected rainwater that is twice as much as what was left:**  
   $ 2 \times 30 = 60 $ liters of rainwater collected.

4. **Total water in the tank now:**  
   $ 30 + 60 = 90 $ liters

### ✅ Final Answer: **90 liters**
Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Geraniums:** Andy plants **90** geraniums.

2. **Petunias:** He plants **40 fewer** petunias than geraniums.  
   So, the number of petunias is:  
   $$
   90 - 40 = 50
   $$

3. **Total flowers:** Add the number of geraniums and petunias together:  
   $$
   90 + 50 = 140

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **First year's advertising cost**:  
   The company spends **$15,000** on advertising in the first year.

2. **Second year's advertising cost**:  
   The company spends **a third of that amount**, which means:  
   $$
   \frac{1}{3} \times 15,000 = 5,000
   $$

3. **Total spending over two years**:  
   Add the amounts from both years:  
   $$
   15,000 + 5,000 = 20,000
   $$

Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of days to travel **by bus**
- It takes **6 days** to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus.

### Step 2: Determine the number of days to travel **by car**
- It takes **half as many days** as by bus.
- So, car travel time = $ \frac{6}{2} = 3 $ days.

### Step 3: Calculate total travel time
Andrew plans to:
- Go **to Rochester by bus**: 6 days  
- Return **from Rochester by car**: 3 days  

So, total travel time is:
$$
6 + 3 = 9 \text{ days}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**9 days**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial counts of each type**

- Fire type cards = 30  
- Grass type cards = 20  
- Water type cards = 40  

---

### **Step 2: Adjust for the changes**

- **Water type cards lost**: 8  
  - New water count = 40 - 8 = **32**
- **Grass type cards bought**: 14  
  - New grass count = 20 + 14 = **34**

---

### **Step 3: Total number of cards now**

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Fire} + \text{Grass} + \text{Water} = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96
$$

---

### **Step 4: Probability of picking a water type card**

$$
\text{Probability (water)} = \frac{\text{Number of water cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} = \frac{32}{96}
$$

Now, simplify or convert to percentage:

$$
\frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333
$$

Convert to percentage:

$$
0.3333 \times 100 = 33.33\%
$$

---

### **Step 5: Round to the nearest integer**

$$
33.33\% \rightarrow \boxed{33\%}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**33%** chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type.
Let's break down the cost step by step:

### 1. **Base burrito**  
- $6.50

### 2. **Add-ons:**
- Extra meat: $2.00  
- Extra cheese: $1.00  
- Avocado: $1.00  
- 2 sauces at $0.25 each:  
  $ 2 × $0.25 = $0.50  

**Total add-ons:**  
$2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = **$4.50**

### 3. **Upgrade (chips and drink):**  
- $3.00

### 4. **Total cost before gift card:**  
$6.50 (base) + $4.50 (add-ons) + $3.00 (upgrade) = **$14.00**

### 5. **Gift card used:**  
- $5.00

### 6. **Amount still owed:**  
$14.00 - $5.00 = **$9.00**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$9.00**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the puzzle pieces per minute for each person**

- **Kalinda** can place **4 pieces per minute**.
- **Her mom** can place **half as many as Kalinda**, so:
  
  $$
  \text{Mom's rate} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ pieces per minute}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Find their combined rate**

$$
\text{Combined rate} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ pieces per minute}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how long it takes to complete the puzzle**

Total number of puzzle pieces = **360**

Time (in minutes) = Total pieces ÷ Combined rate:

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{360}{6} = 60 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Convert minutes to hours**

$$
60 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{1} \text{ hour}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of watermelons**
The farm produced:

$$
120 \text{ baby watermelons}
$$

---

### **Step 2: First harvest (after two months)**
Ashlyn found that **30%** of the watermelons were ready for harvest. So she took:

$$
30\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36 \text{ watermelons}
$$

So, after the first harvest, the number of **remaining watermelons** is:

$$
120 - 36 = 84 \text{ watermelons}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Second harvest (two weeks later)**
She came back and found that **3/4 of the remaining melons** were ready for harvest.

So, the number of watermelons harvested the second time is:

$$
\frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \text{ watermelons}
$$

So, the number of **watermelons not ready** after the second harvest is:

$$
84 - 63 = 21 \text{ watermelons}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{21} \text{ watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much Mark pays for everything.

---

### **Step 1: Total cost of the cars**

Mark buys **12 cars**, each costing **$20,000**.

$$
\text{Total car cost} = 12 \times 20,000 = \$240,000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Tax on the cars (10%)**

He pays **10% tax** on the total cost of the cars.

$$
\text{Tax} = 0.10 \times 240,000 = \$24,000
$$

---

### **Step 3: Registration fees**

He also pays **$1,000 registration fee per car**.

$$
\text{Registration total} = 12 \times 1,000 = \$12,000
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total amount paid**

Now add up all the costs:

$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{Car cost} + \text{Tax} + \text{Registration}
$$
$$
\text{Total cost} = 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = \boxed{\$276,000}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Mark pays a total of \$276,000 for everything.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Find out how many shells Robert collected on Monday.
We're told:
- Robert collects **20 shells** on Monday.

### Step 2: Find out how many shells Kylie collected on Monday.
We're told:
- Kylie collects **5 more shells than Robert** on Monday.

So, Kylie's shells on Monday = Robert's shells + 5  
= 20 + 5 = **25 shells**

### Step 3: Find out how many shells Kylie collects on Tuesday.
We're told:
- On Tuesday, Kylie collects **2 times more shells than she did on Monday**.

So, Kylie's shells on Tuesday = 2 × (Kylie's shells on Monday)  
= 2 × 25 = **50 shells**

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Kylie collects 50 shells on Tuesday.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of ants**:  
   We are told there are **50 ants**.

2. **Number of bugs**:  
   It is stated that Dax found **half as many bugs as ants**.  
   So, the number of bugs = $ \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 $.

3. **Total number of insects**:  
   Insects include both ants and bugs.  
   So, total insects = number of ants + number of bugs  
   = $ 50 + 25 = 75 $.

### ✅ Final Answer: **75 insects** in the garden.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of penguins
We are told there are **36 penguins** sunbathing in the snow.

### Step 2: One-third jump into the ocean
One-third of the penguins jump into the ocean:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
$$

So, **12 penguins** jump into the ocean.

### Step 3: Another one-third go inside the cave
Another one-third of the original 36 penguins go inside the cave:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
$$

So, **12 penguins** go inside the cave.

### Step 4: Total number of penguins that left
Now we add the number of penguins that left:

$$
12 \text{ (jumped in ocean)} + 12 \text{ (went to cave)} = 24
$$

### Step 5: Number of penguins still sunbathing
Subtract the number of penguins that left from the total:

$$
36 - 24 = 12
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**12 penguins** are still left sunbathing.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many tomato vines Steve needs.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many tomatoes Steve eats per day**
We're told:
- Steve eats **6 tomatoes per day**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many tomatoes Steve's girlfriend eats per day**
We're told:
- Steve eats **twice as much** as his girlfriend.

So, if Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, then his girlfriend eats:

$$
\frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total tomatoes eaten per day by both of them**
$$
6 \text{ (Steve)} + 3 \text{ (Girlfriend)} = 9 \text{ tomatoes per day}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Determine how many tomatoes are needed per week**
There are 7 days in a week, so:

$$
9 \text{ tomatoes/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Determine how many tomatoes one vine produces per week**
We're told:
- A vine produces **3 tomatoes per week**

---

### **Step 6: Calculate how many vines are needed**
To get 63 tomatoes per week, and each vine produces 3 tomatoes:

$$
\frac{63}{3} = 21 \text{ vines}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Steve needs **21 tomato vines**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of people
John + 20 friends = **21 people**

### Step 2: Slices per person
Each person gets **4 slices**.

So, total number of slices needed:
$$
21 \text{ people} \times 4 \text{ slices/person} = 84 \text{ slices}
$$

### Step 3: Slices per pizza
Each pizza is cut into **8 slices**.

### Step 4: Number of pizzas needed
To find how many pizzas are needed to get at least 84 slices:

$$
\frac{84}{8} = 10.5
$$

Since you can't order half a pizza, John needs to round **up** to the next whole number.

### ✅ Final Answer:
**11 pizzas** are needed.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Purchase**

Ram buys **25 pens**.

So, he starts with:

> ✅ **25 pens**

---

### **Step 2: Using the Pens**

He uses them one by one until the ink runs out. When a pen runs out of ink, it becomes **empty**.

Assume that each pen is used completely before being discarded as empty. So, after using all 25 pens, he has:

> ✅ **25 empty pens**

---

### **Step 3: Recycling Empty Pens**

Ram discovered that he can **mix the ink from 5 empty pens to make 1 new full pen**.

So, with 25 empty pens, how many new pens can he make?

$$
\frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ new pens}
$$

Now he has:

> ✅ **5 new pens**

These are **full** pens again, so he can use them.

---

### **Step 4: Repeat the Process**

He now uses these 5 new pens, which will run out and become **empty** again.

So now he has:

> ✅ **5 empty pens**

Again, he can make more pens by mixing:

$$
\frac{5}{5} = 1 \text{ new pen}
$$

Now he has:

> ✅ **1 new pen**

---

### **Step 5: Final Use**

He uses that last pen, and it becomes **empty** again.

So now he has:

> ✅ **1 empty pen**

But he doesn't have enough empty pens (only 1) to make another pen (needs 5), so the process stops here.

---

### **Final Count: Total Pens He Has**

Let’s count **all the pens he ever had**, including both the ones he used and the ones he made:

- **Initial purchase:** 25 pens  
- **From recycling:** 5 + 1 = 6 pens  
- **Total pens:** 25 + 6 = **31 pens**

---

### ✅ **Answer: 31 pens**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Johnny's initial allowance**:  
   He starts with **$20**.

2. **He adds an extra $10**:  
   So, he now has:  
   $$
   20 + 10 = 30
   $$

3. **He invests this sum**:  
   The total amount invested is **$30**.

4. **The investment triples in a year**:  
   Tripling means multiplying by 3:  
   $$
   30 \times 3 = 90
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{90}
$$

So, after one year, Johnny had **$90**.
Let's solve this step by step.

We are given:

1. **Jessa is 20 years old.**
2. **Joan is five years older than Jessa.**
3. **Mary is two years younger than Joan.**

---

### Step 1: Find Joan's age

Joan is 5 years older than Jessa:

$$
\text{Joan} = \text{Jessa} + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25
$$

---

### Step 2: Find Mary's age

Mary is 2 years younger than Joan:

$$
\text{Mary} = \text{Joan} - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23
$$

---

### Step 3: Add their ages together

$$
\text{Sum of the ages} = \text{Jessa} + \text{Joan} + \text{Mary} = 20 + 25 + 23 = 68
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{68}
$$
We are given:

- Total number of students in the hall = **1000**
- 30% of the students went out through **exit A**
- Then, **3/5** of the **remaining** students went out through **exit B**
- The **rest** went out through **exit C**

We need to find how many students went out through **exit C**.

---

### Step 1: Students who left through exit A

30% of 1000 students went out through exit A:

$$
\text{Students through A} = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
$$

Remaining students after A:
$$
1000 - 300 = 700
$$

---

### Step 2: Students who left through exit B

3/5 of the remaining 700 students went through exit B:

$$
\text{Students through B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
$$

Remaining students after B:
$$
700 - 420 = 280
$$

---

### Step 3: Students who left through exit C

The rest of the students (after A and B) went through exit C:

$$
\text{Students through C} = 280
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{280}
$$

**280 students went out through exit C.**
We are given the following information:

1. **James has 6 more candies than Robert.**
2. **John has twice as many candies as Robert.**
3. **John has 54 candies.**

We are asked: **How many more candies does John have than James?**

---

### Step 1: Find how many candies Robert has

From the second statement:
> John has twice as many candies as Robert.

So,  
$$
\text{John's candies} = 2 \times \text{Robert's candies}
$$

Given that John has **54** candies:
$$
2 \times \text{Robert's candies} = 54
$$

Divide both sides by 2:
$$
\text{Robert's candies} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many candies James has

From the first statement:
> James has 6 more candies than Robert.

So,
$$
\text{James's candies} = \text{Robert's candies} + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33

John has **21 more candies** than James.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the initial number of books
- **Dolly** has **2 books**
- **Pandora** has **1 book**

So, together, they have:
$$
2 + 1 = 3 \text{ books}
$$

---

### Step 2: Understand what it means to "read each other's books as well as their own"

This means:
- Dolly reads her **own 2 books**, and also reads **Pandora's 1 book**
- Pandora reads her **own 1 book**, and also reads **Dolly's 2 books**

So, we need to count how many **unique books** are read in total.

---

### Step 3: Count the total number of unique books read

- Dolly reads: 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books  
- Pandora reads: 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books  

But we're asked: **how many books will they collectively read?**

That means we are looking for the **total number of unique books** that are read by either Dolly or Pandora. Since both have access to all 3 books (Dolly’s 2 + Pandora’s 1), and they are reading them, the total number of **unique books read** is:

$$
\boxed{3}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{3}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many pen pals Mike still has**

Mike had **5** pen pals.  
He stopped being a pen pal with **2** of them.  
So, he now has:

$$
5 - 2 = 3 \text{ pen pals}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many letters each pen pal sends per week**

Each pen pal sends **2 letters per week**, and each letter is **5 pages long**.

So, each pen pal sends:

$$
2 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 10 \text{ pages/week}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total number of pages Mike writes per week**

He has **3 pen pals**, and each sends **10 pages** per week.

So, total pages Mike writes per week is:

$$
3 \text{ pen pals} \times 10 \text{ pages/pen pal} = 30 \text{ pages/week}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Time to write each page**

Mike can write **1 page every 6 minutes**.

So, time to write 30 pages is:

$$
30 \text{ pages} \times 6 \text{ minutes/page} = 180 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Convert minutes to hours**

$$
180 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Mike spends 3 hours writing per week.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Total minutes in the phone plan:**
Jason has a **1000-minute** phone plan per month.

### 2. **Minutes used for calls with his boss:**
- He has a **15-minute call** with his boss **every day**.
- This month has **30 days**, so:
  
  $$
  15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes}
  $$

### 3. **Extra minutes used for other calls:**
- Jason has used **300 extra minutes** for calls to other people.

### 4. **Total minutes used:**
$$
450 \text{ (boss)} + 300 \text{ (others)} = 750 \text{ minutes}
$$

### 5. **Minutes left:**
$$
1000 \text{ (total plan)} - 750 \text{ (used)} = 250 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jason has 250 minutes left.**
We are given a series of events involving the number of french fries Griffin had, and we need to find **how many fries Ginger gave Griffin**.

---

### Step 1: Start with what Griffin originally had
Griffin had **24 french fries**.

---

### Step 2: Kyle took 5 fries
- Fries left with Griffin:  
  $$
  24 - 5 = 19
  $$

---

### Step 3: Billy took twice as many as Kyle
- Kyle took 5, so Billy took:  
  $$
  2 \times 5 = 10
  $$
- Fries left with Griffin:  
  $$
  19 - 10 = 9
  $$

---

### Step 4: Ginger gives Griffin some fries
Let’s call the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin **$ x $**.

So now Griffin has:
$$
9 + x
$$

---

### Step 5: Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number Kyle had taken
- Kyle took 5, so Colby took:  
  $$
  5 - 3 = 2
  $$
- So Griffin loses 2 more fries.
- Fries left with Griffin after Colby takes 2:  
  $$
  (9 + x) - 2 = 7 + x
  $$

---

### Step 6: Final amount of fries Griffin has is 27
So:
$$
7 + x = 27
$$

Solve for $ x $:
$$
x = 27 - 7 = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{20}
$$

Ginger gave Griffin **20 french fries**.
We are given:

- Aquarium 1 has **4 snails**.
- Aquarium 2 has **32 snails**.
- The **difference** between the number of snails in the two aquariums is **twice the amount of fish in both aquariums**.
- Both aquariums have the **same number of fish**.

Let’s define:

- Let $ f $ be the number of **fish in each aquarium** (since they are the same).

---

### Step 1: Find the difference in snails

$$
\text{Difference in snails} = 32 - 4 = 28
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the given relationship

The problem says:

> "The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums."

So:

$$
\text{Difference in snails} = 2 \times (\text{total number of fish})
$$

Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, total number of fish = $ f + f = 2f $

So:

$$
28 = 2 \times (2f)
$$

$$
28 = 4f
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ f $

$$
f = \frac{28}{4} = 7
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{7}
$$

There are **7 fish in each aquarium**.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much **Jean** paid the makeup artist.

---

### **Step 1: Hourly rate of the makeup artist**
- The makeup artist charges **$250 per hour**.

---

### **Step 2: Time spent on makeup per day**
- It takes **6 hours per day** to do the makeup.

---

### **Step 3: Number of times makeup is done per week**
- She needs it done **4 times a week**.

---

### **Step 4: Total time per week**
- Time per week = 6 hours/day × 4 days/week  
  = **24 hours per week**

---

### **Step 5: Duration of the movie**
- The movie takes **5 weeks** to finish.

---

### **Step 6: Total time for the entire movie**
- Total time = 24 hours/week × 5 weeks  
  = **120 hours total**

---

### **Step 7: Total cost before discount**
- Cost = 120 hours × $250/hour  
  = **$30,000**

---

### **Step 8: Apply the 10% discount**
- Discount = 10% of $30,000  
  = 0.10 × 30,000 = **$3,000**

- Final amount Jean pays = $30,000 - $3,000 = **$27,000**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**Jean paid $27,000.**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Add up all the costs
Isabelle spent money on several items:

- **Cake ingredients:** $12  
- **Birthday presents:** $43  
- **Decorations:** $15  
- **Invitations:** $4  
- **Goodie bags:** $22  

Now, add these amounts together:

$$
12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96
$$

So, the **total cost** of the party supplies is **$96**.

---

### Step 2: Split the cost evenly among three people (Isabelle and her two parents)

$$
\frac{96}{3} = 32
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Each person paid $32.**
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Find the total weight of the onions:**

   The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds.

   $$
   4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   $$

2. **Calculate the total cost:**

   Each pound of onions costs $1.50.

   $$
   200 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.50 \text{ per pound} = \$300
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The chef spent $300.**
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the information given**

- **Sister's cookie consumption:**
  - Monday: 5 cookies
  - Tuesday: 13 cookies

- **Sue's cookie consumption:**
  - **Monday:** Sue ate **4 times** as many cookies as her sister.
  - **Tuesday:** Sue ate **twice** as many cookies as her sister.

- **Each cookie has 200 calories.**

We are asked to find how many **more calories** Sue consumed than her sister over the two days.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate Sue’s cookie consumption**

#### **Monday:**
- Sister ate 5 cookies
- Sue ate:  
  $$
  4 \times 5 = 20 \text{ cookies}
  $$

#### **Tuesday:**
- Sister ate 13 cookies
- Sue ate:  
  $$
  2 \times 13 = 26 \text{ cookies}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Total cookies eaten by each person**

#### **Sister:**
$$
5 + 13 = 18 \text{ cookies}
$$

#### **Sue:**
$$
20 + 26 = 46 \text{ cookies}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Convert cookies to calories**

Each cookie = 200 calories

#### **Sister's total calories:**
$$
18 \times 200 = 3600 \text{ calories}
$$

#### **Sue's total calories:**
$$
46 \times 200 = 9200 \text{ calories}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Find the difference in calories**

$$
9200 - 3600 = 5600 \text{ calories}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{5600} \text{ more calories}
$$

Sue consumed **5600 more calories** than her sister.
We are given the following information:

- Each class has **20 students**.
- There are **3 classes**.
- The school as a whole is **50% boys and 50% girls**, so there are equal numbers of boys and girls in total.
- The **first class has 15 girls**.
- The **second class has 12 girls**.
- We are to find how many **boys are in the third class**.

---

### Step 1: Total number of students

Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes:

$$
\text{Total students} = 3 \times 20 = 60
$$

Since the school is 50% boys and 50% girls:

$$
\text{Total boys} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \\
\text{Total girls} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
$$

---

### Step 2: Find number of girls in each class

- First class: 15 girls  
- Second class: 12 girls  
- Third class: Let’s call this $ G_3 $

So total number of girls is:

$$
15 + 12 + G_3 = 30
$$

Solve for $ G_3 $:

$$
G_3 = 30 - (15 + 12) = 30 - 27 = 3
$$

So the third class has **3 girls**.

---

### Step 3: Find number of boys in the third class

Each class has 20 students. So in the third class:

$$
\text{Number of boys in third class} = 20 - \text{number of girls} = 20 - 3 = 17
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{17}
$$

There are **17 boys** in the third class.
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Start with the original number of apps:**  
   Travis had **61 apps** on his tablet.

2. **He deleted 9 apps:**  
   So we subtract 9 from 61:  
   $ 61 - 9 = 52 $

3. **Then he downloaded 18 more apps:**  
   Now we add 18 to the remaining 52:  
   $ 52 + 18 = 70 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **70 apps** are on Travis's tablet now.
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the information given**

- **Last night**:
  - Rick killed **10 wolves** and **15 cougars**.
  
- **Today**:
  - He killed **three times as many wolves as cougars**.
  - He killed **three fewer cougars than the previous night** (i.e., last night he killed 15 cougars, so today he killed **15 - 3 = 12 cougars**).

---

### **Step 2: Find the number of wolves killed today**

We are told that **today**, Rick killed **three times as many wolves as cougars**.

He killed **12 cougars** today.

So:

$$
\text{Wolves today} = 3 \times \text{Cougars today} = 3 \times 12 = 36
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total animals killed**

Now, we add up all the animals killed:

- **Last night**:
  - Wolves: 10
  - Cougars: 15
  - Total: $10 + 15 = 25$

- **Today**:
  - Wolves: 36
  - Cougars: 12
  - Total: $36 + 12 = 48$

- **Total animals killed overall**:
  $$
  25 + 48 = \boxed{73}
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{73}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Bill starts on the 3rd floor.**

2. **He rides the elevator up to a floor that is equal to:**
   $$
   4 \times (\text{starting floor}) + 6
   $$

3. **Substitute the starting floor (3) into the equation:**
   $$
   4 \times 3 + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18
   $$

4. **So, Bill ends up on the 18th floor.**

### ✅ Final Answer: **18th floor**
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many times Anne went down the slide.

Mitchel went down the slide **30 times**.  
Anne went down the slide **30% less** than Mitchel.

So, we calculate 30% of 30:
$$
30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9
$$

Now subtract that from 30 to find how many times Anne went down:
$$
30 - 9 = 21
$$

✅ **Anne went down the slide 21 times.**

---

### Step 2: Determine how many times Robert went down the slide.

Robert went down the slide **4 times as much as Anne**.

So,
$$
4 \times 21 = 84
$$

✅ **Robert went down the slide 84 times.**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Robert went down the water slide 84 times.**
We are given the following information:

- There are **10 stalls**, each with **20 cows**.
- Mr. Sylas buys **40 cows** and divides them **equally** among the **20 stalls**.

We are asked: **How many cows are in 8 of the stalls?**

---

### Step 1: Total number of cows initially

Each stall has 20 cows, and there are 10 stalls:

$$
10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ cows}
$$

---

### Step 2: Mr. Sylas adds 40 cows

He buys **40 cows** and divides them **equally** among the **20 stalls**.

So, each stall gets:

$$
\frac{40}{20} = 2 \text{ cows per stall}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total number of cows after adding

Now each stall has:

$$
20 + 2 = 22 \text{ cows}
$$

So total number of cows is:

$$
10 \times 22 = 220 \text{ cows}
$$

But we only need to find how many cows are in **8 of the stalls**.

---

### Step 4: Cows in 8 stalls

Since each stall now has **22 cows**, then:

$$
8 \times 22 = 176 \text{ cows}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{176}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much money Brady has in total.

---

### Step 1: Count the value of each type of coin/bill

- **Pennies**:  
  Brady has **100 pennies**.  
  Each penny is worth **$0.01**.  
  So,  
  $$
  100 \times 0.01 = 1.00 \text{ dollar}
  $$

- **Nickels**:  
  Brady has **40 nickels**.  
  Each nickel is worth **$0.05**.  
  So,  
  $$
  40 \times 0.05 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
  $$

- **Dimes**:  
  Brady has **20 dimes**.  
  Each dime is worth **$0.10**.  
  So,  
  $$
  20 \times 0.10 = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
  $$

- **Dollar bills**:  
  Brady has **40 dollar bills**.  
  Each bill is worth **$1.00**.  
  So,  
  $$
  40 \times 1.00 = 40.00 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Add up all the amounts

$$
1.00 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 40.00 = 45.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$45.00}
$$

Brady has **\$45.00** in his piggy bank.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the total number of 10-foot sections in the tree**

The redwood is **200 feet tall**, and each section is **10 feet** long.

$$
\text{Number of sections} = \frac{200}{10} = 20
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the weight of one section**

Each 10-foot section weighs **400 pounds**.

$$
\text{Weight per section} = 400 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total weight before termite damage**

$$
\text{Total weight before damage} = 20 \times 400 = 8000 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate how much wood was eaten by termites**

Termites ate **30%** of the wood:

$$
\text{Weight lost to termites} = 0.30 \times 8000 = 2400 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Subtract the weight lost from the original weight**

$$
\text{Remaining weight} = 8000 - 2400 = 5600 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{5600} \text{ pounds}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step:

### 1. **Cost per book**
Nancy owes **$0.50** for each of the **8 books**.

So, the cost for the books is:
$$
8 \times 0.50 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

### 2. **Flat fee**
She also has to pay a **flat $2.00 fee** because she has at least one book that's over a week overdue.

### 3. **Total cost**
Now, add the two amounts together:
$$
4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Nancy has to pay $6.00 total.**
We are given the following information:

1. **Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.**
2. **Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.**
3. **Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.**
4. **Andrea has 52 apples.**

We are to find the **total number of fruits** (apples + bananas) that Andrea and Jamal have altogether.

---

### Step 1: Use the fact that Andrea has 52 apples

From statement (1):  
> Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.

So if Andrea has 52 apples, then:

$$
\text{Jamal's apples} = 52 - 8 = 44
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the fact that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples

From statement (3):  
> Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.

So:

$$
\text{Jamal's bananas} = \text{Jamal's apples} + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48
$$

---

### Step 3: Use the fact that Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal

From statement (2):  
> Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.

So:

$$
\text{Andrea's bananas} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Jamal's bananas} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
$$

---

### Step 4: Add up all the fruits

- **Andrea's apples:** 52  
- **Andrea's bananas:** 24  
- **Jamal's apples:** 44  
- **Jamal's bananas:** 48  

$$
\text{Total fruits} = 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 = 168
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{168}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the ratio
We are told that **2 cups of flour** are needed to make **a dozen cookies** (which is 12 cookies).

So, the amount of flour per cookie is:

$$
\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{12 \text{ cookies}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ cup per cookie}
$$

### Step 2: Calculate total number of cookies
Carla is making:
- 36 cookies today
- 30 cookies tomorrow

Total cookies =  
$$
36 + 30 = 66 \text{ cookies}
$$

### Step 3: Calculate total cups of flour needed
Since each cookie requires $\frac{1}{6}$ cup of flour:

$$
66 \text{ cookies} \times \frac{1}{6} \text{ cup per cookie} = \frac{66}{6} = 11 \text{ cups}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Carla will need 11 cups of flour.**
We are given:

- There are **9,300 pennies** in the cup.
- We need to find the total dollar amount of **two-thirds** of these pennies.

---

### Step 1: Find two-thirds of the number of pennies

$$
\frac{2}{3} \times 9,300 = ?
$$

First, divide 9,300 by 3:

$$
9,300 \div 3 = 3,100
$$

Now multiply by 2:

$$
3,100 \times 2 = 6,200
$$

So, **two-thirds of the pennies = 6,200 pennies**

---

### Step 2: Convert pennies to dollars

Since **1 penny = $0.01**, we multiply:

$$
6,200 \times 0.01 = 62
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\$62}
$$
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box.**  
   So, the total number of marbles she has initially is:  
   $$
   5 \times 50 = 250
   $$

2. **She gets 20 more marbles from her friend.**  
   So, we add those 20 marbles to the 250 she already has:  
   $$
   250 + 20 = 270
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **270 marbles**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many trees Chris has
Chris has **6 trees**.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many trees Ferdinand has
Ferdinand has **half the number of trees that Chris has**:

$$
\text{Ferdinand's trees} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine how many trees Harry has
Harry has **5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has**:

$$
\text{Harry's trees} = 2 \times 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11
$$

---

### Step 4: Find how many more trees Harry has than Ferdinand
$$
\text{Difference} = \text{Harry's trees} - \text{Ferdinand's trees} = 11 - 3 = 8
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{8}
$$

Harry has **8 more trees** than Ferdinand.
Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Carmen has $100.**

2. **Samantha has $25 more than Carmen:**
   $$
   100 + 25 = 125
   $$
   So, Samantha has **$125**.

3. **Daisy has $50 more than Samantha:**
   $$
   125 + 50 = 175
   $$
   So, Daisy has **$175**.

4. **Now, add up the amounts that all three girls have:**
   $$
   100 + 125 + 175 = 400
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$400**
Let's break this down step by step to find how much more the **total price** of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's **budget**.

---

### **Step 1: Selling Price of the House**
The selling price is:
$$
\$350{,}000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Brokerage Fee (5% of selling price)**
$$
\text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \times 350{,}000 = 0.05 \times 350{,}000 = \$17{,}500
$$

---

### **Step 3: Transfer Fee (12% of selling price)**
$$
\text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \times 350{,}000 = 0.12 \times 350{,}000 = \$42{,}000
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total Cost**
Add up all the costs:
$$
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
$$
$$
= 350{,}000 + 17{,}500 + 42{,}000 = \$409{,}500
$$

---

### **Step 5: Compare with Budget**
Mrs. Cruz's budget is:
$$
\$400{,}000
$$

So, the total cost is:

**The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.**
Let's calculate Mr. Tan's **net proceeds** from selling the house step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Selling Price**
The selling price of the house is:

$$
\$400{,}000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Transfer Fees (3% of selling price)**

$$
\text{Transfer fees} = 3\% \times 400{,}000 = 0.03 \times 400{,}000 = \$12{,}000
$$

---

### **Step 3: Brokerage Fee (5% of selling price)**

$$
\text{Brokerage fee} = 5\% \times 400{,}000 = 0.05 \times 400{,}000 = \$20{,}000
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total Deductions**

Add up all the expenses:

$$
\text{Total deductions} = 12{,}000 + 20{,}000 = \$32{,}000
$$

---

### **Step 5: Remaining Loan Payment**

Mr. Tan also paid:

$$
\$250{,}000
$$

to settle the remaining loan.

---

### **Step 6: Net Proceeds**

Now subtract all deductions and the loan payment from the selling price:

$$
\text{Net proceeds} = 400{,}000 - 32{,}000 - 250{,}000 = \$118{,}000
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$118{,}000}
$$

This is Mr. Tan's **net proceeds** from selling the house.
Let's break this down step by step to find the total time from **starting the oil** to **having cooked the chicken**.

---

### Step 1: Time to heat oil to 300°F
- It takes **20 minutes** for the oil to heat up to 300°F.

---

### Step 2: Time to heat oil from 300°F to 400°F
- It takes **40% longer** than the first 20 minutes.
- 40% of 20 minutes =  
  $$
  0.4 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes}
  $$
- So, the time to heat from 300°F to 400°F is:
  $$
  20 + 8 = 28 \text{ minutes}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Total time to warm the oil to 400°F
- Time to heat to 300°F: 20 minutes  
- Time to heat from 300°F to 400°F: 28 minutes  
- **Total warming time** =  
  $$
  20 + 28 = 48 \text{ minutes}
  $$

---

### Step 4: Cooking time
- It takes **5 minutes less** than the time it took to warm the oil.
- So, cooking time =  
  $$
  48 - 5 = 43 \text{ minutes}
  $$

---

### Step 5: Total time from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken
- Warming time: 48 minutes  
- Cooking time: 43 minutes  
- **Total time** =  
  $$
  48 + 43 = \boxed{91} \text{ minutes}
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{91 \text{ minutes}}

1. **First bag**:  
   Mary has **300** M&Ms.

2. **Second bag**:  
   It has **12 more** M&Ms than the first bag.  
   So, second bag = 300 + 12 = **312** M&Ms.

3. **Third bag**:  
   It has a hole and only has **half the number of M&Ms** that the first bag had.  
   Half of 300 = **150** M&Ms.

Now, let's add them all together to find the total number of M&Ms:

$$
300 \ (\text{first bag}) + 312 \ (\text{second bag}) + 150 \ (\text{third bag}) = 762
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **762 M&Ms**

---

### **Step 1: Number of Houses**
John has **2 houses**.

---

### **Step 2: Bedrooms per House**
Each house has **3 bedrooms**.

So, total number of bedrooms across both houses:
$$
2 \text{ houses} \times 3 \text{ bedrooms/house} = 6 \text{ bedrooms}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Windows per Bedroom**
Each bedroom has **2 windows**.

Total number of bedroom windows:
$$
6 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows/bedroom} = 12 \text{ windows}

Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Add up the total cost of the items

- Cocoa: $4.20  
- Laundry: $9.45  
- Pasta: $1.35  

Now add them:

$$
4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65
$$
$$
13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00
$$

So, the **total cost** is **$15.00**.

---

### Step 2: Subtract the total cost from the amount paid

She paid **$20.00**, so:

$$
20.00 - 15.00 = 5.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- Total number of stitches in the **whole sweater**: **1800**
- The **body** of the sweater takes **900 stitches**
- The **collar** takes **a tenth of the body’s stitches**
- The **rosette** takes **twice as many stitches as the collar**
- There are **two sleeves**, and we need to find how many stitches each sleeve takes

---

### **Step 1: Find the number of stitches for the collar**

The collar takes a tenth of the body’s stitches:

$$
\text{Collar} = \frac{1}{10} \times 900 = 90 \text{ stitches}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the number of stitches for the rosette**

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar:

$$
\text{Rosette} = 2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ stitches}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add up the known parts**

So far, we have:

- Body: 900 stitches  
- Collar: 90 stitches  
- Rosette: 180 stitches  

Total so far:

$$
900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \text{ stitches}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Subtract from total to find the remaining stitches (for the two sleeves)**

Total stitches in the sweater: 1800  
Stitches used in body, collar, and rosette: 1170

$$
\text{Remaining stitches} = 1800 - 1170 = 630 \text{ stitches}
$$

These remaining stitches go to the **two sleeves**.

---

### **Step 5: Divide by 2 to find stitches per sleeve**

$$
\text{Stitches per sleeve} = \frac{630}{2} = 315
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Each sleeve takes **315 stitches**.

She also bought **80 packets** of celery seeds, and each packet costs **$30**.

$$
\text{Cost of celery seeds} = 80 \times 30 = 2400
$$

### Step 3: Add both amounts to find the total cost

$$
\text{Total cost} = 800 + 2400 = 3200
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Mrs. Rylan used **$3200** to buy the seeds.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many lines Sean has to memorize.

---

### **1. Solo Song:**

- All of these are part of what Sean has to memorize.
  
✅ **Lines from the solo song = 54**

---

### **2. First Scene:**
- The first scene has **twice the number of lines** as the solo song.
  - So, lines in the first scene = $ 2 \times 54 = 108 $
- Only **a third of them are his lines**.
  - His lines in the first scene = $ \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 $

✅ **Lines from the first scene = 36**

---

### **3. Second Scene:**
- The second scene has **six more lines than the song**.
  - Lines in the second scene = $ 54 + 6 = 60 $
- **Four-fifths of them are his lines**.
  - His lines in the second scene = $ \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 $

✅ **Lines from the second scene = 48**

---

### **Total Lines to Memorize:**

Now, add up all the lines Sean has to memorize:

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Solo Song} + \text{First Scene} + \text{Second Scene}
$$

$$
\text{Total} = 54 + 36 + 48 = \boxed{138}
$$

---

### ✅ **Answer: Sean has to memorize 138 lines.**
We are given that Carly had **80 cards**. We need to determine how many of these cards had the letter **D** on them.

Let's break this down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Cards with the letter A

- $ \frac{2}{5} $ of the cards had the letter A.
- So, number of cards with A =  
  $$
  \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32
  $$

So, **32 cards** had the letter A.

---

### Step 2: Remaining cards after removing A

Total cards = 80  
Cards with A = 32  
Remaining cards =  
$$
80 - 32 = 48
$$

---

### Step 3: Cards with the letter B

- $ \frac{1}{2} $ of the remaining cards (after A) had the letter B.
- So, number of cards with B =  
  $$
  \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
  $$

So, **24 cards** had the letter B.

---

### Step 4: Remaining cards after removing A and B

Remaining cards =  
$$
48 - 24 = 24
$$

---

### Step 5: Cards with the letter C

- $ \frac{5}{8} $ of the remaining cards (after A and B) had the letter C.
- So, number of cards with C =  
  $$
  \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15
  $$

So, **15 cards** had the letter C.

---

### Step 6: Remaining cards (with D)

Remaining cards =  
$$
24 - 15 = 9
$$

These 9 cards had the letter **D**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{9}
$$

So, **9 cards** had the letter **D** on them.

---

### Step 2: Solve the equation

$$
6S + 9 = 3(S + 9)
$$

Distribute on the right:
$$
6S + 9 = 3S + 27
$$

Subtract $ 3S $ from both sides:
$$
3S + 9 = 27
$$

Subtract 9 from both sides:
$$
3S = 18
$$

Divide by 3:
$$
S = 6
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Sam is currently 6 years old.**

### **Step 1: Understand the speeds**

- The car in the **fast lane** is traveling at **60 miles per hour**.
- The car in the **slow lane** is traveling at **half that speed**, so:

$$
\text{Slow lane speed} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Use the distance formula**

We know that:

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
$$

We are given that both cars travel the **same distance** of **480 miles**. We need to find how long it takes the **slow lane car** to cover that same distance.

Rearranging the formula to solve for time:

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Plug in the values**

$$
\text{Time (slow lane)} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}} = 16 \text{ hours}

\frac{\$5}{10 \text{ minutes}} = \$0.50 \text{ per minute}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how long she works**

She works **between 8 a.m. and 11 a.m.**, which is:

$$
11:00 - 8:00 = 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ minutes}
$$

But she **pauses for half an hour (30 minutes)** in between. So, total time she actually works is:

$$
180 \text{ minutes} - 30 \text{ minutes} = 150 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate her total earnings**

She earns **$0.50 per minute** and works for **150 minutes**:

$$
150 \text{ minutes} \times \$0.50/\text{minute} = \$75
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$75}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Points After 3 Rounds**

We are told:

- **Mike** has **21 points**
- **Jim** has **3 points less than Mike**, so:
  $$
  \text{Jim} = 21 - 3 = 18 \text{ points}
  $$
- **Tony** has **2 times more than Mike**, so:
  $$
  \text{Tony} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \text{ points}
  $$

So, after 3 rounds:

- Mike = 21
- Jim = 18
- Tony = 42

---

### **Step 2: Apply the Extra Points in the Fourth Round**

In the fourth round, **every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points**.

Let’s check each player:

- **Mike**: 21 → over 20 → gets +1 → **22 points**
- **Jim**: 18 → not over 20 → **no extra point** → remains at 18
- **Tony**: 42 → over 20 → gets +1 → **43 points**

---

### **Step 3: Total Points After the Fourth Round**

Now add up their final points:

$$
\text{Total} = 22 + 18 + 43 = 83
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{83}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the ages of the sons

- The **oldest son** is **8 years old**.
- The **youngest son** is **half as old** as the oldest, so:

$$
\text{Youngest son's age} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### Step 2: Total number of oranges washed

Each son washes as many oranges as their age.

- Oldest son (8 years old) washes **8 oranges**
- Youngest son (4 years old) washes **4 oranges**

So, total oranges washed:

$$
8 + 4 = 12 \text{ oranges}
$$

---

### Step 3: Subtract washed oranges from total

Will bought **15 oranges**, and **12 were washed**.

$$
15 - 12 = 3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{3} \text{ oranges are left unwashed.}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find the **total count of activities** Darren did over **two days**.

---

### **Day 1:**

- Pushups: 100  
- Squats: 50  
- Dumbbell presses: 20  

**Total for Day 1:**  
$$
100 + 50 + 20 = 170 \text{ activities}
$$

---

### **Day 2:**

- Pushups: 20 more than Day 1 → $100 + 20 = 120$  
- Squats: 10 fewer than Day 1 → $50 - 10 = 40$  
- Dumbbell presses: double Day 1 → $20 \times 2 = 40$

**Total for Day 2:**  
$$
120 + 40 + 40 = 200 \text{ activities}
$$

---

### **Total for Two Days:**

$$
170 \text{ (Day 1)} + 200 \text{ (Day 2)} = \boxed{370} \text{ activities}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{370}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine daily rice consumption**

- Each person consumes **0.2 kg** of rice per meal.
- There are **5 members** who eat rice every **lunch and dinner**, which is **2 meals per day**.

So, the total daily rice consumption is:

$$
\text{Daily consumption} = 5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/meal}
$$

$$
= 5 \times 2 \times 0.2 = 2 \text{ kg/day}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how many days a 42 kg bag will last**

$$
\text{Number of days} = \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ kg/day}} = 21 \text{ days}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Convert days to weeks**

$$
\text{Number of weeks} = \frac{21 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{3 \text{ weeks}}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out **how many crates Sam was off from his target** for the week.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Target**
Sam's **weekly target** is:
$$
120 \text{ crates}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine How Many Days He Was Open**
He was **closed on Monday and Friday**, so he was open on:
- Tuesday
- Wednesday
- Thursday
- Saturday
- Sunday

That’s **5 days** in total.

---

### **Step 3: Add Up the Crates Sold on Open Days**

We are given:

- **Tuesday:** 15 crates  
- **Wednesday:** 12 crates  
- **Thursday:** 18 crates  
- **Saturday:** 20 crates  
- **Sunday:** (Not mentioned, but we can assume it's included in the weekend sales)

Wait! The problem says:

> "Over the weekend he sold 20 crates."

So that means **Saturday + Sunday = 20 crates**.

So we already have:

- **Weekdays (Tuesday–Thursday):**  
  $15 + 12 + 18 = 45$ crates

- **Weekend (Saturday–Sunday):**  
  $20$ crates

---

### **Step 4: Total Crates Sold That Week**
$$
\text{Total} = 45 \text{ (weekdays)} + 20 \text{ (weekend)} = 65 \text{ crates}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Compare with Target**
Sam's target was **120 crates**, and he only sold **65 crates**.

So, he was **off by**:
$$
120 - 65 = \boxed{55} \text{ crates}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{55} \text{ crates}
$$
We are told that:

- Carmen **accepts the opening bid of $200**.
- The **bids rise by $50 each time**.
- There are **3 other people**, and **each bids once**.
- Carmen **bids after each of the 3 other people**.
- She **eventually wins**.

Let’s break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the bidding sequence

Carmen starts with a bid of **$200**.

Then, **three other people each place one bid**, and **Carmen bids after each of them**.

So the order of bids is:

1. Opening bid: $200 (by someone)
2. Bidder 1: $200 + $50 = **$250**
3. Carmen bids: $250 + $50 = **$300**
4. Bidder 2: $300 + $50 = **$350**
5. Carmen bids: $350 + $50 = **$400**
6. Bidder 3: $400 + $50 = **$450**
7. Carmen bids: $450 + $50 = **$500**

At this point, she has placed **3 bids** after the 3 other bidders.

She wins the desk at her final bid of **$500**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{500}
$$

The desk costs Carmen **$500**.

- On **Sunday**, he exercised for **23 minutes**.

So, the total time on **Monday and Sunday combined** is:
$$
16 + 23 = 39 \text{ minutes}
$$

### Step 2: Peter wants to exercise for **twice** that amount on Tuesday.

So, the time he needs to exercise on Tuesday is:
$$
2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ minutes}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Peter has to exercise for **78 minutes** on Tuesday to reach his goal.
To determine how many **pieces of paper** are used in a **32-page tabloid**, let's break it down step by step.

---

### 📄 Understanding the Tabloid Structure

A **tabloid** (or newspaper) is typically folded into a booklet format. The key idea is that each physical **sheet of paper** can be folded and contains **multiple pages** when printed and folded.

Let’s assume the following:

- The **tabloid** is folded **once vertically** (i.e., folded in half from left to right).
- After folding, the **pages are arranged** so that when you open the folded sheet, you see multiple pages.
- The **page numbers** are arranged in such a way that:
  - Page 1 is on the **left back**
  - Page 2 is on the **left front**
  - Page 31 is on the **right front**
  - Page 32 is on the **right back**

This suggests that the **pages are printed on both sides of the folded sheet**, with **page numbers increasing from the inside out**.

---

### ✅ Step-by-step Breakdown

#### 1. Each Sheet Contains 4 Pages
When you fold a single sheet of paper once (vertically), you get **two panels** (like a booklet). But since the paper is folded and printed on both sides, each **sheet of paper** will contain **4 pages** in total:

- **Front side (outside)**: Pages 1 and 32
- **Back side (inside)**: Pages 2 and 31

So, one sheet = 4 pages.

#### 2. Total Number of Pages = 32
If each sheet holds **4 pages**, then the number of sheets needed is:

$$
\text{Number of Sheets} = \frac{\text{Total Pages}}{\text{Pages per Sheet}} = \frac{32}{4} = 8
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{8}
$$

**Answer:** A 32-page tabloid would use **8 pieces of paper**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial amount**: Annika brought **$50**.

2. **Spent on food and snacks**: She spent **half** of $50 on food and snacks.  
   Half of $50 is:  
   $$
   \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   $$

3. **Additional spending on rides**: She spent an additional **$10** on rides.

4. **Total spent**:  
   $$
   25 + 10 = 35
   $$

5. **Amount left**:  
   $$
   50 - 35 = 15
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$15** is left.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- Total number of books: **250**
- Each book sells for: **$20**
- Elise has been selling for **3 years**
- She sold **twice as many books in the first year** as she has sold in the **current year**
- There are currently **50 unsold books**
- Her sales this year (current year) is: **45 books**

We are asked to find: **Total amount of money she earned in the second year.**

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many books were sold this year**

She sold **45 books** this year.

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many books were sold in the first year**

It’s given that she sold **twice as many books in the first year** as she did this year:

$$
\text{Books sold in first year} = 2 \times 45 = 90
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine how many books have been sold in total so far**

So far, she has sold:

- First year: 90 books  
- This year: 45 books  
- Second year: ? (we don't know yet)

Total books sold = 90 + 45 + (books sold in second year)

Also, we know there are **50 unsold books** remaining from the original 250.

So total books sold = 250 - 50 = **200 books**

---

### **Step 4: Find out how many books were sold in the second year**

Total books sold = 200  
Books sold in first year = 90  
Books sold this year = 45

So books sold in second year =  
$$
200 - 90 - 45 = 65
$$

---

### **Step 5: Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year**

Each book sells for $20, so:

$$
\text{Money earned in second year} = 65 \times 20 = \boxed{1300}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$1300}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much Watson made in April.

---

### **1. Determine the number of workdays in April**
April has **30 days**.  
Assuming Watson works **5 days a week**, we can calculate the number of workdays:

$$
\text{Number of weeks in April} = \frac{30}{7} \approx 4.2857 \text{ weeks}
$$

Since he only works **5 days a week**, we need to figure out how many full weeks and extra days there are in April.

- 4 full weeks = $ 4 \times 5 = 20 $ workdays
- Remaining days: $ 30 - (4 \times 7) = 30 - 28 = 2 $ days

So, Watson worked **22 days** in April.

---

### **2. Calculate his hourly earnings**
Watson earns **$10 per hour** and works **10 hours per day**:

$$
\text{Daily earnings} = 10 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$100 \text{ per day}
$$

$$
\text{Total earnings from hourly wage} = 22 \text{ days} \times \$100 = \$2200
$$

---

### **3. Add the bonus**
He gets a **$300 bonus each week** if the company performs well. Since the company performed very well for the whole month, we assume he got the bonus for **every week he worked**.

We already calculated that he worked **4 full weeks** (since 4 weeks = 28 days, and 22 days is less than that). So:

$$
\text{Bonus} = 4 \times \$300 = \$1200
$$

---

### **4. Total earnings for April**
$$
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Hourly earnings} + \text{Bonus} = \$2200 + \$1200 = \boxed{\$3400}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Watson made \$3400 in April.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total number of people John arm wrestles**:  
   $ 20 $

2. **Percentage of people John beats**:  
   $ 80\% $

3. **Number of people John beats**:  
   $ 80\% \text{ of } 20 = \frac{80}{100} \times 20 = 0.8 \times 20 = 16 $

4. **Number of people John loses to**:  
   Since there are 20 people total and he beat 16, the remaining people are the ones he lost to:  
   $ 20 - 16 = 4 $

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**John lost to 4 people.**
Let's break this problem down step by step:

### Step 1: Total loaves produced per day
The bakery produces **60 loaves** of bread each day.

---

### Step 2: Loaves sold in the morning
Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning:

$$
\frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
$$

So, **40 loaves** are sold in the morning.

---

### Step 3: Loaves left after the morning
Subtract the loaves sold in the morning from the total:

$$
60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves left}
$$

---

### Step 4: Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening
Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. That means:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
$$

These 10 loaves are **split equally** between the afternoon and evening:

$$
\frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{5} \text{ loaves are sold in the afternoon}
$$
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand Joey's weight loss rate**

We're told:

- **Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks.**

So, his **weekly weight loss rate** is:

$$
\frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds per week}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how much weight Sandy wants to lose**

The problem says:

> "Sandy wants to lose as much weight as Joey does."

From Step 1, we know that **Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks**.

So, **Sandy also wants to lose 8 pounds**.

---

### **Step 3: Understand Sandy's weight loss rate**

We’re told:

> "Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week."

From Step 1, Joey loses **2 pounds per week**.

So, Sandy takes **4 weeks to lose 2 pounds**.

That means her **weekly weight loss rate** is:

$$
\frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds per week}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds**

If Sandy loses **0.5 pounds per week**, then to lose **8 pounds**, she will need:

$$
\frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds per week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{16} \text{ weeks}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step:

### 1. **Ice cream tub discount:**
- Original price per tub: $13  
- Discounted price per tub: $11  
- **Savings per tub** = $13 - $11 = **$2**

If you buy **2 tubs**, your total savings from ice cream:
$$
2 \text{ tubs} \times \$2 = \$4
$$

---

### 2. **Milk packet discount:**
- Discount per packet = **$0.5**

If you buy **4 packets**, your total savings from milk:
$$
4 \text{ packets} \times \$0.5 = \$2
$$

---

### 3. **Total savings:**
$$
\$4 \text{ (from ice cream)} + \$2 \text{ (from milk)} = \$6
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$6}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many **new limbs** Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow after **15 days**.

---

### 🧪 The Serum Effects:
- **Extra arm every 3 days**
- **Extra leg every 5 days**

So, we need to figure out **how many times** each of these events happens in **15 days**, and then **add them together** to get the total number of new limbs.

---

### 🔢 Step 1: Count the number of extra arms

An extra arm is added **every 3 days**. So we want to know how many multiples of 3 are in 15 days:

$$
\text{Number of arms} = \left\lfloor \frac{15}{3} \right\rfloor = 5
$$

So, **5 extra arms** will be added.

---

### 🔢 Step 2: Count the number of extra legs

An extra leg is added **every 5 days**. So we want to know how many multiples of 5 are in 15 days:

$$
\text{Number of legs} = \left\lfloor \frac{15}{5} \right\rfloor = 3
$$

So, **3 extra legs** will be added.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Add the number of arms and legs

$$
\text{Total new limbs} = 5 \text{ (arms)} + 3 \text{ (legs)} = 8
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{8}
$$

After **15 days**, Helena’s serum will cause a person to grow **8 new limbs**.
Let's break this problem down step by step.

### Step 1: Total money Theo has
Theo has **$6000** for his trip.

---

### Step 2: Cost of suits
He buys **6 business suits** at **$100 each**:

$$
6 \times 100 = 600
$$

---

### Step 3: Cost of suitcases
He buys **3 suitcases** at **$50 each**:

$$
3 \times 50 = 150
$$

---

### Step 4: Cost of flight ticket
The flight ticket costs **$700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit**.

- Cost of one suit = $100  
- 5 times that = $500  
- Add $700 → $500 + $700 = **$1200**

So, the **flight ticket costs $1200**.

---

### Step 5: Total spent so far
Now, let’s add up all the expenses so far:

- Suits: $600  
- Suitcases: $150  
- Flight ticket: $1200  

$$
600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950
$$

---

### Step 6: Money left after these expenses
Total money: $6000  
Money spent so far: $1950  
Remaining money:

$$
6000 - 1950 = 4050
$$

---

### Step 7: Saving money
Theo wants to **save $2000** for the trip. So we subtract that from the remaining money:

$$
4050 - 2000 = 2050
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Theo has **$2050** left to spend on **gifts for his business partners** in South Africa.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the family composition
- Total number of people in the family = **5**
- **3 people** eat **3 eggs each day**
- The remaining **2 people** eat **2 eggs each day**

---

### Step 2: Calculate daily egg consumption

#### For the 3 people who eat 3 eggs each:
$$
3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ eggs/person} = 9 \text{ eggs}
$$

#### For the 2 people who eat 2 eggs each:
$$
2 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ eggs/person} = 4 \text{ eggs}
$$

#### Total daily egg consumption:
$$
9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs/day}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate weekly egg consumption

Since they eat eggs every day, we multiply the daily amount by 7 (days in a week):

$$
13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs/week}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{91} \text{ eggs per week}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

We are given:

1. **Trent is 5 years older than Jane.**  
   So,  
   $$
   \text{Trent} = \text{Jane} + 5
   $$

2. **Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn.**  
   So,  
   $$
   \text{Jane} = \text{Quinn} - 3
   $$

3. **Quinn is 30 years old.**

---

### Step 1: Find Jane's age
$$
\text{Jane} = \text{Quinn} - 3 = 30 - 3 = 27
$$

### Step 2: Find Trent's age
$$
\text{Trent} = \text{Jane} + 5 = 27 + 5 = 32
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{32}
$$

Trent is **32 years old**.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s define the current age of **Noah** as $ N $, and the current age of **Cera** is given as **46 years**.

We are told:

> "Six years ago, when Noah was half as old as Cera, the population of Chile was half what it is now."

So, let’s look at that time (six years ago):

- Noah’s age then: $ N - 6 $
- Cera’s age then: $ 46 - 6 = 40 $

We are also told:

> "Six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera."

So:

$$
N - 6 = \frac{1}{2}(40)
\Rightarrow N - 6 = 20
\Rightarrow N = 26
$$

So, **Noah is currently 26 years old**.

---

### Step 2: Use the second condition

> "The population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah."

We already found that Noah’s age six years ago was:

$$
26 - 6 = 20
$$

So the population of Chile **six years ago** was:

$$
3000 \times 20 = 60,000
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the current population of Chile

We are told:

> "The population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now."

So if the population six years ago was 60,000, then the current population is:

$$
2 \times 60,000 = 120,000
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{120,000}
$$

So, the **current population of Chile is 120,000**.
We are given the following information about a football team with **105 members**:

1. There are **twice as many players on the offense as on the defense**.
2. There are **half as many players on the special teams as on the defense**.

Let’s define variables for each group:

- Let **D** = number of players on the **defense**.
- Then, **O** = number of players on the **offense** = **2D** (since there are twice as many).
- And **S** = number of players on the **special teams** = **D/2** (since there are half as many).

Now, the total number of players is:

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Defense} + \text{Offense} + \text{Special Teams}
$$

Substitute the expressions in terms of D:

$$
105 = D + 2D + \frac{D}{2}
$$

Now simplify:

$$
105 = D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 3D + \frac{D}{2}
$$

To combine the terms, write them with a common denominator:

$$
3D = \frac{6D}{2}, \quad \text{so} \quad 3D + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{6D}{2} + \frac{D}{2} = \frac{7D}{2}
$$

So we have:

$$
\frac{7D}{2} = 105
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
7D = 210
$$

Divide both sides by 7:

$$
D = 30
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**There are 30 players on the defense.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many people show up for Martha's party.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total number of people invited**

Martha invited:
- 2 families with 6 people each:  
  $ 2 \times 6 = 12 $ people  
- 3 families with 4 people each:  
  $ 3 \times 4 = 12 $ people  

**Total invited:**  
$ 12 + 12 = 24 $ people

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many people couldn't come**

- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.  
- $ \frac{1}{4} $ of that number had previous commitments.  
  So, $ \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 $ people had previous commitments.

**Total people who didn’t come:**  
$ 8 $ (illness) + $ 2 $ (previous commitments) = **10 people**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the number of people who showed up**

**Total invited:** 24  
**Total who didn’t come:** 10  
**People who showed up:**  
$ 24 - 10 = 14 $

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**14 people showed up** for Martha's party.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial number of marbles in the store**
The store originally had:
$$
50 \text{ marbles}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Marbles bought from Johanna**
Solomon bought:
$$
20 \text{ marbles}
$$
from Johanna and added them to the store.

So now the total is:
$$
50 + 20 = 70 \text{ marbles}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Marbles given by his father**
His father gave him:
$$
\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ marbles}
$$

Add these to the total:
$$
70 + 8 = 78 \text{ marbles}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Weight of the marbles**
Each marble weighs:
$$
2 \text{ kg}
$$

So, the total weight is:
$$
78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{156 \text{ kg}}
$$
To find the cost to fill the pool, we need to follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the volume of the pool**

The pool is a rectangular prism (a box shape), so its volume is calculated as:

$$
\text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
$$

Given:
- Length = 6 feet  
- Width = 4 feet  
- Depth = 5 feet  

$$
\text{Volume} = 6 \times 4 \times 5 = 120 \text{ cubic feet}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the cost to fill the pool**

It costs **$0.10 per cubic foot**, so:

$$
\text{Cost} = 120 \times 0.10 = 12 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$12}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

We are told:

- The classroom has **30 boys**.
- There are **3 times as many girls as boys**.
- There are **1/10 as many nongendered children as boys**.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of girls

There are 3 times as many girls as boys:

$$
\text{Number of girls} = 3 \times \text{number of boys} = 3 \times 30 = 90
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the number of nongendered children

There are $ \frac{1}{10} $ as many nongendered children as boys:

$$
\text{Number of nongendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3
$$

---

### Step 3: Add them all up to get the total number of children

$$
\text{Total children} = \text{boys} + \text{girls} + \text{nongendered children}
$$
$$
= 30 + 90 + 3 = 123
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{123}
$$
We are given:

- The **ratio** of electric poles to electric wires is **1:3**.
- The **total number of electric wires** needed is **45**.

We are asked to find the **total number of electric poles** required.

---

### Step 1: Understand the ratio

The ratio **1:3** means that for every **1 pole**, there are **3 wires**.

So, if we let the number of poles be **P**, then the number of wires would be **3P**.

---

### Step 2: Use the given information

We are told the total number of wires is **45**. So:

$$
3P = 45
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for P

$$
P = \frac{45}{3} = 15
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{15}
$$

So, the total number of electric poles required is **15**.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Initial number of people
- Men: 25  
- Women: 15  
- **Total people at the beginning**:  
  $$
  25 + 15 = 40
  $$

### Step 2: After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left
So, the number of people who left is:
$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
$$

That means **10 people left**.

### Step 3: We are told that **22 men stayed**
This means:
$$
25 - 22 = 3 \text{ men left}
$$

### Step 4: Total people who left = 10  
We already know 3 men left. So the rest must be women who left:
$$
10 - 3 = 7 \text{ women left}
$$

### Step 5: Number of women who stayed
Originally there were 15 women. If 7 women left:
$$
15 - 7 = 8
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{8} \text{ women are left}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

1. **The book costs $4.**  
   So,  
   $$
   \text{Book} = \$4
   $$

2. **A magazine costs half as much as a book.**  
   So,  
   $$
   \text{Magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = \$2
   $$

3. **A pen costs $1 less than a magazine.**  
   So,  
   $$
   \text{Pen} = \text{Magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = \$1
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
$$
\boxed{\$1}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the information given

- **Jam has:**
  - 3 boxes of pencils
  - 2 loose pencils
  - Total = **26 pencils**

- **Meg has:**
  - 46 pencils

We are asked: **How many boxes do Jam and Meg need to store all their pencils?**

Assume that **each box holds the same number of pencils**. We need to find how many boxes they would need in total if they combined all their pencils.

---

### Step 2: Find how many pencils are in each box

Jam has 3 boxes and 2 loose pencils, totaling 26 pencils.

So:

$$
\text{Total pencils} = \text{pencils in boxes} + \text{loose pencils}
$$

$$
26 = (\text{number of pencils per box}) \times 3 + 2
$$

Subtract 2 from both sides:

$$
24 = (\text{number of pencils per box}) \times 3
$$

Now divide both sides by 3:

$$
\text{Number of pencils per box} = \frac{24}{3} = 8
$$

✅ So, **each box holds 8 pencils**.

---

### Step 3: Find the total number of pencils

Jam has 26 pencils  
Meg has 46 pencils  

$$
\text{Total pencils} = 26 + 46 = 72
$$

---

### Step 4: Calculate how many boxes are needed for 72 pencils

Since each box holds 8 pencils:

$$
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Jam and Meg need 9 boxes to store all their pencils.**
We are given the following information:

- **Each ice cube**:
  - **Cools the coffee by 13 degrees**
  - **Makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker**

- Shannon cools her coffee by **65 degrees**.
- She adds **15 milliliters of cream**, which also weakens the coffee.

We are asked: **How many milliliters weaker is Shannon’s iced coffee?**

---

### Step 1: Determine how many ice cubes were used

Each ice cube cools the coffee by **13 degrees**.

So, to cool the coffee by **65 degrees**, she must have used:

$$
\frac{65}{13} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the weakening from the ice cubes

Each ice cube makes the coffee **12 milliliters weaker**.

So, 5 ice cubes make it:

$$
5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ milliliters weaker}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add the weakening from the cream

Shannon also adds **15 milliliters of cream**, which also weakens the coffee.

So, total weakening is:

$$
60 + 15 = 75 \text{ milliliters weaker}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{75} \text{ milliliters weaker}
$$
We are told:

- Ralph's store allows people to **trade 2 old records for 1 new one**.
- **5 people** come in with old records and leave with **7 new records** between them.
- We need to find out **how many old records** the 5 people brought in.

---

### Step 1: Understand the trade rate
The store gives **1 new record for every 2 old records** traded.

So, for every **2 old records**, you get **1 new record**.

This means the **exchange rate** is:
$$
\frac{1 \text{ new}}{2 \text{ old}} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ new per old}
$$

---

### Step 2: Let’s define variables
Let $ x $ be the **total number of old records** brought in by the 5 people.

Then, based on the exchange rate, they would receive:
$$
\frac{x}{2} \text{ new records}
$$

But we are told that they **leave with 7 new records** total. So:
$$
\frac{x}{2} = 7
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $
Multiply both sides by 2:
$$
x = 14
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{14}
$$

So, the 5 people brought in **14 old records**.
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of employees**
The company has **100 employees** in total.

---

### **Step 2: Number of junior programmers**
We are told that the number of **junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees**.

$$
\text{Number of junior programmers} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 20
$$

So, there are **20 junior programmers**.

---

### **Step 3: Number of senior programmers**
Since the total number of employees is 100 and 20 are junior, the remaining must be senior programmers:

$$
\text{Number of senior programmers} = 100 - 20 = 80
$$

So, there are **80 senior programmers**.

---

### **Step 4: Pay for junior programmers**
Each junior programmer is paid **$2000 per month**.

$$
\text{Total pay for junior programmers} = 20 \times 2000 = 40,000
$$

---

### **Step 5: Pay for senior programmers**
Senior programmers are paid **$400 more than junior programmers**.

$$
\text{Pay for one senior programmer} = 2000 + 400 = 2400
$$

$$
\text{Total pay for senior programmers} = 80 \times 2400 = 192,000
$$

---

### **Step 6: Total monthly pay to all programmers**
Now, add the total pay for junior and senior programmers:

$$
\text{Total monthly pay} = 40,000 + 192,000 = \boxed{232,000}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$232,000}
$$

This is the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.
We are given the following information:

- Some people got on the bus **at the terminal** (this is the number we need to find).
- At the **first stop**, **5 more people got in**.
- At the **second stop**, **7 people got off** and **8 more got in**.
- After these stops, there were **20 people heading to the third stop**.

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Let the number of people who got on at the terminal be $ x $.

So initially, the bus has **x people**.

---

### Step 2: First stop

At the first stop, **5 more people get in**.

So now the total number of people is:

$$
x + 5
$$

---

### Step 3: Second stop

At the second stop:
- **7 people get off**, so subtract 7.
- **8 people get in**, so add 8.

So the number of people after the second stop is:

$$
(x + 5) - 7 + 8 = x + 6
$$

---

### Step 4: People heading to the third stop

After the second stop, there are **20 people** heading to the third stop. That means:

$$
x + 6 = 20
$$

---

### Step 5: Solve for $ x $

$$
x + 6 = 20 \\
x = 20 - 6 \\
x = 14
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{14}
$$

So, **14 people got on the bus at the terminal**.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Start with the initial number of lollipops
Oscar starts with **24 lollipops**.

---

### Step 2: He eats 2 on his way to school
$$
24 - 2 = 22 \text{ lollipops left}
$$

---

### Step 3: He passes 14 out to his friends
$$
22 - 14 = 8 \text{ lollipops left}
$$

---

### Step 4: He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends
He gave 14 to his friends, so he buys:
$$
2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ new lollipops}
$$
Now total lollipops:
$$
8 + 28 = 36 \text{ lollipops}
$$

---

### Step 5: He eats 3 more that night
$$
36 - 3 = 33 \text{ lollipops left}
$$

---

### Step 6: He eats 2 more in the morning
$$
33 - 2 = 31 \text{ lollipops left}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{31} \text{ lollipops}
$$
We are told:

- The phone is currently at **60%** charge.
- It recharges at a rate of **1 percentage-point per 3 minutes**.
- We want to know how long it will take to **fully charge**, i.e., reach **100%**.

---

### Step 1: Determine how much more charge is needed

$$
100\% - 60\% = 40\%
$$

So, the phone needs **40 percentage-points** of charge to be fully charged.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the time required

Since the phone charges at **1% every 3 minutes**, then:

$$
\text{Time} = 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Convert minutes to hours

$$
120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{2 \text{ hours}}
$$
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Start with the number of lollipops Erin has:**
   - Erin has **7** lollipops.

2. **Her mother gives her more lollipops:**
   - She gets **10** more.
   - So, total lollipops now = $ 7 + 10 = 17 $.

3. **Erin gives 3 lollipops to Ella:**
   - Subtract 3 from the total.
   - $ 17 - 3 = 14 $.

### ✅ Final Answer: **14 lollipops**.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the reward system

- The customer gets **$1 off their next purchase** for every **$20 they spend**.
- On their **last shopping trip**, they spent **$80**.
  
So, for every $20 spent, they get $1 in rewards.  
$$
\text{Rewards earned} = \frac{80}{20} = 4 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 2: This trip's spending and rewards

This time, the customer spent **$43**.

They **used their rewards** from the last trip (which was **$4**) to reduce the cost.

So, the price before any coupons is:
$$
43 - 4 = 39
$$

---

### Step 3: Apply the coupon

The coupon takes **twice the amount of rewards off the price**.

We already used **$4 in rewards** on this trip. So the coupon takes:
$$
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars off}
$$

Now subtract that from the remaining price after using the rewards:
$$
39 - 8 = 31
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{31}
$$

The customer paid **$31** on this shopping trip.

  $$
  36,000 \times 0.10 = \$3,600
  $$
- **Net income after all taxes:**  
  $$
  36,000 - 3,600 = \$32,400
  $$

---

### **Comparison:**

- **Job A net pay:** \$24,000  
- **Job B net pay:** \$32,400  
- **Difference (Job B - Job A):**  
  $$
  32,400 - 24,000 = \boxed{\$8,400}

$$

---

### **Cozy Homes' Offer:**
- **Advance payment:** $1,100  
- **Monthly installments:** 9 payments of $250 each

**Total cost at Cozy Homes:**

$$
1,100 + (9 \times 250) = 1,100 + 2,250 = \$3,350
$$

---

### **Cost Difference:**

$$
\text{Difference} = 3,450 - 3,350 = \boxed{\$100}

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The cost difference between the two offers is \$100.**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Find the total number of paintball guns
We are told:

- DJ has **8** guns  
- Nick has **10** guns  
- RJ (Richard?) has **1** gun  
- Richard has **5** guns  

So, let’s add them up:

$$
8 + 10 + 1 + 5 = 24 \text{ guns}
$$

### Step 2: Determine how many people there are
There are **4** people: DJ, Nick, RJ, and Richard.

### Step 3: Divide the total number of guns equally among the 4 people
To find how many guns each person would get if they shared them equally:

$$
\frac{24}{4} = 6
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Each person would have **6** paintball guns.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Sugar needed for one batch of suckers**:  
   Mason needs **30 ounces** of sugar for one batch of suckers.

2. **Sugar needed for 8 batches of suckers**:  
   $ 8 \times 30 = 240 $ ounces

3. **Sugar needed for one batch of fudge**:  
   Mason needs **70 ounces** of sugar for one batch of fudge.

4. **Total sugar needed**:  
   Add the sugar for the suckers and the fudge:  
   $ 240 + 70 = 310 $ ounces

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Initial Investment**
Maria buys **8 shares** at **$8 each**.

$$
\text{Total cost} = 8 \times 8 = \$64
$$

---

### **Step 2: First Year – Price Increases by 50%**

The stock price increases by **50%**, so the new price per share is:

$$
\text{New price after increase} = 8 + (0.50 \times 8) = 8 + 4 = \$12
$$

---

### **Step 3: Second Year – Price Decreases by 25%**

Now the stock price decreases by **25%** from the new price of $12.

$$
\text{New price after decrease} = 12 - (0.25 \times 12) = 12 - 3 = \$9
$$

---

### **Step 4: Final Value of All Shares**

Maria still owns **8 shares**, and each is now worth **$9**.

$$
\text{Final value} = 8 \times 9 = \$72
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $\boxed{\$72}$**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Luke ate 2 hot dogs.**

2. **Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke.**  
   So, Thomas ate:  
   $ 3 \times 2 = 6 $ hot dogs.

3. **John ate half the amount Thomas ate.**  
   So, John ate:  
   $ \frac{6}{2} = 3 $ hot dogs.

4. **How many more hot dogs did John eat than Luke?**  
   That means we subtract the number of hot dogs Luke ate from the number John ate:  
   $ 3 - 2 = 1 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **1** hot dog.
We are given:

- A class of **200 students** is split into **3 groups**.
- **Two of the groups are equal in number**.
- The **third group (the smallest)** has **10 fewer students than each of the other two groups**.

Let’s define variables to represent the number of students in each group.

---

### Step 1: Define Variables

Let the number of students in each of the **two equal groups** be $ x $.

Then, the number of students in the **smallest group** is $ x - 10 $.

---

### Step 2: Write the Total Number of Students

The total number of students is:

$$
x + x + (x - 10) = 200
$$

Simplify:

$$
3x - 10 = 200
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

$$
3x = 210 \\
x = 70
$$

---

### Step 4: Find the Smallest Group

Now that we know $ x = 70 $, the smallest group has:

$$
x - 10 = 70 - 10 = 60
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{60}
$$

So, the smallest group has **60 students**.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Define the variables**

Let:
- $ C $ = number of **chickens**
- $ W $ = number of **cows**

We are told:
- Total number of animals = 60  
  So,  
  $$
  C + W = 60
  $$

- There are **twice as many chickens as cows**  
  So,  
  $$
  C = 2W
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Substitute and solve for one variable**

Substitute $ C = 2W $ into the first equation:

$$
2W + W = 60 \\
3W = 60 \\
W = 20
$$

Now substitute back to find $ C $:

$$
C = 2W = 2 \times 20 = 40
$$

So:
- Chickens = 40  
- Cows = 20

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total number of legs**

- Each chicken has **2 legs**, so:
  $$
  40 \text{ chickens} \times 2 = 80 \text{ chicken legs}
  $$

- Each cow has **4 legs**, so:
  $$
  20 \text{ cows} \times 4 = 80 \text{ cow legs}
  $$

- Total legs:
  $$
  80 + 80 = 160
  $$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$

Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: How many balls is Josh juggling at the talent show?**

Josh starts with **3 balls** and adds **1 ball each week**.

- Week 1: 3 balls  
- Week 2: 4 balls  
- Week 3: 5 balls  
- Week 4: 6 balls  

So, by the end of the **fourth week**, Josh is juggling **6 balls**.

---

### **Step 2: What happens when he walks on stage?**

He **slips and drops three of his balls**.

So now, **3 balls are dropped**.

---

### **Step 3: What happens to the dropped balls?**

- **2 balls are caught by people in the crowd.**
- **1 ball gets lost completely** (because it's dark).

So, out of the 3 dropped balls:
- 2 are recovered
- 1 is lost

That means **only 2 balls remain with Josh** after the slip.

---

### **Step 4: How many balls does Josh have left to juggle?**

Originally, he had **6 balls**.

After dropping **3**, he has **3 left**.

Then, **2 are caught**, so only **1 remains** with him.

So, Josh starts juggling with **1 ball**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Josh starts to juggle on stage with 1 ball.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- The **pink frog** weighs **50 pounds**.
- The **pink frog** weighs the same as:
  - A **blue beetle**
  - A **green toad**
- The **pink frog** weighs **10 pounds less than a yellow snake**.
- The **pink frog** weighs **20 pounds more than a red bird**.
- The **container** weighs **20 pounds**.
- We are to find the **total weight of the container plus one of each animal**.

---

### **Step 1: Assign variables**

Let’s assign the following:

- Let $ P = \text{weight of pink frog} = 50 $ pounds
- $ B = \text{weight of blue beetle} $
- $ G = \text{weight of green toad} $
- $ Y = \text{weight of yellow snake} $
- $ R = \text{weight of red bird} $
- $ C = \text{weight of container} = 20 $ pounds

---

### **Step 2: Use the given relationships**

From the problem:

1. $ P = B $ → So, $ B = 50 $
2. $ P = G $ → So, $ G = 50 $
3. $ P = Y - 10 $ → $ 50 = Y - 10 $ → $ Y = 60 $
4. $ P = R + 20 $ → $ 50 = R + 20 $ → $ R = 30 $

So now we know the weights of all animals:

- Pink frog = 50 lbs  
- Blue beetle = 50 lbs  
- Green toad = 50 lbs  
- Yellow snake = 60 lbs  
- Red bird = 30 lbs  
- Container = 20 lbs

---

### **Step 3: Total weight of container and one of each animal**

Add up the weights:

$$
\text{Total weight} = C + P + B + G + Y + R
$$

$$
= 20 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30
$$

$$
= 20 + 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 260 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{260} \text{ pounds}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Outfits from her friend:**  
   Laurel received **24** baby outfits from her friend.

2. **Outfits from the baby shower:**  
   She received **twice** the amount from her friend at the baby shower.  
   So, that's:  
   $ 2 \times 24 = 48 $ outfits.

3. **Outfits from her mom:**  
   Her mom gave her **15** more baby outfits.

---

Now, let's add all the outfits together:

$$
24 + 48 + 15 = 87
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **87 baby outfits**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the original daily distance**
Tyson runs:

$$
5000 \text{ meters per day}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine the increase from the coach's advice**
The coach wants Tyson to run **1/5 times more** than his current daily distance.

So, we calculate **1/5 of 5000 meters**:

$$
\frac{1}{5} \times 5000 = 1000 \text{ meters}
$$

This means the coach wants him to run **1000 meters more** each day.

---

### **Step 3: Find the new daily distance**
Add the extra 1000 meters to the original 5000 meters:

$$
5000 + 1000 = 6000 \text{ meters per day}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the total distance for June**
June has **30 days**.

So, the total distance Tyson ran in June is:

$$
6000 \text{ meters/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 180,000 \text{ meters}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{180,000 \text{ meters}}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Find the price of Juice Box A  
Juice Box A costs **$4**.

---

### Step 2: Find the price of Juice Box B  
Juice Box B is **$5 more than** Juice Box A.  
So:

$$
\text{Price of B} = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the price of Juice Box C  
Juice Box C is **$7 more than** Juice Box A.  
So:

$$
\text{Price of C} = 4 + 7 = 11 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B  
Now subtract the price of B from the price of C:

$$
\text{Difference} = 11 - 9 = 2 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.**

$$
36 \text{ cookies}
$$

---

### Step 2: Cookies given to her son  
She puts **4 cookies** in her son's lunch box **5 days a week**. So:

$$
4 \text{ cookies/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ cookies}
$$

---

### Step 3: Cookies eaten by her husband  
Her husband eats **1 cookie a day for 7 days**:

$$
1 \text{ cookie/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ cookies}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total cookies used by son and husband  
Add the cookies used by both:

$$
20 \text{ (son)} + 7 \text{ (husband)} = 27 \text{ cookies}
$$

---

### Step 5: Cookies left for Jenny  
Subtract the total used from the total in the bag:

$$
36 \text{ (total)} - 27 \text{ (used)} = 9 \text{ cookies}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{9} \text{ cookies}
$$

Jenny eats **9 cookies** per week.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Find the original total cost of the 2 shirts:**
   - Each shirt costs $30.
   - So, for 2 shirts:  
     $$
     2 \times 30 = 60
     $$

2. **Calculate the discount amount (40% off):**
   - 40% of $60 is:  
     $$
     0.40 \times 60 = 24
     $$

3. **Subtract the discount from the original price to find the final amount paid:**

   60 - 24 = 36
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.**
Let's break this down step by step to find the **percentage increase** in daily revenue from making tractors to making silos.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate daily revenue when making tractors**

- They sold **10 tractors per day**
- Each tractor was sold for **$100**

$$
\text{Daily revenue (tractors)} = 10 \times 100 = \$1000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate daily revenue now, making silos**

- They sell **5 silos per day**
- Each silo is sold for **$220**

$$
\text{Daily revenue (silos)} = 5 \times 220 = \$1100
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the difference in revenue**

$$
\text{Increase in revenue} = 1100 - 1000 = \$100
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase**

$$
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Original amount}} \right) \times 100
= \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**They are making 10% more per day now.**

### Step 1: Height of the shortest tree  
We are told:
- The **shortest tree** is **6 feet** tall.

---

### Step 2: Height of the second tree  
The second tree is **5 feet more** than the shortest tree.

So:
$$
\text{Height of second tree} = 6 + 5 = 11 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total height of the first two trees  
Now, add the heights of the first and second trees:
$$
6 + 11 = 17 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### Step 4: Height of the tallest tree  
We are told that the **tallest tree is twice the combined height** of the other two trees.

So:
$$
\text{Height of tallest tree} = 2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{34} \text{ feet}

Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Initial amount Dean has
Dean starts with:
$$
\$28
$$

### Step 2: Cost of the toys
- He buys **6 toy cars**, each costing **\$2**:
  $$
  6 \times 2 = \$12
  $$
- He buys **5 teddy bears**, each costing **\$1**:
  $$
  5 \times 1 = \$5
  $$

Total cost of the toys:
$$
\$12 + \$5 = \$17
$$

### Step 3: Subtract the cost from initial amount
$$
\$28 - \$17 = \$11
$$

So, after buying the toys, Dean has **\$11** left.

### Step 4: His mother gives him extra money
His mother gives him an additional:
$$
\$10
$$

### Step 5: Total money Dean has now
$$
\$11 + \$10 = \$21

\boxed{\$21}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step to figure out **how many friends Morgan can invite** to her birthday party, given the budget of $90.

---

### 1. **What is the total cost for Morgan and her friends?**

We need to consider:

- **Mini-golf**: Each round costs **$5**
- **Arcade tokens**: She wants **$5** in tokens
- **Go-karts**: Each ride costs **$10**, and she wants to ride them **twice**

So let’s calculate the **fixed costs** (costs that don’t depend on the number of friends):

- Mini-golf: $5  
- Arcade tokens: $5  
- Go-karts: $10 × 2 = $20  

**Total fixed cost = $5 + $5 + $20 = $30**

---

### 2. **What about the cost per person?**

Morgan is also going to the party, so we need to include **her own cost** as well.

Each person (including Morgan) will have to pay for:

- **One round of mini-golf**: $5  
- **Ride the go-karts twice**: $10 × 2 = $20  

So **per person cost = $5 + $20 = $25**

---

### 3. **Set up the equation**

Let’s let **x** be the number of **friends** Morgan invites. Then the total number of people at the party is **x + 1** (including Morgan).

Total cost = (Number of people) × (Cost per person) + Fixed costs

$$
\text{Total cost} = (x + 1) \times 25 + 30
$$

She has a **budget of $90**, so:

$$
(x + 1) \times 25 + 30 \leq 90
$$

---

### 4. **Solve the inequality**

$$
(x + 1) \times 25 + 30 \leq 90
$$

Subtract 30 from both sides:

$$
(x + 1) \times 25 \leq 60
$$

Divide both sides by 25:

$$
x + 1 \leq \frac{60}{25} = 2.4
$$

Now subtract 1 from both sides:

$$
x \leq 1.4
$$

Since you can't invite a fraction of a friend, the **maximum number of friends** she can invite is:

$$
\boxed{1}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Morgan can invite 1 friend.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Daily Pocket Money:**
Marisa gets **$5** every day.

### 2. **Cost of Lollipops:**
She buys **4 lollipops** each day, and each lollipop costs **25 cents**, which is **$0.25**.

So, the cost of 4 lollipops per day is:
$$
4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \text{ dollar}
$$

### 3. **Daily Savings:**
She saves the **change** from her $5 pocket money after buying the lollipops:
$$
5.00 - 1.00 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

### 4. **Total Savings Over 5 Days:**
She saves **$4** each day, so over **5 days**, she saves:
$$
4.00 \times 5 = 20.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Marisa puts $20 in her piggy bank after 5 days.**
We are given the following information:

- Billy has **$10**.
- Candy costs **$1.50 per pound**.
- He spends **half his change** on **gumballs**, which cost **$0.05 each**.
- He buys **40 gumballs**.

We are asked to find: **How many pounds of candy did he buy?**

---

### Step 1: Find the total cost of the gumballs

Each gumball costs **$0.05**, and he bought **40 gumballs**:

$$
\text{Cost of gumballs} = 40 \times 0.05 = 2.00
$$

So, he spent **$2.00** on gumballs.

---

### Step 2: Determine how much money Billy had left after buying the gumballs

He spent half of his **change** on gumballs, so:

$$
\text{Half his change} = \$2.00
$$
$$
\text{Total change} = 2 \times 2.00 = \$4.00
$$

So, Billy had **$4.00 in change** after buying the candy.

---

### Step 3: Find out how much he spent on candy

Billy started with **$10**, and had **$4.00 in change**, so:

$$
\text{Amount spent on candy} = 10 - 4 = 6.00
$$

---

### Step 4: Find how many pounds of candy he bought

Candy costs **$1.50 per pound**, so:

$$
\text{Pounds of candy} = \frac{6.00}{1.50} = 4
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{4}
$$

Billy bought **4 pounds** of candy.
We are told:

- Carver just turned **45 years old**.
- His age is **5 years less than twice the age of his son**.

Let’s define the son's age as $ x $.

### Step 1: Write an equation
Carver's age = 5 years less than twice his son's age  
So:

$$
45 = 2x - 5
$$

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

Add 5 to both sides:

$$
45 + 5 = 2x \\
50 = 2x
$$

Divide both sides by 2:

$$
x = \frac{50}{2} = 25
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The son is 25 years old.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the distances between the cities**

- From **City A to City B**: 75 miles  
- From **City B to City C**: 100 miles  
- From **City C back to City A**:  
  - This is **50 miles less than the combined distance** of the first two legs.  
  - Combined distance of A→B and B→C = 75 + 100 = **175 miles**  
  - So, from C to A = 175 - 50 = **125 miles**

---

### **Step 2: Total one-way trip distance**

Now, add up all three legs of the trip:

$$
\text{Total one-way trip} = 75 + 100 + 125 = \boxed{300} \text{ miles}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total daily distance**

The train does this trip **3 times a day**, so:

$$
\text{Daily distance} = 3 \times 300 = \boxed{900} \text{ miles per day}
$$

---

### **Step 4: How many days until service is needed?**

The train needs service every **18,000 miles**. So, divide total miles by daily distance:

$$
\text{Days between services} = \frac{18,000}{900} = \boxed{20}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{20} \text{ days}
$$

The train goes **20 days** between services.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the stuffing amounts

- **Rottweiler bed** = 8 pounds of stuffing  
- **Chihuahua bed** = 2 pounds of stuffing  
- **Collie bed** = average of Rottweiler and Chihuahua beds

So, to find the amount of stuffing for a **collie bed**, we calculate the **average** of the Rottweiler and Chihuahua:

$$
\text{Collie bed} = \frac{8 + 2}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate total stuffing needed

We need to make:
- 4 chihuahua beds  
- 3 collie beds  

So,

- Chihuahua beds: $ 4 \times 2 = 8 $ pounds  
- Collie beds: $ 3 \times 5 = 15 $ pounds  

---

### Step 3: Add them together

$$
\text{Total stuffing} = 8 + 15 = \boxed{23} \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**23 pounds of stuffing** are needed.
Let's break the trip into parts and calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey.

---

### **Part 1: Driving to his friend's house**

- **Distance:**  
  The original distance was 200 miles, but he took a detour that added **10 miles**.  
  So total distance = $ 200 + 10 = 210 $ miles

- **Speed:**  
  He drove at **70 mph**

- **Time taken:**  
  $$
  \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{210}{70} = 3 \text{ hours}
  $$

---

### **Part 2: Driving back home**

- **Distance:**  
  The return trip is **240 miles**

- **Speed:**  
  He drove at **80 mph**

- **Time taken:**  
  $$
  \text{Time} = \frac{240}{80} = 3 \text{ hours}
  $$

---

### **Total Trip Time**

$$
\text{Total time} = 3 \text{ hours (to)} + 3 \text{ hours (back)} = \boxed{6 \text{ hours}}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The entire trip took 6 hours.**
We are given the following information:

- Total number of **fourth-graders** at Small Tree School: **96**

### Step 1: Find the number of boys

Total students = 96  
Number of girls = 43  
So, number of boys =  
$$
96 - 43 = 53
$$

There are **53 boys** in total.

---

### Step 2: Subtract the number of absent boys

On Friday, **4 boys** were absent.  
So, the number of boys **present** on Friday is:  
$$
53 - 4 = 49
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{49}
$$

**49 fourth-grade boys were at Small Tree School on Friday.**
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Number of girls**:  
   There are **6 girls** in the park.

2. **Number of boys**:  
   The problem says there are **twice the number of boys** as girls.  
   So, the number of boys = 2 × number of girls  
   = 2 × 6 = **12 boys**

3. **Total number of kids**:  
   Total = Number of girls + Number of boys  
   = 6 + 12 = **18 kids**

### ✅ Final Answer: **18 kids** are in the park.
We are told that Jane needs a **total of at least 42 points** across **3 tests** to be promoted. She has already taken **two tests**, scoring:

- First test: **15 points**
- Second test: **18 points**

### Step 1: Add the points from the first two tests
$$
15 + 18 = 33 \text{ points}
$$

### Step 2: Determine how many more points she needs
She needs at least **42 points total**, so:
$$
42 - 33 = 9 \text{ points}
$$

### Step 3: Find the minimum score needed on the third test
Jane must score **at least 9 points** on the third test to meet the requirement.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{9}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:

- $ x $ = number of people kicked out for **refusing to wear masks**

We are told:
- **3 customers** were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.  
  So, $ x = 3 $

---

### Step 2: Number of people kicked out for shoplifting

The problem says:

> "A number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting."

This means:

$$
\text{Shoplifters} = 4x - 5
$$

Substitute $ x = 3 $:

$$
\text{Shoplifters} = 4(3) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7
$$

So, **7 people** were kicked out for shoplifting.

---

### Step 3: Number of people kicked out for physical violence

> "Three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale."

$$
\text{Physical violence} = 3 \times \text{Shoplifters} = 3 \times 7 = 21
$$

So, **21 people** were kicked out for physical violence.

---

### Step 4: Total number of people kicked out

We are told the **total** number of people kicked out is **50**.

Now add up all the known groups:

- Refusing masks: 3  
- Shoplifting: 7  
- Physical violence: 21  
- **Other reasons**: ?

$$
\text{Total} = 3 + 7 + 21 + \text{Other reasons} = 50
$$

$$
\text{Other reasons} = 50 - (3 + 7 + 21) = 50 - 31 = 19
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{19}
$$

**19 people were kicked out for other reasons.**
We are given the following information:

- Erin **now** has **three times more points than Sara**.
- Sara scored **8 points**.
- Erin **scored 14 points** (this is the additional score that brings her total to three times Sara's score).

We are asked: **How many points did Erin have before scoring those 14 points?**

---

### Step 1: Find Erin's current total points

We know:
- Sara has **8 points**
- Erin now has **three times more** than Sara

So, Erin’s **current total** = 3 × Sara’s points  
= 3 × 8 = **24 points**

---

### Step 2: Find how many points Erin had before scoring 14 points

Erin scored **14 points** to reach a total of **24 points**.

So, Erin had:

$$
24 - 14 = 10 \text{ points before}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**10 points**

- **Total cost for frames:**  
  $$
  44 \times 20 = 880
  $$

---

### **2. Etching Cost (20% extra per frame)**
- **Etching cost per frame:** 20% of $20 = $4  
- **Total etching cost:**  
  $$
  44 \times 4 = 176
  $$

---

### **3. Pins**
- **Number of seniors receiving pins:** 2  
- **Cost per pin:** $5  
- **Total cost for pins:**  
  $$
  2 \times 5 = 10
  $$

---

### **4. Cords for Officers**

- **Cost per cord:** $12  
- **Total cost for cords:**  
  $$
  11 \times 12 = 132
  $$

---

### **Total Cost**
Now, add up all the costs:

$$
\text{Total cost} = 880 + 176 + 10 + 132 = 1198
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $1,198**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Market price of the wallpaper:**  
   $400

2. **DIY saves 20% of the market price:**  
   So, Ethan saves:  
   $$
   20\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.20 \times 400 = 80
   $$

3. **Total cost for Ethan (DIY):**  
   Subtract the savings from the original price:  
   $$
   400 - 80 = 320
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$320**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Friday**
- The store sold **14 pairs** of tennis shoes.

---

### **Step 2: Saturday**
- They sold **double** the number from Friday.
- So, on Saturday:  
  $$
  14 \times 2 = 28 \text{ pairs}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Sunday (last day of the sale)**
- On Sunday, they sold **half** the amount from Saturday.
- So, on Sunday before returns:  
  $$
  28 \div 2 = 14 \text{ pairs}
  $$

- However, **6 people returned** their shoes because they didn't fit.
- That means **6 pairs were returned**, so the **net number of pairs sold on Sunday** is:
  $$
  14 - 6 = 8 \text{ pairs}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Total number of pairs sold during the sale**
Add up all the pairs sold over the three days:

$$
14 \text{ (Friday)} + 28 \text{ (Saturday)} + 8 \text{ (Sunday)} = 50 \text{ pairs}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{50} \text{ pairs of tennis shoes}

Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Tuesday practice**
- Hallie has **1 hour** of dance practice on **Tuesdays**.

---

### **Step 2: Thursday practice**
- She has **2 hours** of dance practice on **Thursdays**.

---

### **Step 3: Saturday practice**
- On **Saturdays**, her practice lasts **twice as long as Tuesday's night class**.
- Since Tuesday's class is **1 hour**, Saturday's class is:
  $$
  2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ hours}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Total weekly practice time**
Now, add up all the practice times:

- Tuesday: 1 hour  
- Thursday: 2 hours  
- Saturday: 2 hours  

$$
\text{Total} = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Hallie had 5 hours of dance practice per week.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Total value of equipment purchased
The company bought **$400,000** worth of equipment.

### Step 2: Percentage of faulty equipment
**40%** of the total equipment was faulty.

So, the value of the faulty equipment is:
$$
40\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.40 \times 400,000 = \$160,000
$$

### Step 3: Value of functioning equipment
The remaining equipment is functioning. Since 40% was faulty, the rest (60%) is functioning.

So, the value of the functioning equipment is:
$$
60\% \text{ of } \$400,000 = 0.60 \times 400,000 = \$240,000
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$240,000}
$$

This is the total amount of money spent on **functioning pieces of equipment**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total number of sheep:** 30

2. **She divides them into two halves:**
   - Half of the sheep = $ \frac{30}{2} = 15 $ sheep
   - So, 15 sheep give **1 kg of milk** each per day.
   - The other 15 sheep give **2 kg of milk** each per day.

3. **Calculate total milk from each group:**
   - From the first group (15 sheep):  
     $ 15 \times 1 = 15 $ kg
   - From the second group (15 sheep):  
     $ 15 \times 2 = 30 $ kg

4. **Add both amounts together:**
   $ 15 + 30 = 45 $ kg

### ✅ Final Answer: **45 kg of milk per day**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Mrs. Sherman made a dozen bread rolls**  
   A dozen means 12 rolls.

2. **She fed her 6 children, one roll each**  
   So she used up 6 rolls for the children.

3. **That leaves the remaining rolls**  
   $ 12 - 6 = 6 $ rolls left.

4. **She broke each of the remaining rolls into 8 pieces**  
   So each of the 6 rolls is broken into 8 pieces:  
   $ 6 \text{ rolls} \times 8 \text{ pieces per roll} = 48 \text{ pieces} $

5. **She fed those pieces to the chickens**  
   So the number of pieces fed to the chickens is **48**.

### ✅ Final Answer: **48 pieces**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of pupils
There are **40 pupils** in the class.

---

### Step 2: Number of pupils who like blue
Half of the class likes blue:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ pupils}
$$

So, **20 pupils** like blue.

---

### Step 3: Remaining pupils after those who like blue
$$
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ pupils remaining}
$$

---

### Step 4: Number of pupils who like green
One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pupils}
$$

So, **5 pupils** like green.

---

### Step 5: Remaining pupils who like yellow
Now subtract those who like blue and green from the total to find how many like yellow:

$$
40 - 20 - 5 = 15 \text{ pupils}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{15} \text{ pupils like yellow.}
$$
We are given:

- Lucy sells apples at **$4 per apple**.
- On **Monday**, she sold all the apples picked and earned **$56**.
- On **Tuesday**, she picked **12 apples**.
- On **Wednesday**, she picked **double the number of apples** she did on Tuesday.

We are asked to find the total number of apples she picked over the three days.

---

### Step 1: Find how many apples Lucy picked on Monday

She sold all the apples she picked on Monday and got $56.  
Since each apple is sold for **$4**, we can calculate the number of apples sold (and picked) on Monday:

$$
\text{Number of apples on Monday} = \frac{\text{Total money earned}}{\text{Price per apple}} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
$$

So, Lucy picked **14 apples on Monday**.

---

### Step 2: Find how many apples Lucy picked on Tuesday

We are told that she picked **12 apples on Tuesday**.

---

### Step 3: Find how many apples Lucy picked on Wednesday

On Wednesday, she picked **double** the number of apples she picked on Tuesday:

$$
\text{Apples on Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24
$$

---

### Step 4: Add up the apples from all three days

$$
\text{Total apples} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} = 14 + 12 + 24 = 50
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{50}
$$

Lucy picked **50 apples over the three days**.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the total number of socks
Lindsay has **50 socks** that need washing.

---

### Step 2: Understand what she washed

She washed:
- **10 pairs of socks**
- **15 loose socks**

#### A. How many socks are in 10 pairs?
Each pair = 2 socks  
So, 10 pairs = $ 10 \times 2 = 20 $ socks

#### B. Add the loose socks:
She also washed **15 loose socks**

So, total socks washed = $ 20 + 15 = 35 $ socks

---

### Step 3: Find out how many socks she missed

Total socks = 50  
Socks washed = 35  
So, socks missed = $ 50 - 35 = 15 $

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Lindsay missed 15 socks.**
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Rachel bought 23 cookies.**  
   So, she starts with **23 cookies**.

2. **Janet gave her 42 cookies.**  
   Now, Rachel has:  
   $ 23 + 42 = 65 $ cookies.

3. **Her brother ate 44 of those cookies.**  
   So, we subtract 44 from the total:  
   $ 65 - 44 = 21 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **21 cookies are left for Rachel.**
We are given:

- **Principal (P)** = $3,650  
- **Time (T)** = 5 months  
- **Annual interest rate (R)** = 10%  
- **Payment method**: Equal monthly payments

### Step 1: Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate
Since the interest is compounded monthly (or assumed simple interest), we convert the annual rate to a monthly rate:

$$
\text{Monthly interest rate} = \frac{10\%}{12} = \frac{0.10}{12} \approx 0.008333
$$

### Step 2: Use the formula for equal monthly payments (amortization)

When making equal monthly payments to repay a loan, we use the **amortization formula**:

$$
P = \frac{r \cdot PV}{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}
$$

Where:
- $ P $ = monthly payment  
- $ r $ = monthly interest rate  
- $ PV $ = present value (loan amount)  
- $ n $ = number of payments

We want to solve for $ P $:

$$
P = \frac{r \cdot PV}{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}
$$

Plug in the values:

- $ r = 0.008333 $
- $ PV = 3650 $
- $ n = 5 $

$$
P = \frac{0.008333 \cdot 3650}{1 - (1 + 0.008333)^{-5}}
$$

### Step 3: Calculate numerator and denominator

**Numerator:**

$$
0.008333 \times 3650 \approx 30.4167
$$

**Denominator:**

$$
(1 + 0.008333)^{-5} = (1.008333)^{-5}
$$

Using a calculator:

$$
(1.008333)^{-5} \approx 0.9615
$$

So,

$$
1 - 0.9615 = 0.0385
$$

### Step 4: Final calculation

$$
P = \frac{30.4167}{0.0385} \approx 789.91
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Karan has to pay approximately $789.91 per month.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate how far **Cho** hiked

- **Speed:** 14 kilometers per hour

$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate how far **Chloe** hiked

- **Speed:** 9 kilometers per hour  
- **Time:** 5 hours  

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 9 \times 5 = 45 \text{ kilometers}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the difference in distance

$$
\text{Difference} = 112 - 45 = 67 \text{ kilometers}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.**

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many silver and gold pesos Axel has.**

- **Silver pesos:**  
  Axel has **50 silver pesos**.

- **Gold pesos:**  
  Axel has **80 gold pesos**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many silver and gold pesos Anna has.**

- **Anna's silver pesos:**  
  Anna has **twice as many silver pesos as Axel**.  
  So,  
  $$
  2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ silver pesos}
  $$

- **Anna's gold pesos:**  
  Anna has **40 more gold pesos than Axel**.  
  So,  
  $$
  80 + 40 = 120 \text{ gold pesos}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Add up all the pesos they have together.**

- **Total silver pesos:**  
  Axel: 50  
  Anna: 100  
  Total: $ 50 + 100 = 150 $

- **Total gold pesos:**  
  Axel: 80  
  Anna: 120  
  Total: $ 80 + 120 = 200 $

- **Total pesos altogether:**  
  $$
  150 + 200 = \boxed{350}
  $$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{350}

Let's break this down step by step to find out how much **profit** Millie makes **per hour** she runs her lemonade stand.

---

### 1. **Total Cost of Supplies**
Millie spends **$18** to buy supplies for **3 pitchers** of lemonade.

---

### 2. **Total Amount of Lemonade**
Each pitcher holds **12 cups**, so:

$$
3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups}
$$

So, Millie has **36 cups** of lemonade in total.

---

### 3. **Revenue from Selling All Lemonade**
She sells each cup for **$1**, so:

$$
36 \text{ cups} \times \$1/\text{cup} = \$36
$$

So, if she sells all the lemonade, she gets **$36** in revenue.

---

### 4. **Total Profit**
Profit is **revenue minus cost**:

$$
\$36 - \$18 = \$18 \text{ profit}
$$

So, Millie makes a **$18 profit** if she sells all the lemonade.

---

### 5. **Time to Sell All Lemonade**
She sells an average of **4 cups per hour**.

$$
\frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/hour}} = 9 \text{ hours}
$$

So, it takes her **9 hours** to sell all the lemonade.

---

### 6. **Profit Per Hour**
To find the **profit per hour**, divide the total profit by the number of hours:

$$
\frac{\$18}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Millie makes a profit of $2 per hour** that she spends running her lemonade stand.
We are told that Mr. Ruther sold **3/5** of his land and had **12.8 hectares left**. We need to find out how much land he had **at first**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the fraction remaining

If he sold **3/5** of his land, then the part **not sold** is:

$$
1 - \frac{3}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
$$

So, **2/5** of his land is equal to **12.8 hectares**.

---

### Step 2: Let the total land be $ x $

We can write the equation:

$$
\frac{2}{5}x = 12.8
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

Multiply both sides by 5:

$$
2x = 12.8 \times 5 = 64
$$

Now divide both sides by 2:

$$
x = \frac{64}{2} = 32
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Mr. Ruther originally had **32 hectares** of land.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of choir members**
The choir has **52 members**.

---

### **Step 2: Number of boys and girls**
- 50% are boys → $ 0.5 \times 52 = 26 $ boys  
- 50% are girls → $ 0.5 \times 52 = 26 $ girls

So, there are **26 girls** in the choir.

---

### **Step 3: Choir performs with just female members**
They plan to perform with **only the girls**, so that means **26 people** were supposed to perform.

---

### **Step 4: Half the performers can't make it**
On the day of the performance, **half the people performing can't make it**.

- Half of 26 is $ \frac{26}{2} = 13 $
- So, **13 girls** couldn't make it

That means only **13 girls** showed up to perform.

---

### **Step 5: Teachers join the performance**
The **3 teachers** decide to sing with them.

So, we add those 3 teachers to the 13 girls who made it:

$$
13 + 3 = 16
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{16}
$$

**16 people sang in the performance.**
To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the **average** of his 5 test scores.

### Step 1: List the test scores
Wilson's test scores are:  
65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

### Step 2: Add the scores together

$$
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = ?
$$

Let’s add them step by step:

- 65 + 94 = 159  
- 159 + 81 = 240  
- 240 + 86 = 326  
- 326 + 74 = **399**

### Step 3: Divide by the number of tests (5)

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{399}{5} = 79.8
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Wilson's current math grade is **79.8**.

Since grades are often rounded to one decimal place or as a whole number, depending on the school policy, this would typically be written as **79.8** or **80** if rounded up.

So, **Wilson's current math grade is 79.8**, which is **less than 80**, so he doesn’t meet the requirement for the car.

4. **Number of pencils** = 8  

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the erasers  
$$
6 \text{ erasers} \times \$2 = \$12
$$

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the pencils  
$$
8 \text{ pencils} \times \$3 = \$24
$$

### Step 3: Add the two amounts together  
$$
\$12 + \$24 = \$36
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
$$
\boxed{\$36}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Messages to Ms. Thompson:**  
   James delivers **66 messages** to Ms. Thompson.

2. **Messages to Mr. Yu:**  
   He delivers **1/3 as many messages** to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson.  
   So, we calculate:  
   $$
   \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
   $$  
   Therefore, James delivers **22 messages** to Mr. Yu.

3. **Total messages delivered:**  
   Add the messages to both teachers:  
   $$
   66 + 22 = 88
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **88 messages** in total.

---

### 🎢 **Carnival Details:**

- **Number of rides:** 9  
- **Cost per ride ticket:** $2 per ticket  
- **Each ride costs:** 2 tickets → $2 × 2 = **$4 per ride**  
- **Total cost for all 9 rides using tickets:**  
  $$
  9 \text{ rides} × \$4/\text{ride} = \$36
  $$

---

### 💰 **Option 1: Dasha buys tickets (for both of them)**

Dasha buys tickets for **all 9 rides**, so she spends:

$$
\$36
$$

---

### 💰 **Option 2: David buys a ride bracelet**

David buys a **ride bracelet** for **$30**, which gives him access to **all 9 rides**.

So, David spends:

$$
\$30
$$

---

### ✅ **How much does David save?**

Compare the two options:

- Dasha spends: **$36**
- David spends: **$30**

$$
\text{Savings} = \$36 - \$30 = \boxed{\$6}
$$

---

### ✅ **Answer: David saves $6.**

### Step 1: Understand the ratio

The ratio of Betty's popsicles to Sam's is **5:6**, which means:

- For every **5** popsicles Betty has, Sam has **6**.

So we can think of their popsicles as being in parts:
- Betty = 5 parts
- Sam = 6 parts
- Total parts = 5 + 6 = **11 parts**

---

### Step 2: Find the value of one part

Total number of popsicles = 165  
Total parts = 11

So, each part is:

$$
\frac{165}{11} = 15
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate how many popsicles each has

- Betty has: $ 5 \times 15 = 75 $
- Sam has: $ 6 \times 15 = 90 $

---

### Step 4: Find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty

$$
90 - 75 = 15
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{15}
$$

Sam has **15 more popsicles** than Betty.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much Tim saves by switching from his cable subscription to streaming services.

---

### **Step 1: Cost of Cable Subscription**
Tim was paying **$60 per month** for his cable package.

---

### **Step 2: Cost of Streaming Services**

He now gets:
- **Netflix**: $10/month
- **Hulu**: $10/month
- **Disney+**: $10/month

But he **saves 20%** when he bundles these three services together.

#### **First, calculate the total cost without bundling:**
$$
\$10 + \$10 + \$10 = \$30 \text{ per month}
$$

#### **Now apply the 20% discount:**
$$
\text{Discount} = 20\% \times \$30 = 0.20 \times 30 = \$6
$$

$$
\text{Total cost with bundling} = \$30 - \$6 = \$24 \text{ per month}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate Monthly Savings**

$$
\text{Savings} = \text{Cable cost} - \text{Streaming cost} = \$60 - \$24 = \$36
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**Tim saves $36 per month** by cancelling his cable subscription and switching to streaming services.
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Time spent writing the song**
Carol spends **4 hours** writing the song.

---

### **Step 2: Time spent recording the song**
She spends **half that much time** recording it.

$$
\text{Recording time} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Time spent editing the song**
She spends **90 minutes** editing.  
We need to convert this to **hours** for consistency:

$$
90 \text{ minutes} = \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total work time**
Add up all the times:

$$
\text{Total time} = 4 + 2 + 1.5 = 7.5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Percentage of time spent editing**
Now, find what percentage of the total time was spent editing:

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Editing time}}{\text{Total time}} \right) \times 100
= \left( \frac{1.5}{7.5} \right) \times 100
= 0.2 \times 100
= 20\%
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**20%** of Carol's total work time was spent editing.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand what Wendy wants to do
She wants to **place 20 more than double** the number of books in a shelving system that has:

- **6 rows**
- **6 columns**

So, first, we need to figure out how many **slots** there are in the shelving system. That will tell us how many books she can place.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of slots
Each row has 6 columns, and there are 6 rows:

$$
\text{Total slots} = 6 \text{ rows} \times 6 \text{ columns} = 36 \text{ slots}
$$

So, Wendy wants to place **20 more than double** the number of books in these 36 slots.

---

### Step 3: Set up the expression
Let’s define:
- $ x $ = number of books Wendy wants to place

She wants to place **20 more than double** the number of books in the shelves.

So:

$$
x = 2 \times 36 + 20
$$

$$
x = 72 + 20 = 92
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Wendy will need to carry **92 books** to complete her task.
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Start with the cards Erica made**
Erica made **20** Valentine's cards.

---

### **Step 2: Add the cards from her dad**
Her dad brought her **2 boxes**, each with **15** cards:

$$
2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ cards}
$$

So now she has:
$$
20 + 30 = 50 \text{ cards}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Subtract the cards she passed out**
She gave away:
- **24** to her classmates
- **5** to her family

Total given away:
$$
24 + 5 = 29 \text{ cards}
$$

Now she has:
$$
50 - 29 = 21 \text{ cards}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add the cards she received**
She received **17** more cards from family and friends.

Now she has:
$$
21 + 17 = 38 \text{ cards}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{38}
$$

Erica now has **38** Valentine's Day cards.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of slices
Jenny has **12 slices** of pizza.

---

### Step 2: Slices given to Bill
Bill gets **1/3** of the pizza:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### Step 3: Slices given to Mark
Mark gets **1/4** of the pizza:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total slices given away
Add the slices given to Bill and Mark:

$$
4 + 3 = 7 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### Step 5: Slices Jenny eats
Jenny eats **2 slices**.

---

### Step 6: Total slices eaten or given away
$$
7 \text{ (given away)} + 2 \text{ (eaten by Jenny)} = 9 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### Step 7: Slices left
Subtract from the total:

$$
12 - 9 = 3 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**3 slices are left.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand what Mark has and needs
- **Current amount in the bank:** $50  
- **Earnings per day:** $10  
- **Cost of the bike:** $300  

### Step 2: Determine how much more money Mark needs
He already has $50, so he needs:
$$
300 - 50 = 250 \text{ dollars}
$$

### Step 3: Calculate how many days it will take to save $250
Since he earns $10 per day, we divide the amount he needs by his daily earnings:
$$
\frac{250}{10} = 25 \text{ days}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Mark needs to work for 25 days to save enough money to buy the bike.**
Let's break the problem down step by step.

### Step 1: Number of spiders
Nancy saw **90 spiders**.

---

### Step 2: Number of millipedes
She saw **1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders**.

$$
\text{Millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
$$

---

### Step 3: Number of stink bugs
The number of stink bugs is **twice the number of millipedes minus 12**.

$$
\text{Stink bugs} = 2 \times 30 - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48
$$

---

### Step 4: Total number of bugs
Now, add up all the bugs:

$$
\text{Total bugs} = \text{Spiders} + \text{Millipedes} + \text{Stink bugs}
$$
$$
= 90 + 30 + 48 = 168
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{168}
$$

   So, total calories = 16 ounces × 3 calories/ounce = **48 calories**.

### ✅ Final Answer: **48 calories**
Let's break this down step by step to calculate how much the builder earns in a year.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many days the builder works each month**

- The builder works **4 weeks every month**.
- He works **6 days every week**.

So, per month:

$$
4 \text{ weeks/month} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 24 \text{ days/month}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how many days he works in a year**

There are **12 months** in a year.

$$
24 \text{ days/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 288 \text{ days/year}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate his yearly earnings**

He is paid **$50 per day**.

$$
288 \text{ days/year} \times 50 \text{ dollars/day} = 14,400 \text{ dollars/year}

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$14,400}
$$

The builder earns **\$14,400** in a year.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the amount of ingredients needed for a **quadruple batch**

- The **normal recipe** calls for:
  - **3 cups of flour**
  - **1 cup of milk**

Since Mark is making a **quadruple batch**, we multiply these amounts by 4:

- **Flour needed:**  
  $ 3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups} $

- **Milk needed:**  
  $ 1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups} $

---

### Step 2: Determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are needed

- **Flour is sold in 2-cup bags.**  
  So, to get 12 cups of flour, we divide:  
  $ \frac{12}{2} = 6 $ bags of flour

- **Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.**  
  To get 4 cups of milk, we divide:  
  $ \frac{4}{2} = 2 $ bottles of milk

---

### Step 3: Find how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy

$$
6 \text{ (bags of flour)} - 2 \text{ (bottles of milk)} = 4
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the energy usage per hour**
Mel uses a **900-watt** air conditioner.

So, **each hour**, the air conditioner uses:

$$
900 \text{ watts} = 0.9 \text{ kilowatts (kW)}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Original daily usage**
He uses the AC for **8 hours a day**.

So, his **daily energy consumption** is:

$$
0.9 \text{ kW/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 7.2 \text{ kWh/day}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Reduced daily usage**
He reduces the time by **5 hours**, so now he uses it for:

$$
8 - 5 = 3 \text{ hours/day}
$$

His **new daily energy consumption** is:

$$
0.9 \text{ kW/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 2.7 \text{ kWh/day}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Energy saved per day**
The **energy saved per day** is:

$$
7.2 \text{ kWh/day} - 2.7 \text{ kWh/day} = 4.5 \text{ kWh/day}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Total energy saved in 30 days**
Now, multiply the daily savings by 30 days:

$$
4.5 \text{ kWh/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 135 \text{ kWh}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{135 \text{ kWh}}
$$

Mel will save **135 kilowatt-hours (kWh)** of electric energy in 30 days.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Count the number of zebras and their stripe counts
- **Two zebras** with **17 stripes each**:  
  So that’s $2 \times 17 = 34$ stripes.

- **One zebra** with **36 stripes**:  
  That’s $36$ stripes.

- **Another zebra** with **half that many stripes** (i.e., half of 36):  
  That’s $36 \div 2 = 18$ stripes.

---

### Step 2: Add up all the stripes
$$
34 + 36 + 18 = 88 \text{ stripes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Count the total number of zebras
- 2 zebras with 17 stripes each  
- 1 zebra with 36 stripes  
- 1 zebra with 18 stripes  

So, total number of zebras = $2 + 1 + 1 = 4$

---

### Step 4: Calculate the average number of stripes per zebra
$$
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total stripes}}{\text{Number of zebras}} = \frac{88}{4} = 22
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**22 stripes on average**.
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Determine how many sandwiches are needed**
Each sandwich serves **4 people**, and there are **20 people** total.

$$
\text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
$$

---

### 2. **Calculate the amount of meat and cheese needed**
Each sandwich requires **1 pound of meat** and **1 pound of cheese**.

So for **5 sandwiches**:
- Meat needed = $ 5 \times 1 = 5 $ pounds
- Cheese needed = $ 5 \times 1 = 5 $ pounds

---

### 3. **Calculate the cost of the meat and cheese**
- Meat costs **$7.00 per pound**:  
  $$
  \text{Cost of meat} = 5 \times 7 = 35 \text{ dollars}
  $$

- Cheese costs **$3.00 per pound**:  
  $$
  \text{Cost of cheese} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### 4. **Total cost**
$$
\text{Total cost} = 35 + 15 = 50 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Tyson would spend $50 on meat and cheese.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial quantities**

We are told:

- There is **twice as much corn as cannolis** at Allan's house.
- He has a total of **40 cannolis** in his house.

So, initially:

- Number of **cannolis** = 40  
- Number of **corns** = 2 × number of cannolis = 2 × 40 = **80**

---

### **Step 2: Changes in quantities**

Allan buys more:

- He buys **60 more cannolis**, so new number of cannolis = 40 + 60 = **100**
- He buys **40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis** after the purchase.

So, number of corns bought = 100 - 40 = **60**

Now add this to the original number of corns (which was 80):

- New total number of **corns** = 80 + 60 = **140**

---

### **Step 3: Find the combined total**

Now we add the final number of **cannolis** and **corns**:

- Cannolis = 100  
- Corns = 140

**Combined total** = 100 + 140 = **240**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**240**
Let's break the problem down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Total steps Elliott wants to take**
Elliott aims for **10,000 steps** a day.

---

### **Step 2: Steps taken on walks to and from school**
He finished **half of his steps** on these walks.

So:
$$
\text{Steps on walks to/from school} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10,000 = 5,000 \text{ steps}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Steps taken during the short walk with his friend**
He took an additional **1,000 steps** during this walk.

So far, total steps:
$$
5,000 + 1,000 = 6,000 \text{ steps}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Steps remaining after the jog**
After finishing his jog, he had **2,000 steps left** to reach his goal.

That means he had already completed:
$$
10,000 - 2,000 = 8,000 \text{ steps}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Steps taken during the jog**
We already accounted for:
- 5,000 steps (walks to/from school)
- 1,000 steps (short walk with friend)

So steps taken during the jog are:
$$
8,000 - (5,000 + 1,000) = 8,000 - 6,000 = 2,000 \text{ steps}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{2,000} \text{ steps}
$$

Elliott took **2,000 steps** during his jog.
Let's solve this step by step:

---

### **1. Total number of words in the book:**

The book has **45 pages**, and each page has **200 words**.

$$
\text{Total words} = 45 \times 200 = 9000 \text{ words}
$$

---

### **2. Time to read the book:**

Toby reads at a rate of **300 words per minute**.

$$
\text{Reading time} = \frac{9000}{300} = 30 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **3. Total time from now until he arrives at the airport:**

- He needs to be at the airport in **60 minutes**.
- It takes **10 minutes** to get to the airport.
- So, he must leave **60 - 10 = 50 minutes** before his deadline.

---

### **4. How early will Toby arrive?**

- He finishes reading in **30 minutes**.
- He leaves **50 minutes** before the deadline.
- So, he will arrive **50 - 30 = 20 minutes early**.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**Toby will be 20 minutes early.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the number of employees in May**

Carolyn works for a delivery service company that hired **40 employees** in May.

So,  
**Employees in May = 40**

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the total pay per employee in May**

Each employee is paid **$15 per hour** for a **40-hour workweek**.

So,  
**Weekly pay per employee = $15 × 40 hours = $600**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total pay for all employees in May**

There are **40 employees**, each earning **$600 per week**.

So,  
**Total pay in May = 40 × $600 = $24,000**

---

### **Step 4: Determine the number of employees in June**

In June, **1/4 of the employees' contracts expired**.

So,  
**Employees who left = (1/4) × 40 = 10 employees**

Therefore,  
**Employees remaining in June = 40 - 10 = 30 employees**

---

### **Step 5: Calculate the total pay in June**

Each of the remaining **30 employees** still earns **$600 per week**.

So,  
**Total pay in June = 30 × $600 = $18,000**

---

### **Step 6: Calculate total pay for both months**

Now, add the total pay from May and June:

**Total pay = $24,000 (May) + $18,000 (June) = $42,000**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The company paid a total of $42,000 to the employees in the two months.**
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much money Sally has left after her purchases.

---

### **1. Initial amount of money:**
Sally has **$10**.

---

### **2. Taffy purchase:**

The taffy is on sale:  
**"Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."**

So for every **1 pound**, you pay **$3**, and for the **second pound**, you only pay **half price**, which is **$1.50**.

She bought **2 pounds** of taffy.

- First pound: **$3**
- Second pound: **$1.50**

**Total cost for taffy = $3 + $1.50 = $4.50**

---

### **3. Mixed bag of seashells:**

She bought a mixed bag of seashells for **$1.50**

---

### **4. Magnets:**

She bought **4 magnets**, each costing **$0.25**

- Total cost for magnets = 4 × $0.25 = **$1.00**

---

### **5. Total spent:**

Now let’s add up all the costs:

- Taffy: **$4.50**
- Seashells: **$1.50**
- Magnets: **$1.00**

**Total spent = $4.50 + $1.50 + $1.00 = $7.00**

---

### **6. Money left:**

Sally started with **$10**, and she spent **$7.00**

**Money left = $10 - $7.00 = $3.00**

---

### ✅ **Answer: Sally has $3.00 left.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Cost of the first package of fireworks  
Tim buys a package worth **$400**.

---

### Step 2: Cost of the second package of fireworks  
The second package is **twice** the cost of the first one:

$$
2 \times 400 = 800
$$

So, the second package costs **$800**.

---

### Step 3: Total cost before discount  
Add the two packages together:

$$
400 + 800 = 1200
$$

So, before any discount, Tim spent **$1200** on the two packages.

---

### Step 4: Apply the 20% discount  
He gets a **20% discount** on the total of the two packages. Let's calculate that:

$$
20\% \text{ of } 1200 = 0.20 \times 1200 = 240
$$

Subtract the discount from the total:

$$
1200 - 240 = 960
$$

So, after the discount, he spent **$960** on the two packages.

---

### Step 5: Add the cost of the finale firework  
He also buys a finale firework for **$150**.

$$
960 + 150 = 1110
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{1110}
$$

Tim spent **$1110** in total.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **How many cookies does Shannon eat per night?**  
   She eats **2 madeleine cookies a night**.

2. **How many nights is she planning to have cookies?**  
   She wants enough for **30 days**, so that’s **30 nights**.

3. **Total number of cookies needed:**  
   $$
   2 \text{ cookies/night} \times 30 \text{ nights} = 60 \text{ cookies}
   $$

4. **How many cookies does one batch make?**  
   Her recipe makes **1 dozen** (which is **12 cookies**).

5. **How many dozens of cookies does she need to make?**  
   $$
   \frac{60 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 5 \text{ dozen}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Shannon will need to make 5 dozen cookies.**
We are given the following information:

- Marcy makes **50,000 candles**.
- **99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode**, meaning **1% will explode**.
- **5% of the more dangerous candles (i.e., those that explode)** also have a defect that makes them **smell like wet dog**.

We are asked: **How many of the 50,000 candles will both smell like wet dog and explode?**

---

### Step 1: Find how many candles will explode

Since 1% of the candles explode:

$$
\text{Number of exploding candles} = 50,000 \times 0.01 = 500
$$

So, **500 candles will explode**.

---

### Step 2: Find how many of the exploding candles smell like wet dog

We are told that **5% of the exploding candles** also have the wet dog smell:

$$
\text{Number of exploding candles that smell like wet dog} = 500 \times 0.05 = 25
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{25}
$$

So, **25 candles** will both **smell like wet dog and explode**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Regular price per blouse**: $20  
2. **Discount**: 30% off  
3. **Number of blouses picked**: 4  

---

### Step 1: Calculate the discount amount per blouse

$$
\text{Discount} = 30\% \times 20 = 0.30 \times 20 = 6
$$

So, each blouse is discounted by **$6**.

---

### Step 2: Find the discounted price per blouse

$$
\text{Discounted price} = 20 - 6 = 14
$$

Each blouse now costs **$14**.

---

### Step 3: Multiply by the number of blouses

$$
\text{Total cost} = 4 \times 14 = 56
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The total cost of the 4 discounted blouses is $56.**
We are given a scenario involving Joanne and her sister gathering apples from different types of trees. Let's break the problem down step by step.

- **Tallest trees**: Joanne gathers **30 apples**.
- **Shortest trees**: Joanne gathers **half of 30**, which is **15 apples**.
- **Average trees**: Let’s call the number of apples Joanne gathers from average trees **x**.

So, **Joanne’s total** =  
$$
30 \text{ (tallest)} + 15 \text{ (shortest)} + x \text{ (average)} = 45 + x
$$

Now for her **sister**:

- She gathers **twice as many** from the tallest trees:  
  $$
  2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ apples}
  $$

- She gathers **3 times as many** from the shortest trees:  
  $$
  3 \times 15 = 45 \text{ apples}
  $$

- She **does not take any** from the average trees.

So, **sister’s total** =  
$$
60 + 45 = 105
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the Total Apples

We are told that **the combined total** of apples gathered by both sisters is **500**.

So:
$$
\text{Joanne's total} + \text{Sister's total} = 500
$$
$$
(45 + x) + 105 = 500
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for x

$$
45 + x + 105 = 500 \\
150 + x = 500 \\
x = 500 - 150 \\
x = 350
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Joanne gathered 350 apples from the average trees.**
We are given:

- There are **180 heads** in total.
- There are **304 humps** in total.
- **Camels** have **2 humps** each.
- **Dromedaries** have **1 hump** each.

Let’s define:

- Let $ c $ be the number of **camels**.
- Let $ d $ be the number of **dromedaries**.

### Step 1: Set up equations based on the information

From the number of **heads**:

$$
c + d = 180 \tag{1}
$$

From the number of **humps**:

$$
2c + d = 304 \tag{2}
$$

### Step 2: Solve the system of equations

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use **elimination**.

Subtract equation (1) from equation (2):

$$
(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180
$$
$$
2c + d - c - d = 124
$$
$$
c = 124
$$

### Step 3: Find the number of dromedaries

Now substitute $ c = 124 $ into equation (1):

$$
124 + d = 180
$$
$$
d = 180 - 124 = 56
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{56} \text{ dromedaries}
$$
Let's break down the trip step by step and calculate the total distance Tom traveled.

---

### **First 4 days:**
- He traveled **200 kilometers per day**.
- Total for 4 days =  
  $$
  4 \times 200 = 800 \text{ km}
  $$

---

### **Next 2 days (days 5 and 6):**
- He traveled **30% of the distance from the first 4 days**.
- 30% of 800 km =  
  $$
  0.30 \times 800 = 240 \text{ km}
  $$

---

### **Day 7:**
- He **did not travel at all**, so:
  $$
  0 \text{ km}
  $$

---

### **Second week (days 8 to 14):**
- He traveled **300 kilometers every day**.
- That’s 7 days, so:
  $$
  7 \times 300 = 2100 \text{ km}
  $$

---

### **Total Distance:**
Now, sum up all the distances:

$$
\text{First 4 days} + \text{Next 2 days} + \text{Day 7} + \text{Second week}
= 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = \boxed{3140} \text{ km}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **3140 kilometers**
We are given the following relationships:

1. **Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker**  
   So,  
   $$
   \text{Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker}
   $$

2. **Peter's locker is 1/4 as big as Zack's locker**  
   So,  
   $$
   \text{Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker}
   $$

3. **Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches**  
   So,  
   $$
   \text{Peter's locker} = 5
   $$

---

### Step 1: Use Peter's locker to find Zack's locker

From the second relationship:
$$
\text{Peter's locker} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker}
$$
Substitute the value of Peter's locker:
$$
5 = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Zack's locker}
$$
Multiply both sides by 4:
$$
\text{Zack's locker} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cubic inches}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use Zack's locker to find Timothy's locker

From the first relationship:
$$
\text{Zack's locker} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker}
$$
Substitute Zack's locker:
$$
20 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's locker}
$$
Multiply both sides by 2:
$$
\text{Timothy's locker} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ cubic inches}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{40} \text{ cubic inches}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Stanley's elevation**: 10,000 feet  
2. **Elevation of the ledge where the comb fell**: 4,000 feet  
3. **Oliver's elevation**: 3,000 feet  

The comb fell from Stanley’s pocket (at 10,000 feet) and landed on a ledge at **4,000 feet**.

So, the comb is now at **4,000 feet**.

Oliver is currently at **3,000 feet**, and he needs to climb up to reach the **4,000 feet** level where the comb is.

### Calculation:
$$
\text{Distance Oliver must climb} = 4,000 - 3,000 = \boxed{1,000} \text{ feet}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **1,000 feet**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial capital:**  
   Mr. Josue initially had **$5000**.

2. **Money from the first bank:**  
   The first bank gave him **$4000**.

3. **Money from the second bank:**  
   The second bank gave him **twice as much** as the first bank, so:  
   $ 2 \times 4000 = 8000 $

4. **Total money received from both banks:**  
   $ 4000 + 8000 = 12000 $

5. **Total capital now:**  
   Add the initial capital to the money received:  
   $ 5000 + 12000 = 17000 $

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Mr. Josue now has $17,000 in capital.**
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Start with the total number of cats
There were **50 cats** on the rock.

---

### Step 2: Four boats came and carried away 5 cats each

Each boat took **5 cats**, and there were **4 boats**:

$$
4 \text{ boats} \times 5 \text{ cats per boat} = 20 \text{ cats}
$$

So, **20 cats** were taken away.

Now, the number of cats remaining is:

$$
50 - 20 = 30 \text{ cats}
$$

---

### Step 3: 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse

We now have **30 cats** left.  
We are told that **3/5** of them ran after a mouse.

$$
\frac{3}{5} \times 30 = 18 \text{ cats}
$$

So, **18 cats** ran away.

---

### Step 4: Find how many cats are left

Subtract the ones that ran away from the remaining cats:

$$
30 - 18 = 12 \text{ cats}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{12} \text{ cats}
$$
Let's break down the cost of the streaming service over **2 years (24 months)** step by step.

---

### **1. First 6 months:**
- Cost per month: **$8**
- Total for 6 months:  
  $$
  6 \times 8 = \$48
  $$

---

### **2. Next 8 months at normal rate ($12/month):**
- Cost per month: **$12**
- Total for 8 months:  
  $$
  8 \times 12 = \$96
  $$

---

### **3. Remaining months at $14/month:**

So far, we've accounted for:
- 6 months + 8 months = **14 months**

Total time: **24 months**  
Remaining months:  
$$
24 - 14 = 10 \text{ months}
$$

Cost per month: **$14**  
Total for 10 months:  
$$
10 \times 14 = \$140
$$

---

### **4. Total cost for 2 years:**
$$
\$48 + \$96 + \$140 = \$284
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**  
$$
\boxed{\$284}
$$
We are given the following information:

- Cole bought **tattered jeans** and **jogger jeans**.
- The **tattered jeans cost $28**.
- The **jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans**, so:
  $$
  \text{Jogger jeans cost} = 28 - 6 = \$22
  $$
- He saved a total of **$6** on both pairs.
- He saved **1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans**, and the rest from the tattered jeans.

Let’s define the variables clearly:

Let:
- $ T = \text{original price of tattered jeans} = 28 $
- $ J = \text{original price of jogger jeans} = 22 $
- $ S_T = \text{amount saved on tattered jeans} $
- $ S_J = \text{amount saved on jogger jeans} $

We are told:
- Total savings:  
  $$
  S_T + S_J = 6
  $$
- He saved **1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans**, meaning:
  $$
  S_J = \frac{1}{3}(S_T + S_J)
  $$

Now solve this system of equations.

---

### Step 1: Use the second equation

$$
S_J = \frac{1}{3}(S_T + S_J)
$$

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

$$
3S_J = S_T + S_J
$$

Subtract $ S_J $ from both sides:

$$
2S_J = S_T
$$

So:

$$
S_T = 2S_J
$$

---

### Step 2: Plug into the total savings equation

$$
S_T + S_J = 6
$$

Substitute $ S_T = 2S_J $:

$$
2S_J + S_J = 6 \\
3S_J = 6 \\
S_J = 2
$$

Then:

$$
S_T = 2S_J = 2(2) = 4
$$

---

### Step 3: Verify the savings

- Savings on tattered jeans: $ S_T = 4 $
- Savings on jogger jeans: $ S_J = 2 $
- Total savings: $ 4 + 2 = 6 $ ✅
- $ S_J = \frac{1}{3}(S_T + S_J) = \frac{1}{3}(6) = 2 $ ✅

Everything checks out.

---

### Final Answer:

**How much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?**

$$
\text{Tattered jeans} = 28 \\
\text{Jogger jeans} = 22 \\
\text{Difference} = 28 - 22 = \boxed{6}
$$

✅ **Answer: The jogger jeans originally cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many employees can join the day trip based on the number of vehicles and their capacities.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the capacity of each type of vehicle

- **Buses**:  
  There are **4 buses**, each holding **60 employees**.  
  $$
  4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ employees}
  $$

- **Minibuses**:  
  There are **6 minibuses**, each holding **30 employees**.  
  $$
  6 \times 30 = 180 \text{ employees}
  $$

- **Minivans**:  
  There are **10 minivans**, each holding **15 employees**.  
  $$
  10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ employees}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Add up all the capacities

$$
240 + 180 + 150 = 570 \text{ employees}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{570} \text{ employees}
$$

So, **570 employees** can join the day trip.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of bird feeders**

Lillian:
- Builds **3** bird feeders.
- Buys **3** more bird feeders.

So, total number of bird feeders =  
$$
3 \text{ (built)} + 3 \text{ (bought)} = 6 \text{ feeders}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Bird attraction per feeder**

- Each **store-bought** feeder attracts **20 birds**.
- Lillian’s **self-made** feeders attract **10 more birds** than the store-bought ones.

So, each self-made feeder attracts:
$$
20 + 10 = 30 \text{ birds}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Number of self-made and store-bought feeders**

- Self-made feeders: **3**
- Store-bought feeders: **3**

---

### **Step 4: Total number of birds attracted**

Now calculate how many birds are attracted by all feeders:

#### Birds from self-made feeders:
$$
3 \text{ feeders} \times 30 \text{ birds/feeder} = 90 \text{ birds}
$$

#### Birds from store-bought feeders:
$$
3 \text{ feeders} \times 20 \text{ birds/feeder} = 60 \text{ birds}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Total birds in the garden each day**

$$
90 \text{ (from self-made)} + 60 \text{ (from store-bought)} = \boxed{150} \text{ birds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{150} \text{ birds}
$$
Let's break down the costs step by step:

---

### 1. **Cost of the bagel**  
The bagel costs:  
$$
\$4
$$

---

### 2. **Cost of the soup**  
The soup costs **25% more** than the bagel.

To find 25% of the bagel price:
$$
25\% \text{ of } \$4 = 0.25 \times 4 = \$1
$$

So, the cost of the soup is:
$$
\$4 + \$1 = \$5
$$

---

### 3. **Cost of the cake**  
The cake costs **half the price of the bagel**:
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times \$4 = \$2
$$

---

### 4. **Total cost**  
Now, add up all the items:
$$
\text{Bagel} + \text{Soup} + \text{Cake} = \$4 + \$5 + \$2 = \$11
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$11}
$$

Aleksandra needed to pay **\$11** for her dinner.
We are told:

- Kenny wants to buy a **$100 ticket** to an amusement park.
- He sells his **Pokémon cards** at **$1.50 each**.
- He **keeps 1/3 of the cards** for himself.
- After selling the rest, he has **$50 in spending cash**.
- We need to find out how many **cards he started with**.

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let $ x $ be the total number of cards Kenny started with.

He keeps $ \frac{1}{3}x $ cards for himself, so he sells:

$$
x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \text{ cards}
$$

He sells these at **$1.50 per card**, so the money he gets from selling is:

$$
\frac{2}{3}x \times 1.50
$$

He ends up with **$50 in spending cash**, which means the money from selling the cards equals $50.

So we can write the equation:

$$
\frac{2}{3}x \times 1.50 = 50
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve the equation

$$
\frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = 50
$$

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator:

$$
2x \times 1.5 = 150
$$

Now multiply:

$$
3x = 150
$$

Divide both sides by 3:

$$
x = 50
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Kenny started with 50 Pokémon cards.**
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original plan**

- The caterer was told to prepare hot dogs for **36 guests**.
- He prepared enough so that **half of the guests** could have **two hot dogs**.
- That means:
  - Half of 36 = **18 guests**
  - Each of these 18 guests would get **2 hot dogs**
  - So, total hot dogs prepared = $ 18 \times 2 = 36 $ hot dogs

So, the caterer originally prepared **36 hot dogs**.

---

### **Step 2: What actually happened?**

- **40 guests showed up**, not 36.
- **Everyone wanted a second hotdog** (i.e., every guest wants **2 hotdogs**).

So, with 40 guests and each wanting 2 hotdogs:

- Total hotdogs needed = $ 40 \times 2 = 80 $ hotdogs

But the caterer only had **36 hotdogs** prepared.

---

### **Step 3: How many guests did NOT get a second hotdog?**

We need to find out how many guests were **not able to get a second hotdog** because there weren't enough hotdogs.

- Total number of guests = 40
- Total hotdogs available = 36
- Each guest gets **at least one hotdog**, and we want to know how many **did not get a second**.

Let’s assume all guests got **at least one hotdog**. Then the remaining hotdogs can be distributed as second hotdogs.

- First hotdog for all 40 guests = 40 hotdogs
- Hotdogs left = $ 36 - 40 = -4 $

Wait — this is negative. That means the caterer didn’t even have enough for **one hotdog per guest**!

So he couldn’t give even one hotdog to everyone.

That tells us that the caterer **only had 36 hotdogs**, and there were **40 guests**.

So, at most, **36 guests** could get **one hotdog each**, and the other **4 guests** got **nothing**.

Therefore, **no one got a second hotdog**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**0 guests** did not get a second hotdog.

Actually, **all 40 guests did not get a second hotdog**, because there weren’t enough hotdogs for even one hotdog per guest.

So, the correct answer is:

> **40 guests did not get a second hotdog.**

But if the question is asking **how many guests did not get a second hotdog**, then the answer is:

> **All 40 guests did not get a second hotdog.**

So, the final answer is:

> ✅ **40 guests did not get a second hotdog.**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of letters in Indras' name
Indras has **6** letters.

### Step 2: Find half of the letters in Indras' name
Half of 6 is:
$$
\frac{6}{2} = 3
$$

### Step 3: Add 4 more letters to that amount
Her sister's name has **4 more letters** than half of Indras' name:
$$
3 + 4 = 7
$$

So, her sister's name has **7** letters.

### Step 4: Add the number of letters in both names
Indras: 6 letters  
Sister: 7 letters  
Total:
$$
6 + 7 = 13
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**13 letters** in total.
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **List of items and their original prices:**
- **Set of pot and pans:** $120.00  
- **Set of mixing bowls:** $20.00  
- **5 separate utensils at $5.00 each:**  
  $ 5 \times 5 = \$25.00 $

### 2. **Total original price:**
$$
\$120.00 + \$20.00 + \$25.00 = \$165.00
$$

### 3. **Apply the 20% discount:**
A 20% discount means Charlotte pays **80%** of the original price.

$$
\text{Discounted total} = 165.00 \times 0.80 = \$132.00
$$

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$132.00}
$$

So, Charlotte’s order came to **\$132.00** after the 20% discount.
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Find the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy.
- Skipping rope: $6  
- Board game: $11  
- Playground ball: $2  

**Total cost = $6 + $11 + $2 = $19**

---

### Step 2: Find out how much money Dora already has.
- She saved: $2  
- Her mother gave her: $16  

**Total money she has = $2 + $16 = $18**

---

### Step 3: Calculate how much more money she needs.

**Money needed = Total cost - Money she has**  
= $19 - $18 = **$1**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Dora needs $1 more** to buy all the items.
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many dragons **Prince Thaddeus** slew.

> Prince Thaddeus slew **100 dragons**.

So:

$$
\text{Thaddeus} = 100
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many dragons **Prince Arthur** slew.

> Prince Arthur slew **three quarters as many** dragons as Prince Thaddeus.

That means:

$$
\text{Arthur} = \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine how many dragons **Prince Walter** slew.

> Prince Walter slew **twice as many** dragons as Prince Arthur.

$$
\text{Walter} = 2 \times 75 = 150
$$

---

### Step 4: Determine how many dragons **Prince Bruce** slew.

> Prince Bruce slew **one-fifth as many** dragons as Prince Walter.

$$
\text{Bruce} = \frac{1}{5} \times 150 = 30
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{30}
$$

**Prince Bruce slew 30 dragons.**
Let's solve this step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Determine how much gas is in each container**

We are told that **15 gallons** of gas were equally divided into **5 containers**.

So, the amount of gas in each container is:

$$
\frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5} = 3 \text{ gallons per container}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find out how much gas Josey needed**

Josey needed **1/4 of a container** of gas. Since each container has **3 gallons**, we calculate:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Convert gallons to pints**

We know that:

$$
1 \text{ gallon} = 8 \text{ pints}
$$

So,

$$
\frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ pints}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline.**
We are given:

- Chips cost **40 cents** each.
- Candy bars cost **75 cents** each.
- George spent **$5**, which is **500 cents**.
- He bought **3 bags of chips**.
- After spending, he had **1% of his money left**.

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Convert everything to cents
George had **$5 = 500 cents**.

He had **1% of his money left**, so:
$$
\text{Money left} = 1\% \times 500 = 0.01 \times 500 = 5 \text{ cents}
$$

So, the amount George **spent** is:
$$
500 - 5 = 495 \text{ cents}
$$

---

### Step 2: Cost of chips
He bought **3 bags of chips**, and each chip costs **40 cents**:
$$
\text{Cost of chips} = 3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ cents}
$$

---

### Step 3: Subtract cost of chips from total spent
$$
\text{Remaining money spent on candy bars} = 495 - 120 = 375 \text{ cents}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find number of candy bars
Each candy bar costs **75 cents**, so:
$$
\text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{375}{75} = 5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{5}
$$

George bought **5 candy bars**.
Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Total lollipops Ray had:**  
   $ 25 $

2. **Lollipops Ray kept for himself:**  
   $ 5 $

3. **Lollipops left to share with friends:**  
   $ 25 - 5 = 20 $

4. **Number of friends:**  
   $ 4 $

5. **Lollipops each friend received:**  
   $ \frac{20}{4} = 5 $

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Each friend received 5 lollipops.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total weight of the cake**:  
   The cake weighs **20 ounces**.

2. **Number of pieces**:  
   The cake is cut into **8 equal pieces**.

3. **Weight of each piece**:  
   To find the weight of one piece, divide the total weight by the number of pieces:  
   $$
   \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8} = 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece}
   $$

4. **Number of pieces eaten**:  
   Rory and her mom each had **1 piece**, so that’s:  
   $$
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ pieces}
   $$

5. **Total weight of eaten pieces**:  
   $$
   2 \text{ pieces} \times 2.5 \text{ ounces per piece} = 5 \text{ ounces}
   $$

6. **Remaining cake weight**:  
   Subtract the weight of the eaten pieces from the total weight:  
   $$
   20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **15 ounces**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Total number of oranges**

Sitti has **34** oranges, and Juris has **22** oranges.

So, the total number of oranges is:

$$
34 + 22 = 56 \text{ oranges}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Total number of people sharing**

Sitti and Juris are sharing with **6 other friends**, so the total number of people is:

$$
2 + 6 = 8 \text{ people}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Divide the oranges equally among all 8 people**

To find how many oranges each person gets, divide the total number of oranges by the number of people:

$$
\frac{56}{8} = 7
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Each person will get 7 oranges.**
Let's break this down step by step to find the **cost per serving**.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many pounds of onions Antoine uses**

- The recipe calls for **2 pounds of onions**, but he **doubles** that amount.
- So, he uses:  
  $$
  2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the cost of the onions**

- Onions are on sale for **$2.00 per pound**.
- Total cost for onions:  
  $$
  4 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the cost of the beef stock**

- He needs **2 boxes** of beef stock.
- Each box costs **$2.00**.
- Total cost for beef stock:  
  $$
  2 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00/\text{box} = \$4.00
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Find the total cost of the ingredients**

- Total cost = Cost of onions + Cost of beef stock  
  $$
  \$8.00 + \$4.00 = \$12.00
  $$

---

### **Step 5: Divide by the number of servings**

- The soup serves **6 people**.
- Cost per serving:  
  $$
  \frac{\$12.00}{6} = \$2.00
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$2}
$$

So, the **cost per serving is \$2** (rounded to the nearest integer).
We are given the following information:

- **Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.**
- **The drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel.**
- **It takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.**

We are asked: **How much earlier should Bernadette leave than Wayne to get to the theater first?**

---

### Step 1: Determine the time it takes for Bernadette to drive to the theater

We're told that the drive from **Bernadette’s apartment** takes **four times as long** as the drive from **Wayne’s hotel**.

So, if it takes Wayne **4 minutes** to drive to the theater, then:

$$
\text{Time for Bernadette} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 2: Understand the goal

Bernadette wants to **arrive 5 minutes before Wayne**.

Let’s define:

- Let $ t $ be the amount of time **before Wayne** that **Bernadette leaves**.
- That means **Bernadette leaves $ t $ minutes earlier** than Wayne.
- Since Bernadette's drive takes 16 minutes and Wayne's takes 4 minutes, we want her arrival time to be 5 minutes earlier than Wayne's.

So, let’s set up an equation based on arrival times.

Let’s assume both start driving at the same time (i.e., Wayne starts driving at time 0).

- **Wayne arrives at time:** $ 4 $ minutes
- **Bernadette arrives at time:** $ t + 16 $ minutes (since she leaves $ t $ minutes earlier)

We want her to arrive **5 minutes earlier** than Wayne:

$$
t + 16 = 4 - 5
$$

$$
t + 16 = -1
$$

$$
t = -17
$$

This result doesn't make sense in the context — we can’t have a negative time. So let’s re-express this more carefully.

---

### Step 3: Re-evaluate with correct logic

Let’s think about **when they both start driving**.

Suppose:

- Wayne starts driving at time **0**, and arrives at **time 4**.
- Bernadette wants to arrive **5 minutes before Wayne**, so she must arrive at **time 4 - 5 = -1**.

That means **she needs to arrive at time -1**, i.e., **1 minute before Wayne even starts**.

But she takes **16 minutes** to drive. So she must start driving **17 minutes before Wayne** to arrive at the same time as Wayne minus 5 minutes.

So:

$$
\text{Bernadette must leave } 17 \text{ minutes earlier than Wayne}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{17} \text{ minutes}
$$

Bernadette should leave **17 minutes earlier** than Wayne to arrive 5 minutes before him.
We are given:

- **Area of the room** = 360 square feet  
- **Length of the room** = 3 yards  
- We need to find the **perimeter in feet**

---

### Step 1: Convert the length from yards to feet

Since:
$$
1 \text{ yard} = 3 \text{ feet}
$$

So,
$$
3 \text{ yards} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the area formula to find the width

The formula for the area of a rectangle is:
$$
\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width}
$$

We know:
- Area = 360 sq ft
- Length = 9 ft

Substitute into the formula:
$$
360 = 9 \times \text{width}
$$

Solve for width:
$$
\text{width} = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the perimeter

Perimeter of a rectangle is:
$$
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
$$

Substitute values:
$$
P = 2 \times (9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{98} \text{ feet}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many more beads **one sister has than the other**.

---

### Step 1: Understand what we know

- Each pack contains **20 beads**.
- Elizabeth bought:
  - 1 pack of **red** beads
  - 2 packs of **clear** beads
- Margareth bought:
  - 3 packs of **blue** beads
  - 4 packs of **red** beads

We are not told how many beads are in each color, but since **each pack contains 20 beads**, we can calculate the total number of beads for each sister based on the number of packs they bought.

---

### Step 2: Calculate total beads for each sister

#### Elizabeth:
- 1 pack of red = 1 × 20 = **20 beads**
- 2 packs of clear = 2 × 20 = **40 beads**
- **Total for Elizabeth = 20 + 40 = 60 beads**

#### Margareth:
- 3 packs of blue = 3 × 20 = **60 beads**
- 4 packs of red = 4 × 20 = **80 beads**
- **Total for Margareth = 60 + 80 = 140 beads**

---

### Step 3: Find the difference

Now, subtract the smaller total from the larger one:

$$
140 - 60 = \boxed{80}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.**
Let's break the problem down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Initial Temperature**
Marcus wakes up and the house is at:

$$
40^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 2: Baking for 3 Hours**
The oven is on for **3 hours**, and it raises the temperature by **5 degrees per hour**.

So, the temperature increase during baking is:

$$
3 \text{ hours} \times 5^\circ/\text{hour} = 15^\circ
$$

Now the temperature becomes:

$$
40^\circ + 15^\circ = 55^\circ
$$

---

### **Step 3: Cooling Down by Opening a Window**
Marcus opens a window for **30 minutes**. The house cools down **2 degrees every 10 minutes**.

So, in 30 minutes, the number of 10-minute intervals is:

$$
30 \div 10 = 3
$$

Therefore, the total cooling is:

$$
3 \times 2^\circ = 6^\circ
$$

Now subtract that from the current temperature:

$$
55^\circ - 6^\circ = 49^\circ
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{49^\circ}
$$
Let's solve the problem **step by step**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate Jon's total time

Jon's times:
- Swim: 40 minutes  
- Bike: 1 hour 20 minutes = 80 minutes  
- Run: 50 minutes  

So, Jon's **total time** is:

$$
40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine James's swim time

James finishes the **swim 10% faster** than Jon.

Jon’s swim time = 40 minutes  
10% of 40 minutes = $ 0.10 \times 40 = 4 $ minutes  
So, James's swim time = $ 40 - 4 = 36 $ minutes

---

### Step 3: Determine James's bike time

James takes **5 minutes longer** on the bike than Jon.

Jon’s bike time = 80 minutes  
James’s bike time = $ 80 + 5 = 85 $ minutes

---

### Step 4: Find James's total time

We are told that **Jon won by 10 minutes**, so James took **10 minutes longer** than Jon.

Jon’s total time = 170 minutes  
So, James’s total time = $ 170 + 10 = 180 $ minutes

---

### Step 5: Find James's run time

We already know:
- James’s swim time = 36 minutes  
- James’s bike time = 85 minutes  
- James’s total time = 180 minutes  

So, James’s **run time** is:

$$
180 - (36 + 85) = 180 - 121 = \boxed{59} \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{59} \text{ minutes}
$$
We are given the following information:

1. **Movie C was 1.25 hours long.**  
   - Convert this to minutes:  
     $$
     1.25 \text{ hours} = 1.25 \times 60 = 75 \text{ minutes}
     $$

2. **Movie B was 5 minutes longer than Movie C.**  
   - So,  
     $$
     \text{Length of Movie B} = 75 + 5 = 80 \text{ minutes}
     $$

3. **Movie A was one-fourth the length of Movie B.**  
   - So,  
     $$
     \text{Length of Movie A} = \frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \text{ minutes}
     $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{20} \text{ minutes}
$$
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how far the horse runs in 30 minutes**

- The horse runs at **32 miles per hour**.
- In **30 minutes**, which is **0.5 hours**, the horse runs:

$$
\text{Distance} = 32 \, \text{mph} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 16 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how much hay the horse eats**

- For **every mile**, the horse eats **½ a bail of hay**.
- So for **16 miles**, the horse eats:

$$
16 \, \text{miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \, \text{bail/mile} = 8 \, \text{bails of hay}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the cost of the hay**

- Each **bail of hay costs $3**.
- So for **8 bails**, the total cost is:

$$
8 \, \text{bails} \times 3 \, \text{\$/bail} = 24 \, \text{\$}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate Michael’s change**

- Michael has **six $5 bills**, so he has:

$$
6 \times 5 = 30 \, \text{\$}
$$

- He spends **$24** on hay, so his change is:

$$
30 - 24 = 6 \, \text{\$}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Michael has $6 in change after buying the hay.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Total number of eggs
- Rozanne uses **4 dozen eggs** from cases.  
  - 1 dozen = 12 eggs, so  
  - 4 dozen = $ 4 \times 12 = 48 $ eggs

- She also uses **2 loose eggs** from the cupboard.

So, total eggs used:
$$
48 + 2 = 50 \text{ eggs}
$$

---

### Step 2: How many glasses can be made with 50 eggs?
Each glass requires **5 eggs**, so:

$$
\frac{50}{5} = 10 \text{ glasses}
$$

---

### Step 3: How many trays can she put out?
Each tray holds **5 glasses** of eggnog.

$$
\frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ trays}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Rozanne can put out 2 trays.**

1. **Joey's initial points**: 214  
2. **Joey scores 26 points**:  
   $$
   214 + 26 = 240
   $$  
   So, Joey now has **240 points**.

3. **Marcy's initial points**: 225  
4. **Marcy scores 10 points**:  
   $$
   225 + 10 = 235
   $$  
   So, Marcy now has **235 points**.

5. **Now find the difference between Joey's and Marcy's points**:  
   $$
   240 - 235 = 5
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **Joey is winning by 5 points.**
Let's break this down step by step to find the **salesman's profit**.

---

### **Step 1: Total Cost of the Sneakers**
The salesman bought a case of **48 sneakers** for **$576**.

So, the **total cost** is:

$$
\text{Total Cost} = \$576
$$

---

### **Step 2: Revenue from Monday's Flash Sale**

He sold **17 sneakers** at **$20 each** on Monday.

$$
\text{Revenue from Monday} = 17 \times 20 = \$340
$$

---

### **Step 3: Revenue from the Rest of the Week**

He sold the remaining sneakers to a department store.  
Total sneakers = 48  
Sneakers sold on Monday = 17  
Remaining sneakers = $ 48 - 17 = 31 $

He sold those **31 sneakers** at **$25 each**.

$$
\text{Revenue from rest of the week} = 31 \times 25 = \$775
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total Revenue**

$$
\text{Total Revenue} = \$340 + \$775 = \$1115
$$

---

### **Step 5: Profit**

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

$$
\text{Profit} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$539}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the problem
Beatrice bought **10 packets** of crayons.  
- **6 packets** had **8 pieces** each.  
- **4 packets** had **16 pieces** each.  

We are asked to find the **total number of crayons** she bought, which is the **total number of pieces** in all the packets.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total from the first group

There are 6 packets with 8 pieces each:

$$
6 \times 8 = 48 \text{ pieces}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total from the second group

There are 4 packets with 16 pieces each:

$$
4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ pieces}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add both totals together

$$
48 + 64 = 112
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Beatrice bought a total of **112 crayons**.
We are given:

- **Super ticket price:** $20  
  - Includes: Any movie, **1 popcorn + 1 soda** for **$1 extra**
- **Regular ticket price:** $12  
  - You buy **popcorn and soda separately**, with the **soda costing $3**
- You **didn’t buy the super ticket**, but **saved $2**

We are asked to find the **regular price of popcorn**.

---

### Step 1: Understand what you paid without the super ticket

You bought a regular movie ticket for **$12**, and then bought **popcorn and soda at regular prices**.

Let’s define:

- Let **P** = regular price of popcorn
- Soda costs **$3**

So total cost without the super ticket is:

$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{ticket} + \text{popcorn} + \text{soda} = 12 + P + 3 = 15 + P
$$

---

### Step 2: What would you have paid with the super ticket?

With the super ticket:

- Price = $20
- Includes **1 popcorn + 1 soda** for **$1 extra**
- So total cost = $20

---

### Step 3: You saved $2 by not buying the super ticket

This means:

$$
\text{Cost without super ticket} = \text{Cost with super ticket} + \text{Savings}
$$

Substitute values:

$$
15 + P = 20 + 2
$$

$$
15 + P = 22
$$

$$
P = 22 - 15 = 7
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\$7}
$$

The **regular price of popcorn is $7**.
We are given the following information:

- On a certain day, **20 helium balloons** cost **$900**.
- Two days later, the **cost per balloon increased by $20**.
- Bentley went to fill **170 balloons** after the price increase.
- We are to find how much **Bentley paid** for 170 balloons.

---

### Step 1: Find the original cost per balloon

We are told that 20 balloons cost $900.  
So the cost per balloon is:

$$
\frac{900}{20} = 45 \text{ dollars per balloon}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the new cost per balloon after the increase

The cost per balloon increased by $20:

$$
45 + 20 = 65 \text{ dollars per balloon}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for 170 balloons at the new price

$$
170 \times 65 = ?
$$

Let’s calculate:

$$
170 \times 65 = (170 \times 60) + (170 \times 5)
= 10,200 + 850 = 11,050
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\$11,050}
$$

Bentley paid **\$11,050** to fill 170 balloons after the price increase.
To find the **average speed** of the car during the entire trip, we use the formula:

$$
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
$$

---

### Step 1: Calculate the distance for each part of the trip

- **First part**:  
  Speed = 60 mph  
  Time = 2 hours  
  Distance = $ 60 \times 2 = 120 $ miles

- **Second part**:  
  Speed = 30 mph  
  Time = 1 hour  
  Distance = $ 30 \times 1 = 30 $ miles

---

### Step 2: Add up the total distance and total time

- **Total Distance** = $ 120 + 30 = 150 $ miles  
- **Total Time** = $ 2 + 1 = 3 $ hours

---

### Step 3: Calculate average speed

$$
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{150}{3} = 50 \text{ mph}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**50 mph** is the car's average speed during the trip.

We are given the following information about the number of cards in a set:

1. There are **15 red cards**.
2. There are **60% more green cards** than red cards.
3. The number of **yellow cards is equal to the sum of red and green cards**.

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of green cards

We know that there are **60% more green cards** than red cards.

- Number of red cards = 15  
- 60% of 15 = $ 0.6 \times 15 = 9 $

So, the number of green cards = red cards + 60% more  
$$
\text{Green cards} = 15 + 9 = 24
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the number of yellow cards

Yellow cards = sum of red and green cards  
$$
\text{Yellow cards} = 15 + 24 = 39
$$

---

### Step 3: Total number of cards

Now, add up all the cards:
$$
\text{Total cards} = \text{Red} + \text{Green} + \text{Yellow} = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78

Let's break down the problem step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Initial number of fairies**

Katelyn saw **50 fairies** flying above the forest.

So, initially, there are:
> **50 fairies**

---

### **Step 2: Fairies seen by her friend from the east**

After about **20 minutes**, one of Katelyn’s friends saw **half as many fairies** as Katelyn saw come from the **east** and join the existing fairies.

- Half of 50 is:
  $$
  \frac{50}{2} = 25
  $$

So, **25 more fairies** joined the original 50.

Now total fairies:
$$
50 + 25 = 75
$$

---

### **Step 3: Fairies flew away**

Then, **10 minutes later**, **30 fairies flew away**.

So we subtract 30 from the current total:
$$
75 - 30 = 45
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{45}
$$

**There are 45 fairies remaining.**
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Find the total number of puppies
- Jennifer's dog has **8** puppies.
- Brandon's dog has **12** puppies.

So, the **total number of puppies** is:
$$
8 + 12 = 20
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the total number of puppies with spots
- Jennifer's dog has **3** spotted puppies.
- Brandon's dog has **4** spotted puppies.

So, the **total number of spotted puppies** is:
$$
3 + 4 = 7
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage of puppies with spots
We use the formula for percentage:
$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of spotted puppies}}{\text{Total number of puppies}} \right) \times 100
$$

Substitute the values:
$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{7}{20} \right) \times 100 = 35\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**35%** of all the puppies have spots.
Let's break this down step by step to determine how many trips the farmer needs to make with his 2250-pound capacity truck.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total weight of each type of feed**

#### **Sugar Cubes**
- 2 boxes × 1 pound = **2 pounds**

#### **Carrots**
- 4 bags × 12 pounds = **48 pounds**

#### **Hay**
- 42 bales × 75 pounds =  
  $ 42 \times 75 = 3150 $ pounds

#### **Oats**
- 20 sacks × 65 pounds =  
  $ 20 \times 65 = 1300 $ pounds

---

### **Step 2: Add up all the weights**

$$
\text{Total weight} = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine how many trips are needed**

The truck can carry **2250 pounds** at a time.

$$
\text{Number of trips} = \left\lceil \frac{4500}{2250} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 2 \right\rceil = 2

So, total basketball cards =  
$$
6 \times 25 = 150
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total number of baseball cards**

She also has:
- 5 boxes
- Each box contains 40 baseball cards

So, total baseball cards =  
$$
5 \times 40 = 200

Let's break this down step by step to find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate what Becky paid**

- Becky bought **20 apples** at **45 cents each**.
- So, the total cost before discount is:

$$
20 \times 0.45 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

- She received a **$1 discount**, so her final cost is:

$$
9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate what Kelly paid**

- Kelly bought **20 apples** at **50 cents each**.
- So, the total cost before discount is:

$$
20 \times 0.50 = 10.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

- She received a **10% discount** on the total cost:
  
$$
10\% \text{ of } 10.00 = 0.10 \times 10.00 = 1.00 \text{ dollar}
$$

- So, Kelly's final cost is:

$$
10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the difference**

Now, subtract Becky’s total from Kelly’s total:

$$
9.00 - 8.00 = 1.00 \text{ dollar}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Kelly paid $1.00 more than Becky.**
Let's break this down step by step to find the total number of **pieces of laundry** in **80 rooms**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the items per room

Each room has:

- **2 sheets**
- **1 comforter**
- **Twice as many pillow cases as sheets**
- **Twice as many towels as pillow cases**

---

### Step 2: Express all quantities in terms of sheets

Let’s define:

- Sheets = 2  
- Comforter = 1  
- Pillow cases = 2 × sheets = 2 × 2 = **4**

So, per room, we have:

- Sheets: 2  
- Comforter: 1  
- Pillow cases: 4  
- Towels: 8

---

### Step 3: Total laundry per room

Add them up:

$$
2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15 \text{ pieces of laundry per room}
$$

---

### Step 4: Multiply by the number of rooms

There are **80 rooms**, so:

$$
15 \times 80 = 1200
$$

---

- Subtract $1 → $6 - $1 = **$5**

So, the paper costs **$5**.

---

### Step 3: Find the total cost
- Pen: $2  
- Paper: $5  
- Total = $2 + $5 = **$7**

---

### Step 4: Calculate the change

---

### **Step 1: Total number of pencils at the start**

There are **30 students**, and each student started with **10 pencils**.

$$
\text{Total pencils} = 30 \times 10 = 300 \text{ pencils}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Pencils used after two months**

After two months, **1/5 of the total pencils** were used.

$$
\text{Pencils used} = \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \text{ pencils}
$$

$$
\text{Pencils remaining after two months} = 300 - 60 = 240 \text{ pencils}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Pencils left at the end of the year**

At the end of the year, **only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left**. That means **2/3 of the pencils were used** in the last part of the year.

So we calculate how many pencils were **left**:

$$
\text{Pencils left} = \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \text{ pencils}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{80} \text{ pencils}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationship
Matt can have:

- **Half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats**, plus  
- **2 extra cookies for cleaning his room.**

So, if Matt eats **x** carrot sticks, then he can eat:

$$
\text{Cookies} = \frac{1}{2}x + 2
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the given information
We are told that **Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total**. So we set up the equation:

$$
\frac{1}{2}x + 2 = 5
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve the equation

Subtract 2 from both sides:

$$
\frac{1}{2}x = 3
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
x = 6
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Matt has to eat **6 carrot sticks**.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- **Shark length**: 10 feet  
- **Remoras attached**: 2 remoras, each **6 inches long**

### Step 2: Convert units to be consistent
We need to work with the same unit for both the shark and the remoras. Since the shark is measured in **feet**, we'll convert the remoras from **inches** to **feet**.

- 1 foot = 12 inches  
- So, 6 inches = $ \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 $ feet

### Step 3: Find the total length of the remoras
There are 2 remoras, each 0.5 feet long:

$$
\text{Total remora length} = 2 \times 0.5 = 1 \text{ foot}
$$

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras take up
Use the formula for percentage:

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
$$

Here:
- Part = Total remora length = 1 foot  
- Whole = Shark length = 10 feet

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{1}{10} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.**
We are told that **three-fourths** of the students have a desktop computer at home, and **20 students do not**. We need to find the total number of students.

---

### Step 1: Let the total number of students be $ x $

- Three-fourths of the students have a desktop computer:  
  $$
  \frac{3}{4}x
  $$

- The remaining one-fourth do **not** have a desktop computer:  
  $$
  \frac{1}{4}x
  $$

We are told that the number of students who **do not** have a desktop computer is **20**.

So:
$$
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

Multiply both sides by 4:
$$
x = 20 \times 4 = 80
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{80}
$$

$$

### 5. **Walking time per day:**  
Now divide the total walking time by the number of walking days:
$$
\text{Minutes per day} = \frac{240 \, \text{minutes}}{12 \, \text{days}} = 20 \, \text{minutes/day}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
Jason needs to walk **20 minutes each day**.
Let's solve this step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Find the total number of books Sarah bought.**

She spent **$300** in total, and each book cost **$15**.

$$
\text{Total number of books} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Price per book}} = \frac{300}{15} = 20
$$

So, Sarah bought **20 books**.

---

### **Step 2: Divide the books equally among her 4 kids.**

$$
\text{Books per child} = \frac{\text{Total number of books}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Each child got 5 books.**
We are given:

- 9 kids are allergic to **dairy**
- 6 kids are allergic to **peanuts**
- 3 kids are allergic to **both** dairy and peanuts
- Total number of kids in the class = 32

We need to find how many kids are **not allergic to anything**.

---

### Step 1: Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion

Let’s define:

- $ D $ = set of kids allergic to **dairy**
- $ P $ = set of kids allergic to **peanuts**

We are given:

- $ |D| = 9 $
- $ |P| = 6 $
- $ |D \cap P| = 3 $

Using the formula for the union of two sets:

$$
|D \cup P| = |D| + |P| - |D \cap P|
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
|D \cup P| = 9 + 6 - 3 = 12
$$

So, **12 kids** are allergic to **either dairy, peanuts, or both**.

---

### Step 2: Subtract from total to find those not allergic to anything

Total number of kids in the class = 32  
Number of kids allergic to at least one = 12

So, the number of kids **not allergic to anything** is:

$$
32 - 12 = \boxed{20}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{20}
$$ kids are **not allergic to anything**.

4. **Amount saved per day:** $2  

5. **Number of days needed to save the remaining amount:**  
   $$
   \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ days}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: It will take him **4 days** to save the remaining money.
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Each tray can hold 24 eggs.**  
   So, with **2 trays**, the total number of eggs that can be placed is:  
   $$
   2 \text{ trays} \times 24 \text{ eggs/tray} = 48 \text{ eggs}
   $$

2. **Jaime has 64 eggs.**  
   He wants to place them on the trays.

3. **Subtract the number of eggs that can fit on the trays from the total number of eggs:**  
   $$
   64 \text{ eggs} - 48 \text{ eggs} = 16 \text{ eggs}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **16 eggs** won't fit on the tray.
Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the small pizza**:  
   The small pizza costs **$8**.

2. **Cost of the family-size pizza**:  
   It costs **3 times as much** as the small pizza.  
   So, we multiply:  
   $ 3 \times 8 = 24 $

3. **Total cost**:  
   Add the cost of both pizzas:  
   $ 8 + 24 = 32 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **$32**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much **each individual razor** will cost in **cents** after all the discounts.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the original price per pack**
- Each pack contains **4 razors**.
- Each pack costs **$4.00**.

So, the **price per razor** without any discounts is:

$$
\frac{\$4.00}{4 \text{ razors}} = \$1.00 \text{ per razor}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Apply the "Buy One Get One Free" sale**

She buys **2 packs**, but with the **buy one get one free** deal, she only pays for **1 pack** and gets **2 packs** total.

So:
- She pays for **1 pack** → $4.00
- She gets **2 packs** → 8 razors

---

### **Step 3: Apply the $2.00 coupon**

She has a **$2.00 coupon**, so subtract that from the price of the 1 pack she paid for:

$$
\$4.00 - \$2.00 = \$2.00
$$

So now, she effectively pays **$2.00** for **8 razors**.

---

### **Step 4: Find the cost per razor**

Now divide the total amount paid by the number of razors:

$$
\frac{\$2.00}{8 \text{ razors}} = \$0.25 \text{ per razor}
$$

Convert to **cents**:

$$
\$0.25 = 25 \text{ cents}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**25 cents per razor** after all discounts.
Let's break this down step by step to find the **height of the human pyramid** in **feet**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the structure of the pyramid**

The pyramid is built as follows:

- **Bottom layer:** 4 girls
- **Second layer:** 3 girls
- **Third layer:** 2 girls
- **Top layer:** 1 girl (the shortest)

So, the total number of girls is:

$$
4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 \text{ girls}
$$

Perfect — that matches the 10 cheerleaders mentioned.

---

### **Step 2: Heights of the cheerleaders**

We are told:

- **9 out of 10 cheerleaders are 64" tall**
- The **10th cheerleader is 60" tall**

So, the heights are:

- 9 girls = **64 inches**
- 1 girl = **60 inches**

Now, we need to determine which cheerleader is at the top of the pyramid (the shortest one), and then calculate the **total height** of the pyramid.

---

### **Step 3: Determine who is on each level**

Since the **shortest girl is at the top**, that must be the **60-inch girl**.

So the layers are:

- **Bottom (4 girls):** 3 girls of 64", 1 girl of 64"
- **Second layer (3 girls):** 2 girls of 64", 1 girl of 64"
- **Third layer (2 girls):** 1 girl of 64", 1 girl of 64"
- **Top (1 girl):** 1 girl of **60"**

But wait — for a human pyramid, the **height of the pyramid** is not just the sum of all individual heights. It’s the **sum of the heights of each layer**, where each layer is stacked **on top of the previous one**.

So, we treat each layer as a horizontal platform, and the **total height of the pyramid** is the **sum of the heights of all layers**.

Each layer consists of multiple girls, but they are standing on top of each other. So we can assume that each layer contributes its **average height** or **just the height of the tallest girl in that layer**, depending on how it's structured.

However, since the question doesn’t specify stacking vertically or horizontally, and given the way the problem is phrased, we will interpret it as:

> Each layer is **one level** of the pyramid, and the height of the pyramid is the **sum of the heights of each layer**, with each layer being the **height of the tallest girl in that layer**.

So we now identify the **tallest girl in each layer**:

- **Bottom layer (4 girls):** All are 64" → **64"**
- **Second layer (3 girls):** All are 64" → **64"**
- **Third layer (2 girls):** All are 64" → **64"**
- **Top layer (1 girl):** 60" → **60"**

Now, add these up:

$$
64 + 64 + 64 + 60 = 252 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Convert inches to feet**

$$
252 \div 12 = 21 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{21 \text{ feet}}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Charisma works 8 hours every day.**  
   - That means she is at work for **8 hours per day**.

2. **She walks for 5 minutes every hour she’s at work.**  
   - So, for each of the 8 hours she works, she walks for **5 minutes**.

3. **Calculate how many minutes she walks in one day:**  
   $$
   8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ minutes/hour} = 40 \text{ minutes/day}
   $$

4. **She does this for 5 days.**  
   $$
   40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Charisma has walked 200 minutes after 5 days at the office.**
We are given:

- Brett is **14 years old** now.
- In **four years**, Angela will be **three times as old as Brett is now**.

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the unknown
Let **A** be Angela's current age.

---

### Step 2: Use the information about the future
In **4 years**, Angela's age will be:
$$
A + 4
$$

At that time, she will be **three times as old as Brett is now**. Since Brett is currently 14, three times that is:
$$
3 \times 14 = 42
$$

So we can write the equation:
$$
A + 4 = 42
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for A
$$
A = 42 - 4 = 38
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Angela is 38 years old now.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Number of days:**
Paul drove for **14 days**.

### 2. **Rides per day:**
- He drives **once in the morning**.
- He drives **once in the afternoon**.

So, he makes **2 rides per day**.

### 3. **Cost per ride:**
- Morning ride: **$6**
- Afternoon ride: **$2**

### 4. **Total cost per day:**
$$
\text{Morning cost} + \text{Afternoon cost} = \$6 + \$2 = \$8 \text{ per day}
$$

### 5. **Total cost for 14 days:**
$$
\$8 \times 14 = \$112
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Paul spent $112 on driving his car during these two weeks.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Find how many oranges Ashley brought**

Ashley brought **5 boxes**, and each box has **10 oranges**.

$$
\text{Oranges from Ashley} = 5 \times 10 = 50 \text{ oranges}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find how many oranges Brianne brought**

Brianne brought **20 more oranges** than Ashley.

$$
\text{Oranges from Brianne} = 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ oranges}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the total number of oranges they have together**

$$
\text{Total oranges} = 50 + 70 = 120 \text{ oranges}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Determine how many pies they can make**

Each Greek orange pie requires **3 oranges**.

$$
\text{Number of pies} = \frac{120}{3} = 40
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{40}
$$

They can make **40 Greek orange pies**.
Let's break this down step by step and solve for the number of guests where the **total cost** of both venues is the same.

---

### **Venue 1:**
- **Flat fee:** $200 (regardless of the number of guests)
- **Food cost:** $5 per guest

So, total cost for Venue 1 =  
$$
200 + 5x
$$
where $ x $ is the number of guests.

---

### **Venue 2:**
- **Cost per person:** $25 per guest (includes food)
- So, total cost for Venue 2 =  
$$
25x
$$

---

### **Set the two costs equal to find when they are the same:**

$$
200 + 5x = 25x
$$

Now solve for $ x $:

$$
200 = 25x - 5x \\
200 = 20x \\
x = \frac{200}{20} = 10
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**10 guests** are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.
We are given the following information:

- Together, Lily, David, and Bodhi collected **43 insects**.
- **Lily found 7 more than David.**
- **David found half of what Bodhi found.**

Let’s define variables for each person:

Let:
- $ D $ = number of insects David found
- $ L $ = number of insects Lily found
- $ B $ = number of insects Bodhi found

### Step 1: Use the relationships given.

From the problem:

1. $ L = D + 7 $ (Lily found 7 more than David)
2. $ D = \frac{1}{2}B $ (David found half of what Bodhi found)

### Step 2: Express all in terms of one variable.

From equation (2):  
$ D = \frac{1}{2}B $

Substitute into equation (1):  
$ L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7 $

Now we have expressions for both $ L $ and $ D $ in terms of $ B $.  
We also know that the total is 43:

$$
L + D + B = 43
$$

Substitute $ L $ and $ D $:

$$
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}B\right) + B = 43
$$

### Step 3: Simplify the equation.

$$
\frac{1}{2}B + 7 + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43
$$

Combine like terms:

$$
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + \frac{1}{2}B + B\right) + 7 = 43
$$

$$
(1B + B) + 7 = 43
$$

$$
2B + 7 = 43
$$

### Step 4: Solve for $ B $

$$
2B = 43 - 7 = 36
$$

$$
B = 18
$$

### Step 5: Find David's and Lily's numbers

- $ D = \frac{1}{2}B = \frac{1}{2}(18) = 9 $
- $ L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16 $

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Lily found 16 insects.**
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Find how many yards Mariah used
Mariah used **1/4 of a skein**, and each skein has **364 yards**.

$$
\text{Mariah's yarn} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = 91 \text{ yards}
$$

### Step 2: Find how many yards Grandma used
Grandma used **1/2 of a skein**.

$$
\text{Grandma's yarn} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = 182 \text{ yards}
$$

### Step 3: Add the amounts together
$$
\text{Total yarn used} = 91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**273 yards of yarn** were used altogether.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Gifts for the 2 friends who want 5 gifts each
- Each of these 2 friends wants **5 gifts**.
- So, total gifts for them =  
  $$
  2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ gifts}
  $$

### Step 2: Gifts for the other 3 friends who want 2 gifts each
- Each of these 3 friends wants **2 gifts**.
- So, total gifts for them =  
  $$
  3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ gifts}
  $$

### Step 3: Additional random gifts
- Cherrie buys **10 more random gifts** as a surprise.

### Step 4: Add all the gifts together
$$
10 \text{ (for first 2 friends)} + 6 \text{ (for next 3 friends)} + 10 \text{ (random gifts)} = 26 \text{ gifts}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{26}
$$
We are given the following information:

1. The **rug** is **5 feet wider than the chair**.
2. The **couch** is **2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug**.
3. The **chair is 3 feet wide**.

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find the width of the rug

We are told:
- The **chair** is **3 feet wide**
- The **rug** is **5 feet wider than the chair**

So, the width of the rug is:

$$
\text{Width of rug} = \text{Width of chair} + 5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the rug's width to find the couch's length

We are told:
- The **couch** is **2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug**

So, we calculate:

$$
\text{Length of couch} = 2 \times (\text{Width of rug}) + 2 = 2 \times 8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{18} \text{ feet}
$$

The **couch is 18 feet long**.
We are told that Suzie bought **four packs of gum**, and the total cost was **$7**. We need to find out how much each pack of **strawberry gum** cost.

### Step 1: Identify what we know
- She bought **4 packs** in total.
- She got **2 packs of strawberry gum**.
- She bought **1 pack of grape gum** for **$2**.
- She bought **1 pack of green apple gum**, which cost **half as much as the grape gum**.
- The **total cost** is **$7**.

---

### Step 2: Assign variables

Let’s let:

- $ s $ = cost of one pack of **strawberry gum**
- Grape gum = $2
- Green apple gum = $ \frac{1}{2} \times 2 = 1 $

So, the cost of the four packs is:

$$
2s + 2 + 1 = 7
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve the equation

$$
2s + 2 + 1 = 7 \\
2s + 3 = 7 \\
2s = 7 - 3 \\
2s = 4 \\
s = \frac{4}{2} = 2
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Each pack of **strawberry gum** cost **$2**.
We are given the following information:

- **Frederick wants to make popsicle sticks.**
- **He can get:**
  - **200 sticks from a 2 x 4 piece of wood**
  - **400 sticks from a 2 x 8 piece of wood**
- **He has $24 to spend on wood.**
- **A 2 x 4 costs $4**
- **A 2 x 8 costs $6**

### Step 1: Define variables
Let:
- $ x $ = number of 2 x 4 pieces he buys
- $ y $ = number of 2 x 8 pieces he buys

### Step 2: Cost constraint
The total cost must be ≤ $24:

$$
4x + 6y \leq 24
$$

### Step 3: Total number of sticks
Total sticks = sticks from 2 x 4s + sticks from 2 x 8s:

$$
\text{Total sticks} = 200x + 400y
$$

Our goal is to **maximize** this total, under the cost constraint.

---

### Step 4: Try different combinations that satisfy the cost constraint

We will test integer values of $ x $ and $ y $ such that $ 4x + 6y \leq 24 $, and find the one with the **maximum** total sticks.

#### Option 1: Buy only 2 x 4s

- $ x = 6 $ (since $ 4 \times 6 = 24 $)
- $ y = 0 $
- Sticks = $ 200 \times 6 + 400 \times 0 = 1200 $

#### Option 2: Buy 4 of 2 x 4s and 1 of 2 x 8

- $ x = 4 $, $ y = 1 $
- Cost = $ 4 \times 4 + 6 \times 1 = 16 + 6 = 22 $
- Sticks = $ 200 \times 4 + 400 \times 1 = 800 + 400 = 1200 $

#### Option 3: Buy 3 of 2 x 4s and 2 of 2 x 8s

- $ x = 3 $, $ y = 2 $
- Cost = $ 4 \times 3 + 6 \times 2 = 12 + 12 = 24 $
- Sticks = $ 200 \times 3 + 400 \times 2 = 600 + 800 = 1400 $

#### Option 4: Buy 2 of 2 x 4s and 3 of 2 x 8s

- $ x = 2 $, $ y = 3 $
- Cost = $ 4 \times 2 + 6 \times 3 = 8 + 18 = 26 $ → Too expensive

#### Option 5: Buy 1 of 2 x 4 and 3 of 2 x 8

- $ x = 1 $, $ y = 3 $
- Cost = $ 4 + 18 = 22 $
- Sticks = $ 200 + 1200 = 1400 $

#### Option 6: Buy 0 of 2 x 4 and 4 of 2 x 8

- $ x = 0 $, $ y = 4 $
- Cost = $ 0 + 24 = 24 $
- Sticks = $ 0 + 1600 = 1600 $

---

### Step 5: Evaluate the best option

| x | y | Cost | Sticks |
|---|---|------|--------|
| 6 | 0 | $24 | 1200   |
| 4 | 1 | $22 | 1200   |
| 3 | 2 | $24 | 1400   |
| 1 | 3 | $22 | 1400   |
| 0 | 4 | $24 | **1600** |

✅ **Maximum sticks = 1600**, when buying **4 of 2 x 8s**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The most popsicle sticks Frederick can make is 1600.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of dogs**: Mario has **6 sled dogs**.

2. **Snowshoes per dog**: Each dog needs **2 snowshoes** (one for each leg).

3. **Total number of snowshoes needed**:
   $$
   6 \text{ dogs} \times 2 \text{ snowshoes per dog} = 12 \text{ snowshoes}
   $$

4. **Cost per pair of snowshoes**: Each **pair** of snowshoes costs **$12.00**.

5. **Total cost**:
   $$
   12 \text{ snowshoes} \div 2 \text{ snowshoes per pair} = 6 \text{ pairs}
   $$
   $$
   6 \text{ pairs} \times \$12.00 \text{ per pair} = \$72.00
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **\$72.00**
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Calculate the cost of bus trips per week:**
- Janet takes **2 bus trips per day**.
- She does this **5 days a week**.
- Each trip costs **$2.20**.

So, total weekly cost without a pass:
$$
2 \text{ trips/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} \times \$2.20/\text{trip}
$$
$$
= 10 \text{ trips/week} \times \$2.20 = \$22.00
$$

### 2. **Cost with a weekly bus pass:**
- A weekly bus pass costs **\$20**.

### 3. **Calculate the savings:**
$$
\text{Savings} = \text{Cost without pass} - \text{Cost with pass}
$$
$$
= \$22.00 - \$20.00 = \$2.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Janet would save \$2.00 per week by buying a weekly bus pass.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information

- **Farm has 30 cows.**
- **Zoo has 20 sheep.**
- **Zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.**
- **Farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.**

We are asked to find the **total number of animals** (cows and sheep) on the **farm and the zoo combined**.

---

### Step 2: Use the clues to find missing numbers

#### Clue 1: Zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does.
- Farm has 30 cows.
- So, Zoo has:  
  $$
  2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cows}
  $$

#### Clue 2: Farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.
- Let’s call the number of sheep in the **zoo** = $ x $
- Then the number of sheep in the **farm** is:
  $$
  \frac{x}{2}
  $$
- We are told that the **farm has 20 sheep**, so:
  $$
  \frac{x}{2} = 20
  $$
  Multiply both sides by 2:
  $$
  x = 40
  $$
- So, the **zoo has 40 sheep**.

---

### Step 3: Add up all the animals

- **Farm:**
  - Cows: 30
  - Sheep: 20
  - Total: $ 30 + 20 = 50 $

- **Zoo:**
  - Cows: 60
  - Sheep: 40
  - Total: $ 60 + 40 = 100 $

- **Combined total:**
  $$
  50 + 100 = \boxed{150}
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{150}
$$ animals in total.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the relationship
- Rose bought **4 times** the number of **onions and potatoes** that Sophia bought.
- That means if Sophia bought **x** onions and **y** potatoes, then Rose bought:
  $$
  4x \text{ onions and } 4y \text{ potatoes}
  $$

### Step 2: Use the given information
We are told:
- Rose bought **12 onions** and **4 potatoes**

So:
$$
4x = 12 \quad \text{(for onions)} \\
4y = 4 \quad \text{(for potatoes)}
$$

### Step 3: Solve for x and y
From the first equation:
$$
4x = 12 \Rightarrow x = \frac{12}{4} = 3
$$

From the second equation:
$$
4y = 4 \Rightarrow y = \frac{4}{4} = 1
$$

### Step 4: Find the total number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought
Sophia bought:
- $ x = 3 $ onions
- $ y = 1 $ potato

So the **total** number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought is:
$$
3 + 1 = \boxed{4}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **4** (3 onions and 1 potato)
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much of a **calorie deficit** Andy needs each day to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is **July 19th**, and today is **December 31st**.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the number of days between December 31st and July 19th**

We need to count how many days are left between **December 31st** (today) and **July 19th**.

- From **December 31st to January 1st**: 1 day
- January: 31 days
- February: 28 days (not a leap year)
- March: 31 days
- April: 30 days
- May: 31 days
- June: 30 days
- July 1–19: 19 days

Now add them up:

$$
1 + 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 = 181 \text{ days}
$$

So, Andy has **181 days** to lose 30 lbs.

---

### **Step 2: Calories needed to lose 1 pound**

You said:
> "Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound."

That means, to lose **1 lb**, he needs a **calorie deficit of 3500 calories**.

---

### **Step 3: Total calorie deficit needed for 30 lbs**

To lose 30 lbs, he needs a total calorie deficit of:

$$
30 \times 3500 = 105,000 \text{ calories}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Daily calorie deficit required**

Now divide the total calorie deficit by the number of days:

$$
\frac{105,000}{181} \approx 580 \text{ calories per day}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Andy needs a **daily calorie deficit of approximately 580 calories** to lose 30 lbs by July 19th.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Gerald earns $30 per day.**  
   He worked for **7 days** in a week, so his total earnings are:  
   $$
   30 \times 7 = 210
   $$

2. **He spent $100** during the week.

3. **To find out how much he has left**, subtract his total spending from his total earnings:  
   $$
   210 - 100 = 110
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: Gerald has **$110 left**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Determine the total distance Hannah runs:**

   - Each lap is **0.25 km**.

  0.20 \times 500 = 100
  $$

- So, she spends **$100** on clothes.

- Remaining money after buying clothes:
  $$
  500 - 100 = 400
  $$

---

### Step 3: She then spends **25%** of the remaining money on CDs.

- The remaining money is **$400**.
- 25% of $400 is:
  $$
  0.25 \times 400 = 100
  $$

- So, she spends **$100** on CDs.

- Remaining money after buying CDs:
  $$
  400 - 100 = 300
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Julie has **$300** left.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ H $ = cost of the house  
- $ L $ = cost of the lot  

We are told:

1. The total cost of the house and the lot is **$120,000**  
   So,  
   $$
   H + L = 120,000
   $$

2. The house costs **three times as much as the lot**  
   So,  
   $$
   H = 3L
   $$

---

### Step 2: Substitute into the first equation

Substitute $ H = 3L $ into $ H + L = 120,000 $:

$$
3L + L = 120,000
$$

$$
4L = 120,000
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ L $

$$
L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000
$$

So, the lot costs **$30,000**.

---

### Step 4: Find the cost of the house

$$
H = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**The house cost $90,000.**
Let's break this down step by step to find Tara's **profit**.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total number of canvas bags**
Tara bought **8 packs**, and each pack contains **5 canvas bags**:

$$
8 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ bags per pack} = 40 \text{ bags}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the total cost**
Each bag cost **$4**, so the total cost is:

$$
40 \text{ bags} \times \$4 \text{ per bag} = \$160
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total revenue**
Tara sold each bag for **$8**, so the total revenue is:

$$
40 \text{ bags} \times \$8 \text{ per bag} = \$320
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the profit**
Profit = Revenue - Cost

$$
\$320 - \$160 = \$160
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Tara earned a profit of \$160.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Punches per minute**: Joe throws **25 punches per minute**.

2. **Fight duration**:
   - Each round is **3 minutes**.
   - There are **5 rounds**.
   - So, total fight time = $ 5 \text{ rounds} \times 3 \text{ minutes per round} = 15 \text{ minutes} $.

3. **Total punches thrown**:
   - In 1 minute: 25 punches
   - In 15 minutes: $ 25 \text{ punches/minute} \times 15 \text{ minutes} = 375 \text{ punches} $

### ✅ Final Answer: **375 punches**

$$
\boxed{18}
$$

Kelsie made **18 cookies**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Ali has**

Ali has:
- 4 bills of $10 → $ 4 × 10 = **$40**
- 6 bills of $20 → $ 6 × 20 = **$120**

**Total money Ali has:**
$$
40 + 120 = \boxed{160} \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Ali gives half of the total money to his sister**

He gives away:
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 160 = \boxed{80} \text{ dollars}
$$

So, the remaining amount is:
$$
160 - 80 = \boxed{80} \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 3: He uses 3/5 of the remaining money to buy dinner**

He uses:
$$
\frac{3}{5} \times 80 = \frac{3 \times 80}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = \boxed{48} \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate how much money he has left after buying dinner**

Remaining money after giving to sister: $80  
Money used for dinner: $48

So, final amount:
$$
80 - 48 = \boxed{32} \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $\boxed{32}$ dollars**
We are told:

- **Rob takes 2 hours** to shingle a house.
- **Royce takes 40 minutes more than double Rob's time.**

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Convert Rob’s time to minutes

Rob takes **2 hours**, and since there are **60 minutes in an hour**:

$$
2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 2: Double Rob’s time

$$
2 \times 120 = 240 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add 40 minutes

Royce takes **40 minutes more than double Rob’s time**, so:

$$
240 + 40 = 280 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{280} \text{ minutes}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many skeins of wool Martha will need.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the number of items per grandchild**

Martha is making:
- 1 hat  
- 1 scarf  
- 1 sweater  
- 1 pair of mittens  
- 1 pair of socks  

So, for **each grandchild**, she needs:
- 1 hat  
- 1 scarf  
- 1 sweater  
- 1 pair of mittens  
- 1 pair of socks  

That’s **5 items** per grandchild.

---

### **Step 2: Find the number of skeins needed per item**

From the problem:
- 1 hat = **2 skeins**
- 1 scarf = **4 skeins**
- 1 sweater = **12 skeins**
- 1 pair of mittens = **1 skein**
- 1 pair of socks = **2 skeins**

Now, add up the total skeins needed for **one child**:

$$
2 \text{ (hat)} + 4 \text{ (scarf)} + 12 \text{ (sweater)} + 1 \text{ (mittens)} + 2 \text{ (socks)} = 21 \text{ skeins}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Multiply by the number of grandchildren**

There are **3 grandchildren**, so:

$$
21 \text{ skeins/child} \times 3 \text{ children} = 63 \text{ skeins}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

**Martha will need 63 skeins of wool.**
Let's solve this step by step:

### Total math problems:  
**100**

---

### Step 1: Problems completed on Monday  
Chris completes **12** problems on Monday.

Remaining after Monday:  
**100 - 12 = 88** problems left

---

### Step 2: Problems completed on Tuesday  
He completes **3 times as many** as he did on Monday.  
So, on Tuesday:  
**3 × 12 = 36** problems

Remaining after Tuesday:  
**88 - 36 = 52** problems left

---

### Step 3: Problems completed on Wednesday  
He completes **one-quarter of the remaining** problems.  
One-quarter of 52 is:  
**52 ÷ 4 = 13** problems

Remaining after Wednesday:

Let's solve this step by step.

We are given the picking rates of four people: **Tony, Bobby, Kathy, and Ricky**. We need to find the total number of quarts they can pick **per hour** together.

---

### Step 1: Tony's rate

> Tony can pick **6 quarts per hour**.

So,  
$$
\text{Tony} = 6 \text{ quarts/hour}
$$

---

### Step 2: Bobby's rate

> Bobby picks **one less quart per hour than Tony**.

So,  
$$
\text{Bobby} = 6 - 1 = 5 \text{ quarts/hour}
$$

---

### Step 3: Kathy's rate

> Kathy can pick **twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby**.

So,  
$$
\text{Kathy} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ quarts/hour}
$$

---

### Step 4: Ricky's rate

> Ricky picks **two fewer quarts per hour than Kathy**.

So,  
$$
\text{Ricky} = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ quarts/hour}
$$

---

### Step 5: Total picking rate

Now we add up all their rates:

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Tony} + \text{Bobby} + \text{Kathy} + \text{Ricky}
$$
$$
= 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 \text{ quarts/hour}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{29} \text{ quarts per hour}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Start with the total number of loaves baked:**  
   $ 200 $ loaves

2. **Subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning:**  
   $ 200 - 93 = 107 $ loaves left after morning sales

3. **Subtract the number of loaves sold in the afternoon:**  
   $ 107 - 39 = 68 $ loaves left after afternoon sales

4. **Add back the unsold loaves returned by the grocery store:**  
   $ 68 + 6 = 74 $ loaves

### ✅ Final Answer: **74 loaves** of bread were left.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the planting capacity
- Jackson can plant **6 red tulips per row**.
- He can plant **8 blue tulips per row**.

### Step 2: Determine how many rows are needed for each color

#### For red tulips:
- Total red tulips = 36
- Tulips per row = 6  
So, number of rows needed for red tulips =  
$$
\frac{36}{6} = 6 \text{ rows}
$$

#### For blue tulips:
- Total blue tulips = 24
- Tulips per row = 8  
So, number of rows needed for blue tulips =  
$$
\frac{24}{8} = 3 \text{ rows}
$$

### Step 3: Add the rows together
Jackson will plant:
- 6 rows of red tulips
- 3 rows of blue tulips

So, total rows =  
$$
6 + 3 = 9 \text{ rows}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**9 rows** of flowers.
We are told that Heather has **27 cups of raisins** and wants to make **oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix**, dividing the raisins **equally among the three**.

---

### Step 1: Divide the raisins equally among the three items

Since she is dividing the raisins equally among **3 items** (cookies, granola, and snack mix), we divide the total amount of raisins by 3:

$$
\frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups}
$$

So, each item gets **9 cups of raisins**.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies can be made from 9 cups

Each batch of **oatmeal cookies** requires **3/4 of a cup** of raisins.

To find how many batches can be made from 9 cups, we divide:

$$
9 \div \frac{3}{4} = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{36}{3} = 12
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Heather can make 12 batches of oatmeal cookies.**
Let's break this down step by step to find the **difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after** she adds the new device.

---

### **Step 1: Determine daily consumption before adding the device**

Ada's current daily consumption is:

$$
12 \text{ kilowatt-hours (kWh)}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate daily cost before adding the device**

Electricity costs **$1.50 per kWh**, so her daily cost is:

$$
12 \times 1.50 = 18 \text{ dollars per day}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine daily consumption after adding the device**

She adds a device that consumes:

$$
2 \text{ kWh per day}
$$

So, her new daily consumption is:

$$
12 + 2 = 14 \text{ kWh per day}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate daily cost after adding the device**

$$
14 \times 1.50 = 21 \text{ dollars per day}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Find the difference in daily cost**

$$
21 - 18 = 3 \text{ dollars per day}
$$

---

### **Step 6: Find the difference in weekly cost**

There are 7 days in a week, so the weekly difference is:

$$
3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\$21}
$$

The **difference between Ada's weekly electric bill before and after** she adds the new device is **\$21**.
We are given:

- **One person can paint half a house in 5 days.**

We want to find:  
**How many hours would it take for 5 people to paint a whole house?**

---

### Step 1: Find the rate of one person

If one person paints **half a house in 5 days**, then that person paints:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \text{ house in } 5 \text{ days}
$$

So, in one day, this person paints:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \div 5 = \frac{1}{10} \text{ house per day}
$$

That means **one person paints at a rate of $ \frac{1}{10} $ house per day**.

---

### Step 2: Find the rate of 5 people

If one person paints $ \frac{1}{10} $ house per day, then 5 people together paint:

$$
5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ house per day}
$$

So, **5 people paint half a house in one day**.

---

### Step 3: How long to paint a full house?

Since 5 people paint **half a house in 1 day**, they will paint a **whole house in 2 days**.

---

### Step 4: Convert days to hours

Assuming a standard workday is **8 hours**, then:

$$
2 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 16 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{16 \text{ hours}}
$$
We are given the following information:

1. **Ophelia has 20 sofas.**
2. **Each of them (Ophelia and Jenna) has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.**
3. **Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.**

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ C_O $ = number of **chairs** that Ophelia has
- $ S_O $ = number of **sofas** that Ophelia has = **20** (given)
- $ C_J $ = number of **chairs** that Jenna has
- $ S_J $ = number of **sofas** that Jenna has

From the problem:

> Each has 2 fewer sofas than chairs.

So for both Ophelia and Jenna:

$$
S = C - 2
$$

So for Ophelia:

$$
S_O = C_O - 2 \Rightarrow 20 = C_O - 2 \Rightarrow C_O = 22
$$

So, **Ophelia has 22 chairs**.

---

### Step 2: Use the relation between Jenna's chairs and Ophelia's chairs

> Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia.

$$
C_J = 3 \times C_O = 3 \times 22 = 66
$$

So, **Jenna has 66 chairs**.

Now use the same "2 fewer sofas than chairs" rule for Jenna:

$$
S_J = C_J - 2 = 66 - 2 = 64
$$

So, **Jenna has 64 sofas**.

---

### Step 3: Total number of sofas and chairs

Total sofas:

$$
S_O + S_J = 20 + 64 = 84
$$

Total chairs:

$$
C_O + C_J = 22 + 66 = 88
$$

---

### Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{84 \text{ sofas and } 88 \text{ chairs}}
$$

So, the **total number of sofas and chairs** is:

$$
\boxed{84 + 88 = 172}
$$

✅ **Answer: 172**
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand what is given

- Tom bought a **CD** for **$4**
- He also bought a **headphone set**
- In total, he paid **$48**

We are asked:

> **How many more CDs would Tom have been able to buy if he had decided not to buy the headphone set?**

---

### Step 2: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ x $ = cost of the headphone set

From the information:
$$
\text{Cost of CD} + \text{Cost of headphone set} = \text{Total amount spent}
$$
$$
4 + x = 48
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = 48 - 4 = 44
$$

So, the headphone set cost **$44**

---

### Step 4: How many CDs could he have bought instead?

If he had **not** bought the headphone set, he would have saved **$44**, and that money could be used to buy more CDs.

Each CD costs **$4**, so:

$$
\frac{44}{4} = 11
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Tom would have been able to buy 11 more CDs if he had decided not to buy the headphone set.**
We are told that Josh tracked his workout routine for **8 weeks**, and in **most** of those weeks, he worked out for **4 hours per week**. However, there were **some exceptions**:

- He spent **5 hours each for two consecutive weeks**.
- He spent **6 hours in one week**.

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many weeks he worked out for 4 hours

Total number of weeks = **8**

He worked out for **5 hours** for **2 consecutive weeks**, and **6 hours** for **1 week**.

So the number of weeks where he worked out for **4 hours** is:

$$
8 - 2 - 1 = 5 \text{ weeks}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate total workout hours

- For the **5 weeks** at **4 hours**:  
  $$
  5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ hours}
  $$

- For the **2 weeks** at **5 hours**:  
  $$
  2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ hours}
  $$

- For the **1 week** at **6 hours**:  
  $$
  1 \times 6 = 6 \text{ hours}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Add them all up

$$
20 + 10 + 6 = \boxed{36} \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{36} \text{ hours}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Initial number of passengers:**
- 48 people are on the bus.

---

### **First stop:**

- **8 passengers get off.**
  - Remaining passengers = $ 48 - 8 = 40 $
  
- **5 times as many people as those who got off get on.**
  - Number of people getting on = $ 5 \times 8 = 40 $
  - New total passengers = $ 40 + 40 = 80 $

---

### **Second stop:**

- **21 passengers get off.**
  - Remaining passengers = $ 80 - 21 = 59 $
  
- **3 times fewer passengers get on.**
  - "3 times fewer" means the number of people getting on is $ \frac{1}{3} $ of the number who got off.
  - So, number of people getting on = $ \frac{21}{3} = 7 $
  - New total passengers = $ 59 + 7 = 66 $

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**66 passengers are riding the bus after the second stop.**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine Jame's current age

We are told:

> "Jame will turn 27 in 5 years."

So, **in 5 years**, Jame will be 27 years old.

That means his **current age** is:

$$
27 - 5 = 22 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### Step 2: Let’s define the cousin’s current age

Let’s call the **cousin’s current age** $ x $.

Now, we’re told:

> "In 8 years his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age."

Let’s break that down:

- In 8 years, Jame’s age will be:
  $$
  22 + 8 = 30
  $$

- Twice Jame’s age in 8 years:
  $$
  2 \times 30 = 60
  $$

- The cousin will be **5 years younger** than that:
  $$
  60 - 5 = 55
  $$

So, in 8 years, the cousin will be **55 years old**.

Therefore, the **cousin’s current age** is:
$$
55 - 8 = 47
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the age difference between them now

- Jame is currently **22**
- Cousin is currently **47**

The **age difference** is:
$$
47 - 22 = 25
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{25}
$$

There is a **25-year difference** between their ages.
We are given the following information:

- Errol bought a **computer**, **2 monitors**, and a **printer** for **$2,400**.
- The **printer cost $400 less than the computer**.
- The **computer cost $1,100**.

We are asked to find the **cost of one monitor**.

---

### Step 1: Find the cost of the printer

The printer costs **$400 less than the computer**.

$$
\text{Printer cost} = \text{Computer cost} - 400 = 1100 - 400 = 700
$$

So, the **printer cost is $700**.

---

### Step 2: Add up the known costs

So far, we know:

- Computer: $1,100  
- Printer: $700  
- Total of these two items:  
$$
1100 + 700 = 1800
$$

---

### Step 3: Subtract from total to find cost of 2 monitors

Total amount spent: $2,400  
Cost of computer and printer: $1,800  
So, cost of **2 monitors** is:

$$
2400 - 1800 = 600
$$

---

### Step 4: Find cost of **one monitor**

$$
\text{Cost of one monitor} = \frac{600}{2} = 300
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{300}
$$

One monitor costs **$300**.
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the setup**

- There are **20 kids** on the trip.
- They are divided into **two equal groups of girls and boys**.
- That means:
  - Number of **girls** = 10
  - Number of **boys** = 10

---

### **Step 2: Information about shells brought by boys**

- Each **boy** brought back **60 seashells**.
- So, total shells brought by **all boys** =  
  $$
  10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ shells/boy} = 600 \text{ shells}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Information about shells brought by girls**

- The girls brought an amount **equal to** the number of shells brought by the boys **plus four times as many seashells as the boys**.
- That is:

$$
\text{Shells brought by girls} = \text{Shells brought by boys} + 4 \times (\text{Shells brought by boys})
$$

$$
= 600 + 4 \times 600 = 600 + 2400 = 3000 \text{ shells}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Find how many shells each girl brought**

- There are **10 girls**, and they brought a total of **3000 shells**.
- So, each girl brought:

$$
\frac{3000}{10} = 300 \text{ shells}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{300}
$$

Each girl brought **300 seashells**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s let:
- $ G $ = the number of candies George originally had
- $ N $ = the number of candies Nick had

We are told:

> **Nick had twice as many candies as George.**

So we can write:
$$
N = 2G \tag{1}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the information about George eating candies

> **George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left.**

So, George originally had:
$$
G = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ candies}
$$

---

### Step 3: Plug into equation (1) to find Nick's candies

Now that we know $ G = 8 $, plug it into equation (1):

$$
N = 2G = 2 \times 8 = 16
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{16}
$$

Nick has **16 candies**.
Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. **Chenny's age**:  
   Chenny is 10 years old.

2. **Alyana's age**:  
   Alyana is 4 years younger than Chenny.  
   So, Alyana's age = Chenny's age - 4  
   = 10 - 4 = **6 years old**

3. **Anne's age**:  
   Anne is 2 years older than Alyana.  
   So, Anne's age = Alyana's age + 2  
   = 6 + 2 = **8 years old**

### ✅ Final Answer: **Anne is 8 years old.**
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Thickness of each book

- **First book:** 31 mm

Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Total vlogs Emma needs to make in a month
Emma can make **72 vlogs per month**.

### Step 2: Vlogs made in the first three weeks
- First week: **18 vlogs**
- Second week: **21 vlogs**
- Third week: **15 vlogs**

Add these up:
$$
18 + 21 + 15 = 54 \text{ vlogs}
$$

### Step 3: Vlogs remaining to reach 72
Subtract the number of vlogs already made from the total goal:
$$
72 - 54 = 18 \text{ vlogs}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Emma should make **18 more vlogs** to complete the 72 vlogs for the month.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **The total dinner bill is $50.**

2. **Your wife wants to evenly split the check**, so normally, each of you would pay:
   $$
   \frac{50}{2} = 25
   $$
   So, normally, you'd pay $25.

3. **But your wife wants you to pay an additional 20% tip on the entire $50 bill.**
   - First, calculate the 20% tip:
     $$
     0.20 \times 50 = 10
     $$

4. **So, instead of splitting the $50 evenly, you end up paying the full $50 plus the $10 tip:**
   $$
   50 + 10 = 60
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**You ended up paying $60.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### **Step 1: Initial Sharing**

- $18 is shared among **3 boys**.
- So, each boy gets:

$$
\frac{18}{3} = 6
$$

So, the **eldest boy initially has $6**.

---

### **Step 2: Eldest Adds $5 to His Share**

- He adds $5 to his initial $6:

$$
6 + 5 = 11
$$

Now he has **$11**.

---

### **Step 3: Adds Another $10 the Following Day**

- He adds another $10:

$$
11 + 10 = 21
$$

Now he has **$21**.

---

### **Step 4: Spends $8 from His Total So Far**

- He spends $8:

$$
21 - 8 = 13
$$

Now he has **$13** left.

---

### **Step 5: After Saving Some More, He Triples the Amount He Had Left After Spending $8**

- He had **$13** after spending $8.
- He **triples** that amount:

$$
13 \times 3 = 39
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{39}
$$

He now has **$39**.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the total monthly savings target
Elvis wants to save **$1125** in April.

### Step 2: Determine how many days are in the first and second halves of April
April has **30 days**, so:

- First half = 15 days  
- Second half = 15 days

### Step 3: Let’s define variables
Let:
- $ x $ = amount Elvis saves per day in the **first half**
- Then, he saves **twice as much per day** in the **second half**, so that is $ 2x $

### Step 4: Write an equation for total savings
He saves $ x $ per day for 15 days in the first half, and $ 2x $ per day for 15 days in the second half.

So total savings:

$$
15x + 15(2x) = 1125
$$

Simplify:

$$
15x + 30x = 1125 \\
45x = 1125
$$

### Step 5: Solve for $ x $
$$
x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
$$

So Elvis saves **$25 per day** in the first half.

### Step 6: Find how much he saves per day in the second half
Since he saves twice as much in the second half:

$$
2x = 2 \times 25 = \boxed{50}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Elvis has to save $50 per day in the second half of April.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much change Verna received.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of each type of fruit

- **Apples**:  
  She bought 3 apples at $1.50 each:  
  $$
  3 \times 1.50 = 4.50
  $$

- **Oranges**:  
  She bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each:  
  $$
  5 \times 0.80 = 4.00
  $$

- **Peaches**:  
  She bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each:  
  $$
  6 \times 0.75 = 4.50
  $$

---

### Step 2: Add up the total cost

$$
4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00
$$

So, the total cost of all the fruit is **$13.00**.

---

### Step 3: Subtract the total cost from the amount paid

She gave $20:

$$
20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Verna received **$7.00** in change.

$$

### Step 2: Determine how much Jenny earns
- Jenny gets **$0.5** per task.
- She also finishes **20 tasks**.

$$
\text{Jenny's earnings} = 0.5 \times 20 = 10 \text{ dollars}
$$

### Step 3: Find the difference in their earnings
$$
\text{Difference} = 16 - 10 = 6 \text{ dollars}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jairus will get $6 more than Jenny.**
We are told that Jeff and Brad are dividing $100, and **Jeff gets 4 times as much as Brad**.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s let:
- $ x $ = the amount Brad gets
- Then Jeff gets $ 4x $

---

### Step 2: Set up the equation

The total amount they get is $100:

$$
x + 4x = 100
$$

$$
5x = 100
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = \frac{100}{5} = 20
$$

So, Brad gets $20.

---

### Step 4: Find how much Jeff gets

$$
\text{Jeff's share} = 4x = 4 \times 20 = 80
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jeff gets $80.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Distance one way:** Jeff's work is **3 miles** away.
2. **Round trip (there and back):**  
   - To work, he walks **3 miles** to get there.  
   - Then he walks **3 miles** back home.  
   - So, for one day of work, he walks:  
     $ 3 + 3 = 6 $ miles.

3. **Number of workdays per week:** He works **5 days a week**.

4. **Total miles walked in a week:**  
   - Multiply the daily round-trip distance by the number of workdays:  
     $ 6 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ miles} $

### ✅ Final Answer: **30 miles**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand what the alphabet contains

The English alphabet has **26 letters**.

---

### Step 2: First writing — full alphabet

Elise writes the entire alphabet once:

- Letters written: **26**

---

### Step 3: Second writing — half of the alphabet

She writes **half** of the alphabet. Since the full alphabet is 26 letters, half would be:

- Half of 26 = **13 letters**

So she writes **13 letters**.

---

### Step 4: Third writing — re-writing everything she has already written

Now, she re-writes **everything she has already written**. That means she rewrites the **first two parts**:

- First part: 26 letters  
- Second part: 13 letters  
- Total written so far: 26 + 13 = **39 letters**

So she now writes **another 39 letters**.

---

### Step 5: Total letters written

Add up all the letters written in each step:

- First time: 26  
- Second time: 13  
- Third time: 39  

Total = 26 + 13 + 39 = **78**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Elise has written a total of 78 letters.**
We are given a **phone tree** structure where:

- **Ali** calls **3 families** in the **first round**.
- Each of those 3 families then calls **3 more families** in the **second round**.
- This pattern continues, with each family calling **3 new families** in each subsequent round.

We are asked:  
**How many families will be notified during the fourth round of calls?**

---

### Step-by-step Breakdown:

Let’s define:
- **Round 1**: Ali calls 3 families.
- **Round 2**: Each of those 3 families calls 3 new families → $3 \times 3 = 9$ families.
- **Round 3**: Each of the 9 families from Round 2 calls 3 new families → $9 \times 3 = 27$ families.
- **Round 4**: Each of the 27 families from Round 3 calls 3 new families → $27 \times 3 = 81$ families.

So, the number of families notified in each round is:

- Round 1: $3$
- Round 2: $9$
- Round 3: $27$
- Round 4: $81$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{81}
$$

**81 families will be notified during the fourth round of calls.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the information
- Mark was unwell for **3 months**.
- He **lost 10 pounds per month**.
- His **final weight** was **70 pounds**.
- We are asked to find his **initial weight**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate total weight loss
He lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months:

$$
\text{Total weight loss} = 10 \, \text{pounds/month} \times 3 \, \text{months} = 30 \, \text{pounds}
$$

---

### Step 3: Use the final weight to find initial weight
If he lost 30 pounds and ended up at 70 pounds, then his **initial weight** must have been:

$$
\text{Initial weight} = \text{Final weight} + \text{Total weight loss}
$$
$$
\text{Initial weight} = 70 + 30 = 100
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.**
We are given the following information:

- James's play set has **80 toys**.
- Jonathan needs **2 more toys than he already has** to make his play set **five times larger** than James's.
- We need to find how many toys **Jonathan currently has**.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ x $ = number of toys Jonathan currently has

---

### Step 2: Understand what "five times larger" means

James's play set has **80 toys**, so five times that is:

$$
5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
$$

So, Jonathan needs **400 toys** in total to have a play set that is five times larger than James's.

---

### Step 3: Set up the equation

Jonathan currently has $ x $ toys. He needs **2 more toys** than he already has to reach the required 400 toys.

So:

$$
x + 2 = 400
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = 400 - 2 = 398
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{398}
$$

Jonathan currently has **398 toys**.

$$
\$7.50 + \$0.50 + \$12.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00
$$

---

### **Step 4: Apply the 10% discount**

A 10% discount means Daniel pays **90%** of the total cost.

$$
\$30.00 \times 0.90 = \$27.00
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

**Daniel has to spend $27.00** on all the items he wants to buy.

Let's break down the calculation step by step to find out how much **Antonella earned** based on her sales of **$2500**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the commission structure

- **Base commission**: 30% on the first **$1000** of sales.
- **Additional commission**: 10% on any sales **over $1000**.

So, for **$2500**, we need to:
1. Calculate the commission on the first **$1000**.
2. Calculate the commission on the remaining **$1500** (since $2500 - $1000 = $1500).
3. Add both amounts together.

---

### Step 2: Calculate base commission on $1000

$$
\text{Base commission} = 1000 \times 0.30 = 300
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate additional commission on $1500

$$
\text{Additional commission} = 1500 \times 0.10 = 150
$$

---

### Step 4: Total earnings

$$
\text{Total earnings} = 300 + 150 = 450
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Antonella earned $450.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the number of bottles Bill already has**

Bill has **2 cases** of water, and each case contains **24 bottles**.

$$
2 \text{ cases} \times 24 \text{ bottles per case} = 48 \text{ bottles}
$$

So, Bill currently has **48 bottles**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the total number of bottles needed**

He has **70 guests**, and he wants to provide **2 bottles per guest**.

$$
70 \text{ guests} \times 2 \text{ bottles per guest} = 140 \text{ bottles}
$$

So, he needs a total of **140 bottles**.

---

### **Step 3: Subtract the bottles he already has from the total needed**

$$
140 \text{ total needed} - 48 \text{ bottles he already has} = 92 \text{ additional bottles}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Bill will need to buy **92 additional bottles** of water.
We are given:

- On a **cold day**, Ray swims **1 mile in 16 minutes**.
- On a **warm day**, Ray swims **1 mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long** as on a cold day.

We are asked:  
**How much longer does Ray take to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day?**

---

### Step 1: Find the time for 1 mile on a warm day

On a **cold day**, time per mile = **16 minutes**

So, on a **warm day**, time per mile is:

$$
\text{Warm day time per mile} = 2 \times 16 + 2 = 32 + 2 = 34 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find total time for 3 miles on each day

- **Cold day**:  
  $$
  3 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes/mile} = 48 \text{ minutes}
  $$

- **Warm day**:  
  $$
  3 \text{ miles} \times 34 \text{ minutes/mile} = 102 \text{ minutes}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Find the difference in time

$$
102 \text{ minutes (warm)} - 48 \text{ minutes (cold)} = 54 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{54} \text{ minutes}
$$

Ray takes **54 minutes longer** to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.

Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of buttons
The bag has **21 buttons** in total.

### Step 2: Buttons with two holes
We are told that **7 buttons** had **two holes** each.

So, the number of holes from these buttons is:
$$
7 \text{ buttons} \times 2 \text{ holes/button} = 14 \text{ holes}
$$

### Step 3: Remaining buttons
Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 have 2 holes, the rest must have 4 holes.  
Number of remaining buttons:
$$
21 - 7 = 14 \text{ buttons}
$$

Each of these 14 buttons has **4 holes**, so:
$$
14 \text{ buttons} \times 4 \text{ holes/button} = 56 \text{ holes}
$$

### Step 4: Total number of holes
Now add the holes from both groups:
$$
14 \text{ holes (from 2-hole buttons)} + 56 \text{ holes (from 4-hole buttons)} = 70 \text{ holes}

Juan drinks **10 times** the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks:

$$
\text{Juan's coffee intake} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine how much Juan needs to reduce his intake

Juan’s doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the **daily recommendation of 4 cups**.

So, the amount he needs to reduce is:

$$
\text{Reduction needed} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{16} \text{ cups}

Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Mark's weight**:  
   Mark weighs **150 pounds**.

2. **Susan's weight**:  
   Susan weighs **20 pounds less than Mark**, so:  
   $$
   150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
   $$

3. **Bob's weight**:  
   Bob weighs **twice as much as Susan**, so:  
   $$
   2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   $$

4. **Total weight of all three friends**:  
   $$
   150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
   $$

5. **Average weight**:  
   To find the average, divide the total weight by the number of people (3):  
   $$
   \frac{540}{3} = 180 \text{ pounds}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **180 pounds**
Let's break this down step by step.

### **Given:**

- The **pyramid** is at an angle of **32 degrees from the ground** (i.e., it makes a 32° angle with the horizontal).
- The **sun is moving upward** at a rate of **5 degrees per hour**, **relative to the pyramid**.
- The sun starts at the **tip of the pyramid**.
- It moves for **10 hours**.

We are asked:  
> **How many degrees will there be from the ground to the sun after 10 hours?**

---

### **Step 1: Understand the initial angle of the sun relative to the ground**

The pyramid is at an angle of **32 degrees from the ground**, which means its tip is **32 degrees above the horizontal**.

If the **sun starts at the tip of the pyramid**, then initially, the **sun is also at 32 degrees above the ground**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine how much the sun moves upward in 10 hours**

The sun moves upward at **5 degrees per hour**, so in 10 hours:

$$
\text{Sun's movement} = 5^\circ/\text{hour} \times 10\ \text{hours} = 50^\circ
$$

So the **sun moves upward by 50 degrees** from its starting position.

---

### **Step 3: Add the movement to the initial angle**

Since the sun was already at **32 degrees above the ground**, and it moves **50 degrees higher**, the **total angle from the ground to the sun** becomes:

$$
32^\circ + 50^\circ = 82^\circ
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{82^\circ}
$$

So, after 10 hours, the **angle from the ground to the sun** will be **82 degrees**.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the ages of the two sons
- One son is **12 years old**.
- The other is **4 years younger**, so:

$$
12 - 4 = 8 \text{ years old}
$$

So, the two sons are **12 and 8 years old**.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many candles James needs
Assuming James buys **one candle per year of age** for each son:

- For the 12-year-old: **12 candles**
- For the 8-year-old: **8 candles**

Total number of candles needed:

$$
12 + 8 = 20 \text{ candles}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the cost
A pack of **5 candles costs $3**.

So, the cost per candle is:

$$
\frac{3}{5} = 0.60 \text{ dollars per candle}
$$

Now calculate the total cost for 20 candles:

$$
20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{12}
$$

James spends **$12** on candles.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of sandwiches
Cody and Trevor had **12 sandwiches** in total.

---

### Step 2: How many sandwiches Cody ate
Cody ate **a third** of the sandwiches:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
$$

So, Cody ate **4 sandwiches**.

---

### Step 3: How many sandwiches Trevor ate
Trevor ate **a quarter** of the sandwiches:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3
$$

So, Trevor ate **3 sandwiches**.

---

### Step 4: Total number of sandwiches eaten
$$
4 + 3 = 7
$$

So, Cody and Trevor together ate **7 sandwiches**.

---

### Step 5: Number of sandwiches left

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**5 sandwiches are left.**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Define the variables
Let:
- **Shiloh's current age** = 44 years (given)
- **Nephew's current age** = $ x $ years (this is what we need to find)

### Step 2: Use the information given
In **7 years**, Shiloh will be:
$$
44 + 7 = 51 \text{ years old}
$$

At that time, he will be **three times as old as his nephew**. So in 7 years, the nephew will be:
$$
x + 7 \text{ years old}
$$

According to the problem:
$$
\text{Shiloh's age in 7 years} = 3 \times (\text{Nephew's age in 7 years})
$$
$$
51 = 3(x + 7)
$$

### Step 3: Solve the equation
$$
51 = 3(x + 7)
$$
Divide both sides by 3:
$$
17 = x + 7
$$
Subtract 7 from both sides:
$$
x = 10
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The nephew is 10 years old today.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much money Sharon received from the tooth fairy in total.

---

### Step 1: First tooth
- The tooth fairy left **$5.00** for the first tooth.

$$
\text{First tooth} = \$5.00
$$

---

### Step 2: Next three teeth
- For each of the next **three teeth**, Sharon got **$1.00** per tooth.

$$
\text{Next three teeth} = 3 \times \$1.00 = \$3.00
$$

---

### Step 3: Last two teeth
- For each of the last **two teeth**, the tooth fairy gave **half the amount** that Sharon received for each of the previous three teeth.
- The amount for each of the previous three teeth was **$1.00**, so:
  
$$
\text{Amount per last tooth} = \frac{1}{2} \times \$1.00 = \$0.50
$$

- So for the last two teeth:

$$
\text{Last two teeth} = 2 \times \$0.50 = \$1.00
$$

---

### Step 4: Total amount
Now, let's add up all the amounts:

$$
\$5.00 + \$3.00 + \$1.00 = \boxed{\$9.00}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$9.00}
$$
We are given the following information:

- Richie scored **80 goals**.
- Richie scored **20 more goals than Mark**.
- Richie scored **45 more goals than Anna**.

Let’s define variables for clarity:

- Let $ R $ be the number of goals Richie scored.  
  Given: $ R = 80 $

- Let $ M $ be the number of goals Mark scored.

- Let $ A $ be the number of goals Anna scored.

From the problem:

1. $ R = M + 20 $ → $ 80 = M + 20 $ → Solve for $ M $:
   $$
   M = 80 - 20 = 60
   $$

2. $ R = A + 45 $ → $ 80 = A + 45 $ → Solve for $ A $:
   $$
   A = 80 - 45 = 35
   $$

Now, add up all three teenagers' goals:

$$
R + M + A = 80 + 60 + 35 = 175
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **175 goals**.

- **Liam** made **$63**.
- **Mitchell** sold **21 lemonades at $4 each**.

We are asked: **How many more dollars did Mitchell make than Liam?**

---

### Step 1: Calculate Mitchell's earnings

Mitchell sold 21 lemonades at $4 each:

$$
21 \times 4 = 84
$$

So, Mitchell made **$84**.

---

### Step 2: Compare Mitchell's and Liam's earnings

Mitchell made **$84**, and Liam made **$63**.

$$
84 - 63 = 21
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Mitchell made $21 more than Liam.**
We are told that Peter has **$70** and wants to spend an **equal amount each day for one week (7 days)**. 

Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how much Peter spends per day

He has $70 and wants to spend it over **7 days**, so:

$$
\text{Daily spending} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \text{ dollars per day}
$$

So, Peter spends **$10 each day** for the entire week.

---

### Step 2: Break down the week into two parts

- From **Sunday through Wednesday** (5 days), he buys **wooden action figures** at **$5 each**.
- For the **remaining 2 days** (Thursday and Friday), he buys **plastic action figures** at **$2 each**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate total money spent on wooden action figures

He spends **$10 per day** for **5 days**:

$$
\text{Money spent on wooden figures} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
$$

Each wooden figure costs **$5**, so:

$$
\text{Number of wooden figures} = \frac{50}{5} = 10
$$

---

### Step 4: Calculate total money spent on plastic action figures

He spends **$10 per day** for **2 days**:

$$
\text{Money spent on plastic figures} = 10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ dollars}
$$

Each plastic figure costs **$2**, so:

$$
\text{Number of plastic figures} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
$$

---

### Step 5: Add both types of figures

$$
\text{Total action figures} = 10 \text{ (wooden)} + 10 \text{ (plastic)} = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{20}
$$
Let's break down the costs step by step:

1. **Spaying the kitten:**  
   $200

   So, $ 3 \times 20 = 60 $

3. **Broken vases:**  
   The kitten broke 4 vases, each costing $12.  
   So, $ 4 \times 12 = 48 $

Now, let's add all these amounts together:

$$
200 + 60 + 48 = 308
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$308**

### **Step 1: Determine the total number of roses Ford grows in a week.**

Ford grows:
- 40 roses every week

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the total number of roses ordered by all flower shops in a week.**

The three flower shops order:
- First shop: 20 roses  
- Second shop: 15 roses  
- Third shop: 30 roses  

**Total per week:**  
$$
20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all shops each week.**

Ford grows **40 roses**, but the shops need **65 roses**.

So, the number of roses he **lacks** each week is:
$$
65 - 40 = 25 \text{ roses}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the number of roses Ford lacks in a month (4 weeks).**

$$
25 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 100 \text{ roses}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Ford lacks **100 roses** to supply all the flower shops every month.
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the initial amount
Katina starts with **$3000** in her savings account.

### Step 2: Determine how much she removes each month
She removes **$100** every month.

### Step 3: Find out how many months are in 2 years
- 1 year = 12 months  
- So, 2 years = $ 12 \times 2 = 24 $ months

### Step 4: Calculate total amount removed over 2 years
- Total removed = $ 100 \times 24 = 2400 $

### Step 5: Subtract the total removed from the initial amount
- Remaining amount = $ 3000 - 2400 = 600 $

### ✅ Final Answer:
**$600** will be remaining in Katina's savings account after 2 years.
Let's break this down step by step to find the **net profit**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the cost per sandwich**

- **Cost of bread per loaf**: $3.00  
  - Each loaf makes **10 sandwiches**, so:
    - **Cost of bread per sandwich** = $ \frac{3.00}{10} = 0.30 $ dollars

- **Cost of cheese and condiments per 10 sandwiches**: $30.00  
  - So, **cost per sandwich** = $ \frac{30.00}{10} = 3.00 $ dollars

- **Total cost per sandwich** = Bread + Cheese/Condiments  
  = $ 0.30 + 3.00 = 3.30 $ dollars

---

### **Step 2: Revenue per sandwich**

- They sell each sandwich for **$7.00**

---

### **Step 3: Profit per sandwich**

- **Profit per sandwich** = Revenue - Cost  
  = $ 7.00 - 3.30 = 3.70 $ dollars

---

### **Step 4: Net profit for 10 sandwiches**

- **Net profit** = Profit per sandwich × Number of sandwiches  
  = $ 3.70 × 10 = 37.00 $ dollars

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**Net profit = $37.00**
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much money Kate can make.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of crayon pieces**

\boxed{\$36}
$$

Kate can make **\$36** by selling her crayon muffins.
Let's break this down step by step to find the total cost for Michael to replace the carpet.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the area of the bedroom**
The bedroom is rectangular, with dimensions:
- Length = 18 feet  
- Width = 12 feet  

So, the **area** is:

$$
\text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 18 \times 12 = 216 \text{ square feet}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine the cost components**

There are four cost components involved in replacing the carpet:

#### **A. Cost of new carpet and padding**
- Carpet costs: $12 per square foot  
- Padding costs: $2 per square foot  
- Total cost for carpet + padding = $12 + $2 = **$14 per square foot**

#### **B. Cost to remove old carpet**
- Contractor charges: **$4 per square foot**

#### **C. Cost to install new carpet**
- Contractor charges: **$34 per square foot**

#### **D. Total cost per square foot**
Add up all the costs per square foot:

$$
\text{Total cost per sq ft} = 14 (\text{carpet + padding}) + 4 (\text{removal}) + 34 (\text{installation}) = 52 \text{ dollars per square foot}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Multiply by the area to get the total cost**

$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{Area} \times \text{Cost per square foot} = 216 \times 52
$$

Now calculate that:

$$
216 \times 52 = (200 \times 52) + (16 \times 52) = 10,400 + 832 = 11,232
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$11,232}
$$

Michael will spend **\$11,232** to replace the carpet.
Let's break this down step by step to find the **average number of birds Mack saw per day** over the 7 days.

---

### Step 1: Add up the total number of birds seen each day

We are told:

- **Day 1 and Day 2:** Total = 50 birds  
- **Day 3:** 0 birds  
- **Days 4 and 5:** Total = 120 birds  
- **Day 6:** 20 birds  
- **Day 7:** 90 birds  

Now, let's add all these together:

$$
\text{Total birds} = 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90
$$

$$
\text{Total birds} = 280
$$

---

### Step 2: Divide by the number of days

Mack observed birds over **7 days**, so we divide the total by 7:

$$
\text{Average per day} = \frac{280}{7} = 40
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**On average, Mack saw 40 birds per day.**
We are given a number train problem with the following steps:

1. **Starting value** = 20  
2. Add half of the number to the starting value:  
   $$
   20 + \frac{1}{2} \times 20
   $$
3. Divide the result by 5:  
   $$
   \frac{20 + \frac{1}{2} \times 20}{5}
   $$
4. Multiply the result by the **starting value minus 12**:  
   $$
   \left( \frac{20 + \frac{1}{2} \times 20}{5} \right) \times (20 - 12)
   $$

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Compute half of the starting value
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
$$

---

### Step 2: Add that to the starting value
$$
20 + 10 = 30
$$

---

### Step 3: Divide by 5
$$
\frac{30}{5} = 6
$$

---

### Step 4: Multiply by the starting value minus 12
$$
20 - 12 = 8
$$
$$
6 \times 8 = 48
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{48}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

1. **The boy has 5 cards.**

2. **His brother has 3 fewer cards than he has.**  
   So, the brother has:  
   $ 5 - 3 = 2 $ cards.

3. **To find how many cards they have together**, we add the number of cards each has:  
   $ 5 + 2 = 7 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **7 cards**.
We are told that Maggie's oven is **off by the same percentage** when set to 450°F, and it actually reaches **468°F**. We need to find what temperature she should set the oven to if her recipe calls for **520°F**, so that the oven will actually reach **520°F**.

---

### Step 1: Find the percentage error

The oven is set to **450°F**, but it reaches **468°F**.  
So the actual temperature is **higher** than the set temperature.

Let’s compute the percentage increase:

$$
\text{Percentage Increase} = \frac{\text{Actual} - \text{Set}}{\text{Set}} \times 100
$$

$$
= \frac{468 - 450}{450} \times 100 = \frac{18}{450} \times 100 = 0.04 \times 100 = 4\%
$$

So, the oven is **overheating by 4%** — meaning it **increases the temperature by 4%** of the set value.

---

### Step 2: Use this percentage to find the correct setting for 520°F

We want the oven to **actually reach 520°F**, but it over-heats by **4%**. So we need to **set it lower** than 520°F, such that after a 4% increase, it equals 520°F.

Let $ x $ be the temperature she should set the oven to. Then:

$$
x + 0.04x = 520 \\
1.04x = 520
$$

Now solve for $ x $:

$$
x = \frac{520}{1.04}
$$

$$
x = 500
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Maggie should set the oven to **500°F** so that it actually reaches **520°F**.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Convert the first movie time to minutes
- The first movie is **1 hour and 30 minutes**.
- Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, we have:
  $$
  1\ \text{hour} + 30\ \text{minutes} = 60 + 30 = 90\ \text{minutes}
  $$

### Step 2: Convert the second movie time to minutes
- The second movie is **2 hours and 5 minutes**.
- Again, 1 hour = 60 minutes, so:
  $$
  2\ \text{hours} + 5\ \text{minutes} = (2 \times 60) + 5 = 120 + 5 = 125\ \text{minutes}
  $$

### Step 3: Add the two times together
$$
90\ \text{minutes} + 125\ \text{minutes} = 215\ \text{minutes}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{215}\ \text{minutes}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the value of Juan's house
We are told that **Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's**.  
Herb's house costs **$76,000**.

So, we need to find 30% of $76,000 and subtract it from $76,000 to get the price of Juan's house.

$$
\text{30% of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800
$$

Now subtract that from Herb's house value:

$$
\text{Juan's house} = 76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200
$$

### Step 2: Add the values of both houses
Now we add the value of Herb's house and Juan's house:

$$
\text{Total value} = 76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$129,200}
$$
Let's break this problem down step by step.

Judy bought **a dozen cups**.  
A dozen = 12

So, **Judy brought 12 cups**.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many dishes Judy brought
She brought **twice as many dishes as cups**.

So,  
$$
\text{Dishes} = 2 \times \text{Cups} = 2 \times 12 = 24
$$

Judy brought **24 dishes**.

---

### Step 3: Total utensils Judy brought
$$
\text{Total utensils (Judy)} = \text{Cups} + \text{Dishes} = 12 + 24 = 36

---

### Step 4: Determine how many cups her friend brought
Her friend brought **40 cups**.

---

### Step 5: Determine how many dishes her friend brought
Her friend brought **20 more dishes than Judy**.

So,
$$
\text{Friend's dishes} = 24 + 20 = 44
$$

---

### Step 6: Total utensils her friend brought
$$
\text{Total utensils (Friend)} = \text{Cups} + \text{Dishes} = 40 + 44 = 84
$$

---

### Step 7: Total number of utensils brought by both
$$
\text{Total utensils} = \text{Judy's total} + \text{Friend's total} = 36 + 84 = \boxed{120}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{120}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

- **90 single-use contacts per box**
- **Lasts Pete 45 days**

So, Pete uses:
$$
\frac{90 \text{ contacts}}{45 \text{ days}} = 2 \text{ contacts per day}
$$

---

### 2. **Determine how many contacts Pete uses in 2 boxes:**
- Each box has **90 contacts**, so:
$$
2 \text{ boxes} \times 90 \text{ contacts/box} = 180 \text{ contacts}
$$

---

### 3. **Find the total cost of 2 boxes with a 10% discount:**
- Original price per box = **$100**
- 2 boxes = $100 × 2 = **$200**
- 10% off = 0.10 × $200 = **$20**
- Discounted total = $200 - $20 = **$180**

---

### 4. **Calculate the cost per contact:**
$$
\frac{\$180}{180 \text{ contacts}} = \$1.00 \text{ per contact}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Each pair of contacts costs $2.00.**

Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate total calories burned**

- **Aerobics:**  
  She does aerobics for **2 hours**, and it burns **500 calories/hour**.  
  So,  
  $$
  2 \text{ hours} \times 500 \text{ calories/hour} = 1000 \text{ calories}
  $$

- **Running:**  
  She runs for **1 hour**, and it burns **600 calories/hour**.  
  So,  
  $$
  1 \text{ hour} \times 600 \text{ calories/hour} = 600 \text{ calories}
  $$

- **Total calories burned:**  
  $$
  1000 + 600 = 1600 \text{ calories}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate water needed**

Hannah needs to drink **100 ml of water for every 200 calories** burned.

So, the amount of water she needs is:
$$
\frac{1600 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ calories}} \times 100 \text{ ml} = 8 \times 100 \text{ ml} = 800 \text{ ml}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{800 \text{ ml}}
$$
We are told:

- The jar contains **red**, **blue**, and **green** jelly beans.
- There are a total of **4500 jelly beans**.
- The number of **red** jelly beans is **1% fewer** than the number of **blue** jelly beans.
- The number of **green** jelly beans is **1% more** than the number of **blue** jelly beans.

We are asked: **How many more green jelly beans does it contain than red jelly beans?**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ B $ = number of **blue** jelly beans
- $ R $ = number of **red** jelly beans
- $ G $ = number of **green** jelly beans

From the problem:

- $ R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B $
- $ G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B $

Also, the total number of jelly beans is:

$$
R + B + G = 4500
$$

Substitute $ R = 0.99B $ and $ G = 1.01B $ into the equation:

$$
0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
$$

Simplify:

$$
(0.99 + 1 + 1.01)B = 4500 \\
3B = 4500
$$

So:

$$
B = \frac{4500}{3} = 1500
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the number of red and green jelly beans

- $ R = 0.99B = 0.99 \times 1500 = 1485 $
- $ G = 1.01B = 1.01 \times 1500 = 1515 $

---

### Step 3: Find how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans

$$
G - R = 1515 - 1485 = 30
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{30}
$$

There are **30 more green jelly beans** than red jelly beans.

Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Given:**
- **Cheerios:** Martin loses **1.25 pounds per week**.
- **Donuts:** Martin gains **1.75 pounds per week**.
- Time period: **5 weeks**.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate weight change for Cheerios**

Martin loses:
$$
1.25 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 6.25 \, \text{pounds}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate weight change for Donuts**

Martin gains:
$$
1.75 \, \text{pounds/week} \times 5 \, \text{weeks} = 8.75 \, \text{pounds}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the difference in weight between the two options**

Difference = Weight gain (Donuts) - Weight loss (Cheerios)
$$
8.75 \, \text{pounds} - 6.25 \, \text{pounds} = 2.5 \, \text{pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{2.5 \text{ pounds}}
$$

Martin will be **2.5 pounds heavier** at the end of 5 weeks if he eats donuts instead of Cheerios.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many seats Alex will need.

---

### **Step 1: People invited via email**
Alex invites **100 people** via email.

Each of these 100 people says they will also invite **2 of their friends**.

So, the number of additional people invited by the initial 100 is:

$$
100 \times 2 = 200 \text{ people}
$$

So far, we have:
- 100 (original invitees)
- +200 (friends invited by them)

Total so far:  
$$
100 + 200 = 300 \text{ people}
$$

---

### **Step 2: People called directly**
Alex calls **10 of her friends** to invite them too.

So that’s **10 more people**.

Now total is:
$$
300 + 10 = 310 \text{ people}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Spouses from the 10 called friends**
Out of the 10 friends she called, **8 say they will be bringing their spouses**.

That means **8 more people** will come in addition to the 10 called friends.

So now total is:
$$
310 + 8 = 318 \text{ people}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{318} \text{ seats}
$$

Alex will need **318 seats** for everyone.
Let's break this down step by step.

We are told there are **four dogs** in a line, and we're given their weights in relation to each other. We need to find the **weight of the Mastiff**, which is at the end of the line.

---

### Step 1: Assign variables based on the information

Let’s define the weight of each dog:

- Let the **Affenpinscher** weigh **10 pounds** (given).
- The **Dachshund** weighs **twice as much as the Affenpinscher**, so:
  
  $$
  \text{Dachshund} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ pounds}
  $$

- The **Papillon** weighs **one-fourth as much as the Dachshund**, so:

  $$
  \text{Papillon} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ pounds}
  $$

- The **Mastiff** weighs **44 times the weight of the Papillon**, so:

  $$
  \text{Mastiff} = 44 \times 5 = 220 \text{ pounds}
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{220} \text{ pounds}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost on Amazon.com
- Price of boots: **$16**
- Shipping cost: **$4**

**Total cost on Amazon = $16 + $4 = $20**

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost on eBay
- Price of boots: **$13**
- Shipping cost is **twice as much as on Amazon**, so:
  
  **Shipping cost on eBay = 2 × $4 = $8**

**Total cost on eBay = $13 + $8 = $21**

---

### Step 3: Find the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon

**Difference = Total cost on eBay – Total cost on Amazon**  
= $21 – $20 = **$1**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
The boots are **$1 more expensive** on eBay.
We are told:

- The beanstalk starts at **4 feet** tall.
- It **doubles in height every day**.
- Mark's window is **20 feet** off the ground.
- We need to find how many **days** it will take for the beanstalk to be **taller than 20 feet**.

---

### Step-by-step:

Let’s define the height of the beanstalk after **n days** as:

$$
\text{Height} = 4 \times 2^n
$$

We want to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that:

$$
4 \times 2^n > 20
$$

---

### Step 1: Solve the inequality

$$
4 \times 2^n > 20
$$

Divide both sides by 4:

$$
2^n > 5
$$

Now, solve for $ n $:

Try values of $ n $:

- $ n = 0 $: $ 2^0 = 1 $
- $ n = 1 $: $ 2^1 = 2 $
- $ n = 2 $: $ 2^2 = 4 $
- $ n = 3 $: $ 2^3 = 8 $
- $ n = 4 $: $ 2^4 = 16 $
- $ n = 5 $: $ 2^5 = 32 $

So:

$$
2^3 = 8 < 5 \Rightarrow \text{No}
$$
$$
2^4 = 16 > 5 \Rightarrow \text{Yes}
$$

Thus, the smallest $ n $ where $ 2^n > 5 $ is **4**.

---

### Step 2: Verify the height on day 4

$$
\text{Height on day 4} = 4 \times 2^4 = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ feet}
$$

Which is indeed **greater than 20 feet**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{4} \text{ days}
$$

It will take **4 days** for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Protein per gram of mushrooms
- A **100-gram** cup of mushrooms has **3 grams of protein**.
- So, the protein content per gram is:
  
  $$
  \frac{3 \text{ grams of protein}}{100 \text{ grams of mushrooms}} = 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram of mushrooms}
  $$

### Step 2: Protein in 200 grams of mushrooms
- John eats **200 grams** of mushrooms each day.
- So, the protein he gets per day is:

  $$
  200 \text{ grams} \times 0.03 \text{ grams of protein per gram} = 6 \text{ grams of protein per day}
  $$

### Step 3: Protein per week
- There are **7 days** in a week.
- So, the total protein he gets in a week is:

  $$
  6 \text{ grams/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ grams of protein per week}
  $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**John gets 42 grams of protein per week.**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Let Jerry's current age be $ x $ years.

---

### Step 2: According to the problem:

> Jerry is **twice as old as he was 5 years ago**.

So, 5 years ago, Jerry was $ x - 5 $ years old.

We are told that his **current age** is **twice** that:

$$
x = 2(x - 5)
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve the equation.

$$
x = 2(x - 5) \\
x = 2x - 10 \\
x - 2x = -10 \\
- x = -10 \\
x = 10
$$

So, Jerry is currently **10 years old**.

---

### Step 4: Find how old Jerry will be in 3 years.

$$
10 + 3 = 13
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many hours George needs to work to afford the dental work.

---

### **1. Total Cost of Dental Work**

- **2 implants**, each costing **$2000**:
  $$
  2 \times 2000 = \$4000
  $$

- **One implant with a porcelain crown**, which costs an extra **$500**:
  $$
  4000 + 500 = \$4500
  $$

So, **total cost = \$4500**

---

### **2. Deposit Already Paid**

George has already paid a deposit of **\$600**.

So, the remaining amount he needs is:
$$
4500 - 600 = \$3900
$$

---

### **3. Hourly Wage**

George earns **\$15 per hour**.

To find how many hours he needs to work to earn **\$3900**, divide:

$$
\frac{3900}{15} = 260 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
George needs to work **260 hours** to afford the dental work.
We are given the following information about a triangle:

- The **sum of the three angles** in a triangle is **180 degrees**.
- One angle is **twice the smallest angle**.
- Another angle is **three times the smallest angle**.

Let’s define the **smallest angle** as $ x $ degrees.

Then:
- The second angle is $ 2x $ (twice the smallest angle),
- The third angle is $ 3x $ (three times the smallest angle).

Now, since the sum of all three angles is 180 degrees, we can write the equation:

$$
x + 2x + 3x = 180
$$

Simplify:

$$
6x = 180
$$

Divide both sides by 6:

$$
x = 30
$$

So the smallest angle is $ 30^\circ $.

Now find the other two angles:

- Second angle: $ 2x = 2 \times 30 = 60^\circ $
- Third angle: $ 3x = 3 \times 30 = 90^\circ $

The **largest angle** is therefore:

$$
\boxed{90^\circ}
$$ ✅

---

### ✅ Final Answer: $\boxed{90}$ degrees.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the value of each type of coin**

- **Quarter** = 25 cents  
- **Dime** = 10 cents  
- **Nickel** = 5 cents  
- **Penny** = 1 cent  

Colby has:

- 8 quarters  
- 6 dimes  
- 14 nickels  
- 15 pennies  

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total amount of money Colby has**

We'll convert all coins to cents and add them up.

#### Quarters:
$$
8 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents} = 200 \text{ cents}
$$

#### Dimes:
$$
6 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents} = 60 \text{ cents}
$$

#### Nickels:
$$
14 \text{ nickels} \times 5 \text{ cents} = 70 \text{ cents}
$$

#### Pennies:
$$
15 \text{ pennies} \times 1 \text{ cent} = 15 \text{ cents}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add all amounts together**

$$
200 + 60 + 70 + 15 = 345 \text{ cents}
$$

So, Colby has a total of **345 cents**.

---

### **Step 4: Determine how many gumballs he can buy**

Each gumball costs **a nickel**, which is **5 cents**.

To find out how many gumballs he can buy:

$$
\frac{345 \text{ cents}}{5 \text{ cents per gumball}} = 69 \text{ gumballs}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Colby can buy 69 gumballs.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Count the number of legs for each type of pet

- **Dogs**: Each dog has **4 legs**  
  - There are **5 dogs**, so:  
    $ 5 \text{ dogs} \times 4 \text{ legs/dog} = 20 \text{ legs} $

- **Cats**: Each cat has **4 legs**  
  - There are **2 cats**, so:  
    $ 2 \text{ cats} \times 4 \text{ legs/cat} = 8 \text{ legs} $

- **Birds**: Each bird has **2 legs**  
  - There are **10 birds**, so:  
    $ 10 \text{ birds} \times 2 \text{ legs/bird} = 20 \text{ legs} $

### Step 2: Add all the legs together

$$
20 \text{ (dogs)} + 8 \text{ (cats)} + 20 \text{ (birds)} = 48 \text{ legs}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**48 legs** in total.
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Initial weight**: Jamaal is using an **8-pound** weight.

2. **He increases the weight by 50%**:
   - 50% of 8 pounds = $ 0.5 \times 8 = 4 $ pounds
   - So, the new weight he tries is:  
     $ 8 + 4 = 12 $ pounds

3. **But it turns out to be too heavy**, so he uses a weight that is **2 pounds lighter** than 12 pounds:
   - $ 12 - 2 = 10 $ pounds

### ✅ Final Answer: **10 pounds**

We are given that a plane travels **1200 miles in 3 hours**, and we want to find out how many **additional hours** it would take to travel an **additional 2000 miles** at the same rate.

---

### Step 1: Find the plane's speed

Speed is calculated as:

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
$$

$$
\text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the speed to find time for the additional distance

Now, we want to know how long it would take to travel **2000 miles** at this speed.

Use the formula:

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
$$

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

It would take **5 additional hours** to travel the extra 2000 miles.
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Determine how much Ruiz makes in one hour**

Ruiz can make **120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours**.

So, in **one hour**, Ruiz makes:

$$
\frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how much Marissa makes in one hour**

Marissa makes **3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour** as Ruiz makes in **two hours**.

From Step 1, Ruiz makes **120 pounds in 2 hours**, so:

$$
\text{Marissa's hourly rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90 \text{ pounds/hour}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total chocolate production per day**

They both work **12 hours per day**.

- Ruiz’s daily production:
  $$
  60 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 720 \text{ pounds}
  $$

- Marissa’s daily production:
  $$
  90 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1080 \text{ pounds}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Add their daily totals to find the combined amount**

$$
720 + 1080 = 1800 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{1800} \text{ pounds}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how much Howard spends each day

- **Monday**: Howard spends $8.
- **Tuesday**: He spends **twice as much** as Monday.  
  So, Tuesday = 2 × $8 = **$16**
- **Wednesday**: He spends **4 times as much** as Tuesday.  
  So, Wednesday = 4 × $16 = **$64**

### Step 2: Add up the total amount spent

Total spent = Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday  
= $8 + $16 + $64 = **$88**

### Step 3: Subtract from the original amount

Howard originally had **$100**.  
Money left = $100 - $88 = **$12**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$12**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over 6 hours.

---

### **Step 1: First 4 hours**
- **Rate of cups sold per hour:** 15 cups/hour  
- **Price per cup:** $0.50  
- **Total cups sold in 4 hours:**  
  $$
  15 \text{ cups/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 60 \text{ cups}
  $$
- **Earnings from first 4 hours:**  
  $$
  60 \text{ cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Next 2 hours**
- **Rate of cups sold per hour:** 10 cups/hour  
- **Price per cup:** $0.60  
- **Total cups sold in 2 hours:**  
  $$
  10 \text{ cups/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 20 \text{ cups}
  $$
- **Earnings from next 2 hours:**  
  $$
  20 \text{ cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Total Earnings**
$$
\$30 + \$12 = \$42
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$42}
$$
We are given the following information:

- **Every 2 miles**, a car's tires rotate **725 times**.
- **Jeremy drives 400 miles per month**.
- **Each tire can undergo 10,440,000 rotations** before needing replacement.

We need to find out: **How many years will it take before the tire needs to be replaced?**

---

### Step 1: Find how many rotations occur per mile

We know:
- 2 miles → 725 rotations  
So, per mile:
$$
\frac{725}{2} = 362.5 \text{ rotations per mile}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find total rotations per month

Jeremy drives **400 miles per month**, so:
$$
400 \times 362.5 = 145,000 \text{ rotations per month}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find total rotations per year

There are 12 months in a year:
$$
145,000 \times 12 = 1,740,000 \text{ rotations per year}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find how many years until the tire needs replacement

Each tire can handle **10,440,000 rotations**.

So, number of years before replacement:
$$
\frac{10,440,000}{1,740,000} = 6 \text{ years}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{6 \text{ years}}
$$
We are given:

- **Price of the shampoo bottle:** $24.00  
- **Directions:** 2 pumps = 120 washings  
- **Jackie uses:** 1 pump per washing  
- **We need to find:** Cost per pump in **cents**

---

### Step 1: Find total number of pumps in the bottle

From the directions:
- 2 pumps = 120 washings  
So, 1 washing = 2 pumps  
Therefore, for **120 washings**, Jackie would use:
$$
120 \text{ washings} \times 2 \text{ pumps/washing} = 240 \text{ pumps}
$$

So, the bottle contains **240 pumps**.

---

### Step 2: Find cost per pump

Total cost of the bottle is $24.00  
Number of pumps = 240

$$
\text{Cost per pump} = \frac{24.00}{240} = 0.10 \text{ dollars}
$$

Convert to cents:
$$
0.10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ cents}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{10} \text{ cents}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much money Joe will have left after his purchase.

---

### **Step 1: Total original cost of the items**

Joe buys:
- A shirt for **$25**
- Shorts for **$35**

So, total before any discount or tax:

$$
25 + 35 = 60 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Apply the 30% off sale**

The store is having a **30% off** sale. That means Joe gets **30% off** the total price of the items.

First, calculate 30% of $60:

$$
0.30 \times 60 = 18 \text{ dollars}
$$

Now subtract that from the original total to get the discounted price:

$$
60 - 18 = 42 \text{ dollars}
$$

So, the **discounted total** is **$42**.

---

### **Step 3: Add sales tax**

We are told to assume **sales tax is included**, but we aren't given the tax rate. However, in many cases, especially if not specified, it's reasonable to assume **sales tax is already included** in the final price (i.e., the $42 includes tax).

So, we'll assume the **$42 is the final amount Joe pays**, including tax.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate how much money Joe has left**

Joe started with **$50**.

He spent **$42**.

So, the amount he has left is:

$$
50 - 42 = 8 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{8} \text{ dollars}
$$

Joe will have **$8 left** after the purchase.
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Butter needed per dozen croissants**
It takes **1/4 pound of butter** to make **1 dozen croissants**.

---

### **Step 2: How many dozens Juan wants to make**
Juan wants to make **4 dozen croissants per day** for **a week**.

So, first find how many dozens he makes in a week:

$$
4 \text{ dozen/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 28 \text{ dozen}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total butter needed**
Now, multiply the number of dozens by the butter needed per dozen:

$$
28 \text{ dozen} \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound/dozen} = 7 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Juan will need **7 pounds of butter** to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Find the cost to repave Monica's street
- Cost per meter = $194
- Length of Monica's street = 150 meters

$$
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = 194 \times 150
$$

$$
= 29,100
$$

So, it costs **$29,100** to repave Monica's street.

---

### Step 2: Find the cost to repave Lewis' street
- Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters

$$
\text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 194 \times 490
$$

Let’s calculate this:

$$
194 \times 490 = 194 \times (500 - 10) = (194 \times 500) - (194 \times 10)
$$

$$
= 97,000 - 1,940 = 95,060
$$

So, it costs **$95,060** to repave Lewis' street.

---

### Step 3: Find how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street

$$
\text{Difference in cost} = 95,060 - 29,100 = 65,960
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
It costs **$65,960** more to repave Lewis' street than Monica's street.
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the initial funding**

- John gets **$100,000** for the **first 5 months** of research.
- So, the cost for the first 5 months is:

$$
\text{Cost for first 5 months} = 5 \times 100,000 = \$500,000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine the total time of the research**

- The research **takes 10 times longer** than the initial 5 months.
- So, total time = $ 5 \times 10 = 50 $ months.

---

### **Step 3: Determine the monthly funding after the first 5 months**

- After the first 5 months, **each month costs 50% more** than the original $100,000 per month.
- That means the new monthly cost is:

$$
100,000 + (50\% \text{ of } 100,000) = 100,000 + 50,000 = \$150,000 \text{ per month}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the cost for the remaining months**

- Total time = 50 months  
- First 5 months already accounted for → Remaining months = $ 50 - 5 = 45 $ months  
- Monthly cost after 5 months = $150,000  
- Cost for the remaining 45 months:

$$
45 \times 150,000 = 6,750,000
$$

---

### **Step 5: Add up all the costs**

- First 5 months: $500,000  
- Next 45 months: $6,750,000  

$$
\text{Total cost} = 500,000 + 6,750,000 = \boxed{\$7,250,000}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$7,250,000}
$$

Let's break this down step by step to find Ashley’s internet connection speed in **Mb per hour**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**

- **Speed = 20 kb/s** (kilobytes per second)
- **1 Mb = 1000 kb**
- We need to convert this speed to **Mb per hour**

---

### **Step 2: Convert kb/s to Mb/s**

We know that:

$$
1 \text{ Mb} = 1000 \text{ kb}
$$

So, to convert from **kb/s to Mb/s**, divide by 1000:

$$
\frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Convert seconds to hours**

There are:

- $60$ seconds in a minute  
- $60$ minutes in an hour

So:

$$
60 \times 60 = 3600 \text{ seconds in an hour}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Multiply Mb/s by seconds per hour**

Now, multiply the speed in **Mb/s** by the number of seconds in an hour to get **Mb per hour**:

$$
0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/hour} = 72 \text{ Mb/hour}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{72} \text{ Mb per hour}
$$
Let's break the problem down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the number of days in a week
A week has **7 days**.

### Step 2: Determine how many days the tow truck pulled **ten cars**
The problem says:
> "a tow truck pulled ten cars for each of the first three days"

So, for the **first 3 days**, it pulled **10 cars per day**.

- Total cars for first 3 days = $ 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars} $

### Step 3: Determine how many days the tow truck pulled **four fewer cars**
For the **remaining days**, it pulled **4 fewer cars** than 10.

- So, it pulled $ 10 - 4 = 6 $ cars per day.
- The remaining days = $ 7 - 3 = 4 $ days

- Total cars for the remaining 4 days = $ 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars} $

### Step 4: Add both parts to find the total number of cars towed that week

$$
\text{Total cars} = 30 + 24 = \boxed{54}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **54 cars**
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Convert the height requirement to inches:**
- The roller coaster requires a minimum height of **4 feet**.

  4 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches}
  $$

### 2. **Adam’s current height:**
- Adam is currently **40 inches tall**.

### 3. **How much taller does he need to be?**
$$
48 \text{ inches (required)} - 40 \text{ inches (current)} = 8 \text{ inches}
$$

### 4. **How much does Adam grow each year?**
- Adam grows **2 inches per year**.

### 5. **How many years until he reaches the required height?**
$$
\frac{8 \text{ inches needed}}{2 \text{ inches per year}} = 4 \text{ years}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**4 years** until Adam is tall enough to ride the roller coaster.
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much **James made** from selling the cars.

---

### **Step 1: Total revenue from car sales**

James sold **10 cars**, each costing **$25,000**.

$$
\text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times \$25,000 = \$250,000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Cost to the company (what they paid to acquire the cars)**

The company paid **30% of the price** to acquire each car.

$$
\text{Cost per car} = 0.30 \times \$25,000 = \$7,500
$$

$$
\text{Total cost for 10 cars} = 10 \times \$7,500 = \$75,000
$$

---

### **Step 3: Profit for the company**

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = \$250,000 - \$75,000 = \$175,000
$$

---

### **Step 4: James’s commission on the profit**

James gets a **10% commission on the profit**.

$$
\text{Commission} = 0.10 \times \$175,000 = \$17,500
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\$17,500}
$$

James made **\$17,500** from selling the cars.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Total number of riders
- There are **100 riders**.

### Step 2: Percentage of riders who can stay upright
- Only **25%** of the riders can stay upright.
- So, the number of riders who can stay upright is:
  $$
  100 \times 0.25 = 25 \text{ riders}
  $$

### Step 3: Percentage of these riders who are women
- Of the 25 riders who can stay upright, **60%** are women.
- So, the number of women who can stay upright is:
  $$
  25 \times 0.60 = 15 \text{ women}
  $$

### Step 4: Find the number of men who can stay upright
- Since there are 25 riders who can stay upright in total, and 15 of them are women, the rest must be men:
  $$
  25 - 15 = 10 \text{ men}
  $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**10 men** can stay upright on the wave.
We are given the following information:

1. **Price of a diamond jewel = $2000**
2. **Price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times the price of a diamond jewel**
3. **Price of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of a gold jewel**

Let's solve step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find the price of the gold jewel

The price of the gold jewel is:

$$
\text{Gold Jewel} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Diamond Jewel}
$$

$$
= \frac{4}{5} \times 2000 = 1600
$$

So, the **gold jewel costs $1600**.

---

### Step 2: Find the price of the silver jewel

The price of the silver jewel is $400 less than the gold jewel:

$$
\text{Silver Jewel} = \text{Gold Jewel} - 400 = 1600 - 400 = 1200
$$

So, the **silver jewel costs $1200**.

---

### Step 3: Find the total price for all three jewels

Now we add up the prices:

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Diamond} + \text{Gold} + \text{Silver}
$$

$$
= 2000 + 1600 + 1200 = 4800
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\$4800}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Define the number of each type of stamp

We are told:

- Max bought **16 snowflake stamps**.
- He bought **3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps**.
- He bought **9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps**.

Let’s define:

- Snowflake stamps = **S**
- Truck stamps = **T**
- Rose stamps = **R**

From the problem:

- $ S = 16 $
- $ T = S + 3 $
- $ R = T - 9 $

### Step 2: Plug in the values

First, find the number of **truck stamps**:

$$
T = S + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19
$$

Now, find the number of **rose stamps**:

$$
R = T - 9 = 19 - 9 = 10
$$

### Step 3: Find the total number of stamps

$$
\text{Total} = S + T + R = 16 + 19 + 10 = 45
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Max bought 45 stamps in all.**
We are given:

- **Bob is 75 miles ahead** of Tom.
- **Bob's speed**: 55 mph
- **Tom's speed**: 70 mph

We want to find out how long it will take **Tom to catch up with Bob**.

---

### Step 1: Determine the relative speed

Since both are moving in the same direction, we calculate the **relative speed** between Tom and Bob.

$$
\text{Relative speed} = \text{Tom's speed} - \text{Bob's speed} = 70 - 55 = 15 \text{ mph}
$$

This means Tom is **gaining on Bob at a rate of 15 miles per hour**.

---

### Step 2: Use the formula for time

We know the distance between them is 75 miles, and Tom is gaining at 15 mph.

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative speed}} = \frac{75}{15} = 5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**It will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.**
We are given the following information:

1. **Naomi caught 17 fish.**
2. **Darren caught 6 less than Naomi.**
3. **Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren.**

---

### Step 1: Find how many fish Darren caught
Darren caught 6 less than Naomi:

$$
\text{Darren} = \text{Naomi} - 6 = 17 - 6 = 11
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many fish Tommy caught
Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren:

$$
\text{Tommy} = \text{Darren} + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{14}
$$

Tommy caught **14 fish**.
We are given the following information:

- Manny signed up for **10 classes**.
- The total cost is **$60**.
- His parents will **not sign him up again** if the cost per class exceeds **$10**.
- We need to find **how many classes Manny can miss** before the cost per class exceeds $10.

---

### Step 1: Understand the cost per class

If Manny takes all 10 classes, the cost per class is:

$$
\frac{60}{10} = 6 \text{ dollars per class}
$$

That's under $10, so his parents would be okay with that.

But we want to know how many classes he can **miss**, so that the **cost per class increases above $10**.

Let’s say he misses **x** classes. Then he only attends:

$$
10 - x \text{ classes}
$$

The cost per class becomes:

$$
\frac{60}{10 - x}
$$

We want this to be **greater than $10**:

$$
\frac{60}{10 - x} > 10
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve the inequality

$$
\frac{60}{10 - x} > 10
$$

Multiply both sides by $10 - x$, but remember: since $10 - x > 0$ (he can't miss more than 10 classes), we don’t have to flip the inequality.

$$
60 > 10(10 - x)
$$

$$
60 > 100 - 10x
$$

Subtract 100 from both sides:

$$
-40 > -10x
$$

Divide both sides by -10 (and reverse the inequality):

$$
4 < x
$$

So,

$$
x > 4
$$

This means Manny must miss **more than 4 classes**.

---

### Step 3: Find the smallest whole number of classes he can miss

Since $x > 4$, the smallest integer value of $x$ is **5**.

So, Manny can miss **5 or more classes** before the cost per class exceeds $10.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Manny can miss 5 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.**
Let's break the problem down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the relationship between Julie and Jewel’s speeds**

- Julie operates the cash register **twice as fast** as Jewel.
- That means if Jewel processes **1 customer per minute**, Julie processes **2 customers per minute**.

So, **Julie's speed = 2 × Jewel's speed**

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many customers Jewel processes daily**

- It is given that **Jewel processes 50 customers per day**.

---

### **Step 3: Find out how many customers Julie processes daily**

Since Julie is twice as fast as Jewel, she can process **twice as many customers** in the same amount of time.

$$
\text{Julie's daily customers} = 2 \times 50 = 100
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate total daily production for both**

$$
\text{Total daily customers} = \text{Jewel's customers} + \text{Julie's customers} = 50 + 100 = 150
$$

---

### **Step 5: Calculate weekly production (7 days a week)**

$$
\text{Weekly total} = 150 \times 7 = 1050
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{1050}
$$

So, the total weekly production for the two is **1050 customers**.
We are given the following information:

- **Paisley ran 4 miles.**
- **Reggie ran 5 times what Paisley ran.**
- **Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn.**

Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find how far Reggie ran

Reggie ran **5 times** what Paisley ran.

$$
\text{Reggie} = 5 \times \text{Paisley} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the relationship between Reggie and Lynn

It is stated that:

$$
\text{Reggie} = \text{Lynn} + 3
$$

Substitute the value of Reggie from above:

$$
20 = \text{Lynn} + 3
$$

Now solve for Lynn:

$$
\text{Lynn} = 20 - 3 = 17
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{17} \text{ miles}
$$

So, **Lynn ran 17 miles.**

To find out how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we need to follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the volume of the hole**

The hole is a rectangular prism, so the volume is:

$$
\text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
$$

Given:
- Length = 6 feet  
- Width = 4 feet  
- Depth = 3 feet  

$$
\text{Volume} = 6 \times 4 \times 3 = 72 \text{ cubic feet}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how long it takes to shovel 1 cubic foot**

It takes Bob **3 seconds** to shovel **1 cubic foot** of earth.

---

### **Step 3: Multiply the volume by the time per cubic foot**

$$
\text{Total time} = 72 \text{ cubic feet} \times 3 \text{ seconds per cubic foot} = 216 \text{ seconds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{216 \text{ seconds}}

Let's break this down step by step to find out how much Tim will make in a year.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the new monthly salary after the 5% raise**

Tim's original monthly salary is:

$$
\$20,000
$$

He gets a **5% raise**:

$$
\text{Raise} = 0.05 \times 20,000 = \$1,000
$$

So his **new monthly salary** is:

$$
\$20,000 + \$1,000 = \$21,000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the bonus**

The bonus is **half a month's salary**, based on his **new salary** of \$21,000:

$$
\text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times 21,000 = \$10,500
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate annual salary**

Now, we calculate how much he makes in a year with the new salary and the bonus.

First, annual salary from the new monthly salary:

$$
\$21,000 \times 12 = \$252,000
$$

Add the bonus:

$$
\$252,000 + \$10,500 = \$262,500
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$262,500}
$$

Tim will make **\$262,500** in a year.
Let's break this down step by step to find the total cost of everything James bought.

---

### **1. Cost of suits**
- James buys **10 suits**.

$$
\text{Total cost of suits} = 10 \times 750 = 7500
$$

---

### **2. Cost of dress pants**
- James buys **10 dress pants**.
- Each pair of dress pants costs **1/5** of the cost of a suit.

$$
\text{Cost of one pair of pants} = \frac{1}{5} \times 750 = 150
$$

$$
\text{Total cost of dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = 1500
$$

---

### **3. Cost of dress shirts**
- James buys **3 dress shirts per suit**, and he has **10 suits**.

$$
\text{Total number of dress shirts} = 10 \times 3 = 30
$$

- Each dress shirt costs **$60**.

$$
\text{Total cost of dress shirts} = 30 \times 60 = 1800
$$

---

### **4. Total cost of everything**

$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of suits} + \text{Cost of dress pants} + \text{Cost of dress shirts}
$$

$$
\text{Total cost} = 7500 + 1500 + 1800 = 10800
$$

---

560 + 280 = 840
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The two websites published a total of 840 articles together in February.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Steve's age**:  
   Steve is 60 years old.

2. **His wife's age**:  
   His wife is 4 years older than Steve, so:  
   $$
   60 + 4 = 64 \text{ years old}
   $$

3. **Their son's age**:  
   Their son is currently half as old as his mom (Steve's wife).  
   So:
   $$
   \frac{64}{2} = 32 \text{ years old}
   $$

4. **Son's wife's age**:  
   The son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband (the son).  
   So:
   $$
   32 - 3 = 29 \text{ years old}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.**

To find the total distance that Alisa and Stanley biked, we'll calculate the distance each of them traveled separately using the formula:

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
$$

---

### Step 1: Calculate the distance Alisa biked

- **Speed** = 12 miles per hour  
- **Time** = 4.5 hours  

$$
\text{Distance}_{\text{Alisa}} = 12 \times 4.5 = 54 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the distance Stanley biked

- **Speed** = 10 miles per hour  
- **Time** = 2.5 hours  

$$
\text{Distance}_{\text{Stanley}} = 10 \times 2.5 = 25 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add the distances together

$$
\text{Total Distance} = 54 + 25 = \boxed{79} \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Alisa and Stanley biked a total of 79 miles.**
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- **Bill's digging speed through soil:** 4 feet per hour  
- **Bill's digging speed through clay:** Half of that = 2 feet per hour  
- **Total depth to dig:**  
  - **Soil:** 24 feet  
  - **Clay:** 8 feet  

---

### **Step 1: Time to dig through soil**

$$
\text{Time}_{\text{soil}} = \frac{\text{Depth}_{\text{soil}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{soil}}} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Time to dig through clay**

$$
\text{Time}_{\text{clay}} = \frac{\text{Depth}_{\text{clay}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{clay}}} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total time**

$$
\text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{soil}} + \text{Time}_{\text{clay}} = 6 + 4 = \boxed{10 \text{ hours}}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**10 hours**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the total number of people

Howie wants to buy cupcakes for:

- **Himself**  
- **His teacher**  
- **His 25 classmates**

So, total number of people =  
$$
1 \text{ (Howie) } + 1 \text{ (teacher) } + 25 \text{ (classmates) } = 27 \text{ people}
$$

---

### Step 2: How many cupcakes does each person get?

The problem says:

> "He gets the same amount of 2 cupcakes for each himself, his teacher, and his 25 classmates."

This means **each person gets 2 cupcakes**.

So, total number of cupcakes needed =  
$$
27 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ cupcakes/person} = 54 \text{ cupcakes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{54} \text{ cupcakes}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Initial Likes
Fishio received **2000 likes** after **1 week**.

So, the **initial number of likes** = **2000**

---

### Step 2: Likes After 3 Weeks
Three weeks later (i.e., **4 weeks total** from the start), the number of likes became **70 times** the initial number.

So, total likes after 4 weeks:

$$
70 \times 2000 = 14000 \text{ likes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Recent Likes
She received **20,000 more new likes recently**.

So, we add that to the previous total:

$$
14000 + 20000 = 34000
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{34000} \text{ Instagram likes}

Let's break this down step by step to find the **difference between the final prices paid for 20 pomegranates on Tuesday and Wednesday**.

---

### **Tuesday: Clara's purchase**

- **Price per pomegranate:** $20  
- **Number of pomegranates:** 20  
- **Total before discount:**  
  $$
  20 \times 20 = 400
  $$
- **Discount:** $2 off (voucher)  
- **Final price paid:**  
  $$
  400 - 2 = 398
  $$

---

### **Wednesday: Sheila's purchase**

- **Price per pomegranate:** $30  
- **Number of pomegranates:** 20  
- **Total before discount:**  
  $$
  30 \times 20 = 600
  $$
- **Discount:** 10% off  
- **Discount amount:**  
  $$
  10\% \text{ of } 600 = 0.10 \times 600 = 60
  $$
- **Final price paid:**  
  $$
  600 - 60 = 540
  $$

---

### **Difference in final prices**

Now, we subtract the price paid on Tuesday from the price paid on Wednesday:

$$
540 - 398 = 142
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{142}
$$

So, **Sheila paid $142 more** than Clara for the same number of pomegranates.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the first month's sales**

- Sales from **red hats** = $400  
- This is **half** of the total amount she earned from selling **green hats**.

So, if red hat sales are half of green hat sales:

$$
\text{Red sales} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Green sales}
$$

$$
400 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Green sales}
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
\text{Green sales} = 800
$$

Now find **total sales in the first month**:

$$
\text{Total sales (Month 1)} = \text{Red sales} + \text{Green sales} = 400 + 800 = 1200
$$

---

### **Step 2: Use the second month information**

- In the **second month**, her sales were **3/4** of the **first month's total sales**.

$$
\text{Sales (Month 2)} = \frac{3}{4} \times 1200 = 900
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find total sales over two months**

$$
\text{Total sales (Two months)} = \text{Month 1} + \text{Month 2} = 1200 + 900 = \boxed{2100}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{2100}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total time hired**
James hires the carriage from **5 PM to 9 PM**, which is:

$$
9 \text{ PM} - 5 \text{ PM} = 4 \text{ hours}
$$

So, he rents the carriage for **4 hours**.

---

### **Step 2: Free hour**
He gets **1 hour free**. That means he only pays for:

$$
4 \text{ hours} - 1 \text{ free hour} = 3 \text{ paid hours}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Cost structure**
- The **first paid hour** costs **$15**.
- Each **hour after that** is **twice the cost** of the previous one.

So:
- 1st paid hour: $15  
- 2nd paid hour: $15 × 2 = $30  
- 3rd paid hour: $30 × 2 = $60  

---

### **Step 4: Total cost**

Add up the costs:

$$
\$15 + \$30 + \$60 = \$105
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $\boxed{\$105}$**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the information
- Sally started the week with **$200** in her bank account.
- At the end of the week, her account has **$420**.
- She received **no other money** into her account during the week.
- Her **weekly wage should be $300**.

We are asked to find out **how much was withheld from her wage**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate how much money Sally had added to her account

She ended the week with **$420**, and she started with **$200**, so:

$$
\text{Money added} = 420 - 200 = 220
$$

So, **$220** was added to her account during the week.

---

### Step 3: Determine how much she should have been paid

Her weekly wage should be **$300**, but only **$220** was added to her account.

That means:

$$
\text{Amount withheld} = \text{Expected wage} - \text{Actual amount added}
$$

$$
\text{Amount withheld} = 300 - 220 = 80
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{80}
$$

So, **$80 was withheld from Sally’s wage**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the ratio of egg to deviled egg halves**

> Lori needed **1 whole egg** to make **2 deviled egg halves**.

So,  
- 1 egg → 2 halves  
→ 1 half → ½ egg

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many deviled egg halves are needed**

Each guest eats **3 deviled egg halves**, and there are **16 guests**.

$$
\text{Total halves needed} = 16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves per guest} = 48 \text{ halves}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Convert halves to eggs**

From Step 1, we know:
- 2 halves = 1 egg  
→ 1 half = ½ egg

So,
$$
\text{Total eggs needed} = 48 \text{ halves} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ egg per half} = 24 \text{ eggs}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Convert eggs to dozens**

There are **12 eggs in a dozen**.

$$
\text{Dozens of eggs needed} = \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12} = 2 \text{ dozen}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Lori will need 2 dozen eggs.**
Shiela is required to submit a **15-page** research paper.

She has already finished **1/3** of the paper.

### Step 1: Find out how many pages she has already written.
$$
\frac{1}{3} \text{ of } 15 = \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ pages}
$$

### Step 2: Subtract the pages she has written from the total pages.
$$
15 - 5 = 10
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Shiela has **10 pages left to write**.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Total pages to read
Mike needs to read **200 pages**.

Mike plans to read **10 pages per day**.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of days needed
To find how many days it will take Mike to finish the book, divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads each day:

$$
\text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ days}
$$

### Step 4: Determine how many days before the deadline
The assignment is due in **30 days**, and Mike will finish in **20 days**. So, he will finish:

$$
30 - 20 = 10 \text{ days before the deadline}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Mike will finish his reading 10 days before the deadline.**
Let's break this down step by step to find the total cost James incurred for getting and maintaining the plane for the first year.

---

### **1. Cost of the plane:**
- The plane costs **$150,000**.

---

### **2. Monthly hanger rental:**
- James pays **$5,000 per month** to rent a hanger.

---

### **3. Monthly fuel cost:**
- He spends **twice as much as the hanger rental** on fuel.
- So, fuel cost per month = 2 × $5,000 = **$10,000**.

---

### **4. Total monthly cost (excluding the plane):**
- Hanger rental + Fuel = $5,000 + $10,000 = **$15,000 per month**

---

### **5. Annual maintenance cost (for one year):**
- There are 12 months in a year.
- Annual maintenance cost = 12 × $15,000 = **$180,000**

---

- Walnuts: $ \frac{1}{3} $ pound × $15 = $5

**Total cost of Mixture B** = $2 + $5 = **$7**

---

### Step 3: Find the difference in cost

$$
\text{Difference} = \text{Cost of Mixture A} - \text{Cost of Mixture B} = 10 - 7 = \boxed{\$3}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**It costs $3 more** for the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than for the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.
We are told that Lee has only **sheep and geese** on his farm.  
Let’s define:

- Let $ s $ be the number of **sheep**.
- Let $ g $ be the number of **geese**.

### Step 1: Use the information about heads
Each animal has **1 head**, so:
$$
s + g = 20 \tag{1}
$$

### Step 2: Use the information about legs
Sheep have **4 legs**, and geese have **2 legs**, so:
$$
4s + 2g = 70 \tag{2}
$$

### Step 3: Solve the system of equations

From equation (1), solve for $ g $:
$$
g = 20 - s
$$

Substitute into equation (2):
$$
4s + 2(20 - s) = 70
$$

Simplify:
$$
4s + 40 - 2s = 70
$$
$$
2s + 40 = 70
$$
$$
2s = 30
$$
$$
s = 15
$$

### Step 4: Find the number of geese
$$
g = 20 - s = 20 - 15 = 5
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**There are 15 sheep** on Lee's farm.

\text{Total class time} = 24 \text{ sessions} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 48 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 3: Recipes learned per hour
John learns **1 recipe every 1.5 hours**.

So, the number of recipes he learns per hour is:

$$
\frac{1 \text{ recipe}}{1.5 \text{ hours}} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ recipes per hour}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total recipes learned
Now, multiply total class time by the rate of recipes per hour:

$$
\text{Total recipes} = 48 \text{ hours} \times \frac{2}{3} \text{ recipes/hour} = \frac{96}{3} = 32 \text{ recipes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{32}
$$

John learns **32 recipes** in total.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of teachers on the court**

We are told there are **150 teachers** on the school basketball court.

---

### **Step 2: Number of history teachers**

60% of the teachers are history teachers:

$$
\text{Number of history teachers} = 60\% \times 150 = 0.60 \times 150 = 90
$$

---

### **Step 3: Number of math teachers**

The rest of the teachers are math teachers:

$$
\text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60
$$

---

### **Step 4: Time each teacher sleeps per day**

Each teacher sleeps for **6 hours a day**.

---

### **Step 5: Total time math teachers spend sleeping**

Multiply the number of math teachers by the amount of time each sleeps:

$$
\text{Total sleep time} = 60 \text{ teachers} \times 6 \text{ hours/teacher} = 360 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{360} \text{ hours}
$$

So, the **math teachers collectively spend 360 hours sleeping in one day**.
We are given the following information:

- Arelia has **$120**.
- Kassidy has **3/4 times as much money as Arelia**.
- Rayna has **$60 more than Kassidy**.
- They decide to **combine their money and share it equally among all three**.

---

### Step 1: Find how much Kassidy has

Kassidy has $ \frac{3}{4} \times 120 $

$$
\frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90
$$

So, **Kassidy has $90**.

---

### Step 2: Find how much Rayna has

Rayna has **$60 more than Kassidy**, so:

$$
90 + 60 = 150
$$

So, **Rayna has $150**.

---

### Step 3: Find the total amount of money

$$
120 \ (\text{Arelia}) + 90 \ (\text{Kassidy}) + 150 \ (\text{Rayna}) = 360
$$

Total = **$360**

---

### Step 4: Share the money equally among the three

$$
\frac{360}{3} = 120
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Each person would get **$120**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Regular game time**:  
   Sarah’s basketball game has 4 quarters, each lasting **12 minutes**.  
   So, the total regular game time is:  
   $$
   4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ minutes}
   $$

2. **Extra time due to a tie**:  
   In the last quarter, there was a tie, so the game was extended by **5 minutes**.

3. **Total game duration**:  
   Add the extra time to the regular game time:  
   $$
   48 + 5 = 53 \text{ minutes}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **53 minutes**
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Total number of employees
- There are **50 employees** in the company.

### Step 2: Number of management employees
- **20%** of the employees are management.
- So, number of management employees =  
  $$
  20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
  $$

### Step 3: Number of management employees who oversee the entire company
- Out of these 10 management employees, **30%** oversee the entire company.
- So, number of employees who oversee the company =  
  $$
  30\% \times 10 = 0.30 \times 10 = 3
  $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{3}
$$

**3 employees oversee the company.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many **tablespoons of dry ingredients** Svetlana needs to make **16 muffins**.

---

### Step 1: Identify the dry ingredients per muffin
From the problem, we are told:

- **Flour**: 5 tablespoons  
- **Sugar**: 3 tablespoons  
- **Salt**: 0.25 tablespoon  

These are all **dry ingredients**, so we can add them together to find the total amount of dry ingredients needed for **one muffin**.

$$
\text{Total dry ingredients per muffin} = 5 + 3 + 0.25 = 8.25 \text{ tablespoons}
$$

---

### Step 2: Multiply by the number of muffins
Now, multiply the total per muffin by the number of muffins (16):

$$
\text{Total dry ingredients for 16 muffins} = 8.25 \times 16
$$

Let’s do the multiplication:

$$
8.25 \times 16 = (8 + 0.25) \times 16 = (8 \times 16) + (0.25 \times 16)
$$
$$
= 128 + 4 = 132
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{132} \text{ tablespoons of dry ingredients}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Find the total amount of candy
Robert has **3 pounds**, Cindy has **5 pounds**, and Aaron has **4 pounds**.

So, the total amount of candy is:

$$
3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds}
$$

### Step 2: Divide the candy equally among the three people
There are 3 people (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron), so we divide the total candy by 3:

$$
\frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ pounds}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Each person would have **4 pounds** of candy.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the cost of type A candies**
Adam bought **7 candies** of type A, and each costs **$0.50**.

$$
\text{Cost of type A} = 7 \times 0.50 = 3.50
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the cost of type B candies**
Adam bought **10 candies** of type B, and each costs **$0.75**.

$$
\text{Cost of type B} = 10 \times 0.75 = 7.50
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the total cost**
Add the cost of type A and type B candies:

$$
\text{Total cost} = 3.50 + 7.50 = 11.00
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the change**
Adam paid **$15**, so the change he received is:

$$
\text{Change} = 15.00 - 11.00 = 4.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Adam got $4.00 in change.**
We are given the following information:

- Christina recorded her mood over **30 days**.
- She had:
  - **12 good days**
  - **8 bad days**
  - The rest were **neutral**
- Her first **8 days** were **good**
- Her next **8 days** were **bad**
- Her next **8 days** were **neutral**
- The **next 3 days** (days 25–27) were: **good, neutral, good**

We are asked: **How many good days were left in the month?**

---

### Step 1: Count the known good days

From the problem:

- First 8 days: all **good** → 8 good days
- Next 3 days (days 25–27): **good, neutral, good** → 2 more good days

So far, we have:
$$
8 \text{ (from first 8 days)} + 2 \text{ (from last 3 days)} = 10 \text{ good days}
$$

But we are told that she had a total of **12 good days** in the month.

So, the number of **remaining good days** is:
$$
12 - 10 = \boxed{2}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **2 good days left** in the month.
We are told:

- Janey has **3 more than twice** the number of books that Sally has.
- Janey has **21 books**.

Let’s define:

- Let $ S $ be the number of books Sally has.

Then, according to the problem:

$$
\text{Janey's books} = 2S + 3
$$

We know Janey has 21 books, so:

$$
2S + 3 = 21
$$

Now solve for $ S $:

1. Subtract 3 from both sides:
   $$
   2S = 21 - 3 = 18
   $$

2. Divide both sides by 2:
   $$
   S = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: Sally has **9 books**.
We are given:

- The bamboo grows **30 inches per day**.
- Today, its height is **20 feet**.
- We need to find out **in how many days** the bamboo will reach **600 inches** in height.

---

### Step 1: Convert the current height from feet to inches

Since 1 foot = 12 inches:

$$
20 \text{ feet} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ inches}
$$

So today, the bamboo is **240 inches** tall.

---

### Step 2: Find the difference between the target height and the current height

$$
600 \text{ inches} - 240 \text{ inches} = 360 \text{ inches}
$$

The bamboo needs to grow **360 inches** more to reach 600 inches.

---

### Step 3: Divide the total growth needed by the daily growth rate

$$
\frac{360 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/day}} = 12 \text{ days}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{12 \text{ days}}
$$

It will take **12 days** for the bamboo to grow from 20 feet (240 inches) to 600 inches.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out **how many toys James needs in total**.

---

### Step 1: Initial Situation

- James has **4 toys** for **4 dogs**.
- So, each dog gets **1 toy**.

---

### Step 2: More Dogs Arrive

- There are **8 more dogs**, so now there are:
  $$
  4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dogs}
  $$

- James buys **toys for these additional 8 dogs**, so he buys **8 more toys**.
- Now he has:
  $$
  4 + 8 = 12 \text{ toys}
  $$

---

### Step 3: More Dogs Arrive Again

- When James comes back, he finds that there are **twice as many dogs** as when he left.
- He left with **12 dogs**, so now there are:
  $$
  2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ dogs}
  $$

- That means **12 more dogs** have arrived (since 24 - 12 = 12).
- So James buys **12 more toys**.
- Now he has:
  $$
  12 + 12 = 24 \text{ toys}
  $$

---

### Step 4: Some Dogs Leave

- Then, **3 dogs leave**, so James no longer needs those toys.
- So he gives away or removes **3 toys**.
- Now he has:
  $$
  24 - 3 = 21 \text{ toys}
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{21} \text{ toys}
$$

James needs a total of **21 toys**.
We are given that **three people** invested a total of **$1200** in a joint savings account. The investments were made in the following order:

1. **Dylan** invested **2/5 of the total amount**.
2. **Frances** invested **2/3 of the remaining amount** after Dylan's investment.
3. **Skyler** invested the **rest**.

We need to find out how much **Skyler** invested.

---

### Step 1: Total investment
$$
\text{Total} = \$1200
$$

---

### Step 2: Dylan's investment
Dylan invested $ \frac{2}{5} $ of the total amount:

$$
\text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200 = \frac{2400}{5} = 288
$$

So, Dylan invested **\$288**.

---

### Step 3: Remaining amount after Dylan
$$
\text{Remaining after Dylan} = 1200 - 288 = 912
$$

---

### Step 4: Frances' investment
Frances invested $ \frac{2}{3} $ of the remaining amount:

$$
\text{Frances' investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 912 = \frac{1824}{3} = 608
$$

So, Frances invested **\$608**.

---

### Step 5: Remaining amount for Skyler
$$
\text{Skyler's investment} = 1200 - (\text{Dylan's} + \text{Frances'}) = 1200 - (288 + 608) = 1200 - 896 = 304
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$304}
$$

**Skyler's investment was \$304.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many signatures they have already collected.**

- Carol has **20** signatures.
- Jennifer has **44** signatures.

**Total so far:**  
$$
20 + 44 = 64 \text{ signatures}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine their goal.**

They want to have **100 signatures** in total between them by the end of summer.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how many more signatures they need to collect.**

$$
100 - 64 = 36
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
The sisters need to collect **36 more signatures** to reach their goal of 100 signatures between them.
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Lorie's hourly wage**:  
   Lorie earns **$10 per hour**.

2. **Karen's hourly wage**:  
   Karen earns **twice** what Lorie earns:  
   $$
   2 \times 10 = 20
   $$  
   So, Karen earns **$20 per hour**.

3. **How many hours does Karen work in two days?**  
   She works **3 hours per day**, so in two days:  
   $$
   3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
   $$

4. **Total earnings for Karen in two days**:  
   $$
   20 \times 6 = 120
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Karen earns $120 in two days.**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the ratio
We are told that **6 potatoes make 36 hash browns**.

So, the number of hash browns per potato is:

$$
\frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato}
$$

### Step 2: Use the rate to find the number of hash browns from 96 potatoes

Now, if each potato makes 6 hash browns, then:

$$
96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato} = 576 \text{ hash browns}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{576}
$$

You can make **576 hash browns** from 96 potatoes.
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Maximum load of the elevator**  
The elevator can support a maximum of **700 kg**.

### 2. **Weight of one adult**  
An average adult weighs **80 kg**.

### 3. **Number of people in the elevator**  
Jack is riding with **8 other adults**, so that’s a total of:  
$$
1 \text{ (Jack)} + 8 \text{ (other adults)} = 9 \text{ people}
$$

### 4. **Total weight of all people**  
Each person weighs 80 kg, so:
$$
9 \times 80 = 720 \text{ kg}
$$

### 5. **Excess weight over the limit**  
Now subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
$$
720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
They will have exceeded the maximum load by **20 kg**.
We are given the following relationships and information:

- Katarina has 5 **less** cookies than Max.
- Max has 12 **more** cookies than the Cookie Monster.
- Summer has 23 **more** cookies than Max.
- Katarina has **68** cookies.

We are asked to find the **total number of cookies** that Katarina, Max, the Cookie Monster, and Summer have altogether.

---

### Step 1: Use Katarina's cookie count to find Max's

We're told:
> Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max  
> Katarina has 68 cookies

So,
$$
\text{Max's cookies} = \text{Katarina's cookies} + 5 = 68 + 5 = 73
$$

---

### Step 2: Use Max's cookie count to find the Cookie Monster's

We're told:
> Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster

So,
$$
\text{Cookie Monster's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} - 12 = 73 - 12 = 61
$$

---

### Step 3: Use Max's cookie count to find Summer's

We're told:
> Summer has 23 more cookies than Max

So,
$$
\text{Summer's cookies} = \text{Max's cookies} + 23 = 73 + 23 = 96
$$

---

### Step 4: Add up all the cookies

Now we add up the cookies of all four people:

- Katarina: 68  
- Max: 73  
- Cookie Monster: 61  
- Summer: 96  

$$
\text{Total} = 68 + 73 + 61 + 96
$$

Let’s compute step by step:

- $68 + 73 = 141$  
- $141 + 61 = 202$  
- $202 + 96 = 298$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{298}
$$

They have a total of **298 cookies**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the original length
Let the **original length** of the dress be $ x $ cm.

---

### Step 2: Understand the changes
- Shania **extends the dress by 50% of its original length**, which means she adds $ 0.5x $ cm.
- She also **adds 20 cm** to the bottom with a lace trim.

So, the **final length** is:

$$
\text{Final length} = x + 0.5x + 20
$$

$$
\text{Final length} = 1.5x + 20
$$

We are told that the final length is **140 cm**, so:

$$
1.5x + 20 = 140
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

Subtract 20 from both sides:

$$
1.5x = 120
$$

Now divide both sides by 1.5:

$$
x = \frac{120}{1.5} = 80
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
The **original length** of the dress was **80 cm**.
We are told:

- Chris can mow the **entire** lawn in **1 hour (60 minutes)** in **turtle mode**.
- He can mow the **entire** lawn in **40 minutes** in **rabbit mode**.

Today, he mowed **half the lawn** in **turtle mode** and **half the lawn** in **rabbit mode**. We need to find how long it took him to mow the entire lawn this way.

---

### Step 1: Determine the rates of mowing

Let’s define the total area of the lawn as 1 unit.

- In **turtle mode**, he mows at a rate of:
  $$
  \frac{1 \text{ unit}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{60} \text{ units per minute}
  $$

- In **rabbit mode**, he mows at a rate of:
  $$
  \frac{1 \text{ unit}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ units per minute}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Time to mow half the lawn in each mode

He mows **half the lawn** in turtle mode and **half the lawn** in rabbit mode.

So:

- Time to mow **half the lawn** in turtle mode:
  $$
  \text{Time}_\text{turtle} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{60}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
  $$

- Time to mow **half the lawn** in rabbit mode:
  $$
  \text{Time}_\text{rabbit} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{40}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Total time

$$
\text{Total time} = 30 + 20 = \boxed{50} \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{50} \text{ minutes}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total time they have:** 30 minutes  
2. **Time to get to the corner (library):** 6 minutes  
3. **Time to get from the corner to the fire station:** 13 minutes  

So far, they have spent:  
**6 minutes + 13 minutes = 19 minutes**

Now, subtract that from the total time they have:  
**30 minutes - 19 minutes = 11 minutes**

### ✅ Final Answer: They have **11 minutes** left to get to school without being late.

---

### 2. **Bananas**
- Quantity: 2 kilos  
- Price per kilo: $2  
- Total cost for bananas = $ 2 \times 2 = \$4 $

---

### 3. **Oranges**
- Quantity: 2 kilos  
- Price per kilo: $3  
- Total cost for oranges = $ 2 \times 3 = \$6 $

---

### **Total Cost**
Add up all the costs:

$$
\$4 + \$4 + \$6 = \$14
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Catherine pays a total of \$14.**
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Greta bakes 30 cookies.**

2. **Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta:**
   $$
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ cookies}
   $$

3. **Total number of cookies baked:**
   $$
   30 + 60 = 90 \text{ cookies}
   $$

4. **They eat 10 cookies while they are cooling:**
   $$
   90 - 10 = 80 \text{ cookies}
   $$

5. **The rest are put in a box:**
   $$
   \boxed{80} \text{ cookies}
   $$

**Answer: There are 80 cookies in the box.**
We are given:

- There is **one set of twins** and **one set of triplets**.
- One **twin is 7 years older than one triplet**.
- The **combined ages** of all five children is **44 years**.

We are to find the age of **one of the twins**.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s define:

- Let $ T $ be the age of **one twin** (since they are twins, both have the same age).
- Let $ R $ be the age of **one triplet** (since they are triplets, all three have the same age).

So:
- Each twin is $ T $ years old → total for twins = $ 2T $
- Each triplet is $ R $ years old → total for triplets = $ 3R $

---

### Step 2: Use the given relationships

We are told:

> One twin is 7 years older than one triplet.

That means:

$$
T = R + 7 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
$$

Also, their **combined ages** are 44:

$$
2T + 3R = 44 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
$$

---

### Step 3: Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2

From Equation 1: $ T = R + 7 $

Substitute into Equation 2:

$$
2(R + 7) + 3R = 44
$$

Simplify:

$$
2R + 14 + 3R = 44
$$

$$
5R + 14 = 44
$$

$$
5R = 30
$$

$$
R = 6
$$

Now plug back into Equation 1 to find $ T $:

$$
T = R + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**One of the twins is 13 years old.**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate total homework time
John has the following homework:

- **Math:** 20 minutes  
- **Reading:** 40 minutes  
- **History:** 20 minutes  

Add these together:

$$
20 + 40 + 20 = 80 \text{ minutes}
$$

So, John needs **80 minutes** to finish his homework.

---

### Step 2: Convert dinner time to minutes
John has **3 hours** before dinner. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour:

$$
3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ minutes}
$$

He has **180 minutes** before dinner.

---

### Step 3: Subtract homework time from total available time
Now subtract the time he needs for homework from the total time available:

$$
180 - 80 = 100 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
John has **100 minutes** to nap.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find the cost of one candy**

We are told:

- Manolo bought **4 candies** for **$3.20**
- So, the cost of **one candy** is:

$$
\frac{3.20}{4} = 0.80
$$

So, **each candy costs $0.80**.

---

### **Step 2: Find the total cost of 10 lollipops and 10 candies**

We are given:

- Each **lollipop costs $0.40**
- Each **candy costs $0.80**

Now calculate:

- Cost of **10 lollipops**:
  $$
  10 \times 0.40 = 4.00
  $$

- Cost of **10 candies**:
  $$
  10 \times 0.80 = 8.00
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Add them together**

$$
4.00 + 8.00 = 12.00
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$12.00}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the savings rates**

- **Rong** saves **20 coins per month**.
- **Neil** saves **2/5 times more** than Rong.

So, Neil saves:

$$
20 + \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 20\right) = 20 + 8 = 28 \text{ coins per month}
$$

Alternatively, you can compute it directly as:

$$
\text{Neil's savings per month} = 20 \times \left(1 + \frac{2}{5}\right) = 20 \times \frac{7}{5} = 28 \text{ coins per month}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total savings over 10 years**

First, convert 10 years into months:

$$
10 \text{ years} = 10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ months}
$$

Now calculate how many coins each person saves in 120 months:

- **Rong's total savings**:
$$
20 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ coins}
$$

- **Neil's total savings**:
$$
28 \text{ coins/month} \times 120 \text{ months} = 3360 \text{ coins}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total coins saved by both**

$$
2400 + 3360 = \boxed{5760} \text{ coins}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{5760} \text{ coins}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the cost of the vaccines**

John’s dog needs **2 vaccines**, each costing **$20**.

$$
\text{Cost of vaccines} = 2 \times 20 = \$40
$$

---

### **Step 2: Let the total bill be $ T $

We are told that the **heartworm check is 60% of the total bill**. So:

$$
\text{Heartworm check} = 0.6T
$$

The rest of the bill (the remaining 40%) must be the cost of the vaccines, which we already calculated as **$40**.

So:

$$
0.4T = 40
$$

---

### **Step 3: Solve for $ T $**

$$
T = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100
$$

So, the **total bill is $100**.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate how much John leaves with**

John brought **$125** with him and spent **$100** at the vet.

$$
\text{Amount left} = 125 - 100 = \$25
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**John leaves with $25.**
Let's break this down step by step to find the total price of one crate of fruit.

We are given:

- **Apple** costs **$0.50**
- **Banana** costs **twice as much as an apple**
- **Orange** costs **three times as much as a banana**

Let’s calculate each:

#### **Banana:**
- Banana = 2 × Apple
- Apple = $0.50
- So, Banana = 2 × $0.50 = **$1.00**

#### **Orange:**
- Orange = 3 × Banana
- Banana = $1.00
- So, Orange = 3 × $1.00 = **$3.00**

---

### **Step 2: Count the number of each fruit in a crate**

From the problem:

- 5 bananas
- 12 apples
- 7 oranges

---

- 12 apples × $0.50 = **$6.00**

#### **Oranges:**
- 7 oranges × $3.00 = **$21.00**

---

### **Step 4: Add up all the costs**

$$
\text{Total Price} = \$5.00 + \$6.00 + \$21.00 = \boxed{\$32.00}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
The price for one crate of fruit is **\$32.00**.
We are told that Brittany's comforter is made up of **1-foot by 1-foot squares**, so the total number of squares equals the total **square feet** of the comforter.

Let's break the problem down step by step to find out how much money the group spent on drinks and snacks.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the total number of people**

- Aiden and **12 friends** = 1 + 12 = **13 people**
- They meet up with **7 more friends** = 13 + 7 = **20 people total**

So, there are **20 people** in the group.

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many drinks and snacks are needed**

Each seat has:
- **1 person**
- **2 drinks**
- **3 snacks**

So for each person, they need:
- 2 drinks
- 3 snacks

Total drinks needed = 20 people × 2 drinks/person = **40 drinks**

Total snacks needed = 20 people × 3 snacks/person = **60 snacks**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the cost**

Each drink and snack costs **$2**.

So:

- Cost of drinks = 40 drinks × $2 = **$80**
- Cost of snacks = 60 snacks × $2 = **$120**

---

### **Step 4: Total cost**

Total cost = Cost of drinks + Cost of snacks  
= $80 + $120 = **$200**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**$200** is the total amount the group spent on drinks and snacks.
We are given the following information:

1. **Gissela's truck** can haul **4,000 pounds** of gravel.
2. **Gordy's truck** can haul **800 pounds more** than Gissela's truck.
3. When **Gary joins**, the **three trucks together** can haul **11,600 pounds**.

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find Gordy's truck capacity

Gordy's truck can haul **800 pounds more** than Gissela's:

$$
\text{Gordy's capacity} = 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 2: Let Gary's truck capacity be $ x $

So, we have:
- Gissela: 4,000 pounds
- Gordy: 4,800 pounds
- Gary: $ x $ pounds

According to the problem, **all three together can haul 11,600 pounds**:

$$
4,000 + 4,800 + x = 11,600
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

$$
(4,000 + 4,800) + x = 11,600 \\
8,800 + x = 11,600 \\
x = 11,600 - 8,800 \\
x = 2,800
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.**
We are told:

- There are **8 males**, including **Larry**.
- There are **6 females**.
- Each **male ate 1 more dumpling than each female**.
- Each **female ate 3 dumplings**.
- There were **no leftovers**.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many dumplings each male ate

Each female ate 3 dumplings.  
Since each male ate **1 more** than each female, then:

$$
\text{Dumplings per male} = 3 + 1 = 4
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate total number of dumplings eaten by all people

- Total number of **males** = 8  
- Total number of **females** = 6  

So,

- Total dumplings eaten by **males**:  
  $$
  8 \times 4 = 32
  $$

- Total dumplings eaten by **females**:  
  $$
  6 \times 3 = 18
  $$

- Total dumplings eaten by everyone:  
  $$
  32 + 18 = 50
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{50}
$$

Larry cooked **50 dumplings**.
Let's solve this step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the ratio**
Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio **3:2**.

This means:
- Gerald gets **3 parts**
- Julia gets **2 parts**
- Total parts = 3 + 2 = **5 parts**

---

### **Step 2: Find the value of one part**
Total amount = $100  
Number of parts = 5  
So, each part = $100 ÷ 5 = **$20**

---

### **Step 3: Find how much Gerald got**
Gerald's share = 3 parts × $20 = **$60**

---

### **Step 4: Subtract the amount Gerald spent**
Gerald spent $10 on a book.  
Money left = $60 - $10 = **$50**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**$50** is left with Gerald.
We are told:

- Martha's **cat** is **5 times faster** than her **turtle**.
- The **cat runs at 15 feet per second**.
- We need to find how many **feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds**.

---

### Step 1: Find the turtle's speed

If the cat is **5 times faster** than the turtle, that means the **turtle's speed is 1/5 of the cat's speed**.

$$
\text{Turtle's speed} = \frac{\text{Cat's speed}}{5} = \frac{15}{5} = 3 \text{ feet per second}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate distance the turtle crawls in 40 seconds

Now we use the formula:

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
$$

$$
\text{Distance} = 3 \, \text{feet/sec} \times 40 \, \text{sec} = 120 \, \text{feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{120} \text{ feet}

$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how much more money is needed to reach the goal

$$
\text{Remaining amount} = 6300 - 2100 = 4200 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate how many more hours are needed to raise the remaining amount

$$
\text{Additional hours} = \frac{4200}{700} = 6 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add the initial 3 hours to find the total time

$$
\text{Total hours} = 3 + 6 = 9 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{9} \text{ hours}

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total water from the Colorado River**: Let’s assume the total amount of water from the river is 100% (for simplicity).

2. **Water used by Colorado City**:  
   The city uses **40%** of the river's total water.

3. **Water used for industrial purposes**:  
   Of that 40%, **80%** is used for **industrial** purposes.  
   So, the amount used for industry =  
   $$
   40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32 = 32\%
   $$

4. **Water used for non-industrial purposes**:  
   That means the remaining portion of the 40% used by the city is for **non-industrial** purposes.  
   $$
   40\% - 32\% = 8\%
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.**

Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Understand the deal:**
- **Buy 2 scoops, get 1 free**  
This means for every **3 scoops**, Erin only pays for **2 scoops**.

### 2. **Cost per scoop:**
- Each scoop costs **$1.50**

### 3. **How much money does Erin have?**
- Erin has **$6.00**

### 4. **Determine how many sets of 3 scoops she can buy with $6.00:**

Since she pays **$1.50 × 2 = $3.00** for 3 scoops (because she gets 1 free), we divide her total money by the cost of a set of 3 scoops:

$$
\frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \text{ sets}
$$

So, she can buy **2 sets of 3 scoops**, which is:

$$
2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Erin should buy 6 scoops of ice cream.**

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **This week:**
   - Castle bought **3 boxes of Coco Crunch**.
   - Castle also bought **5 boxes of Fruit Loops**.
   - So, total cereal boxes bought this week =  
     $ 3 + 5 = 8 $ boxes.

2. **Last week:**
   - Castle bought **4 boxes of cereal**.

3. **Difference:**
   - To find how many more boxes she bought this week than last week, subtract last week’s total from this week’s total:
     $ 8 - 4 = 4 $.

### ✅ Final Answer: **4 more boxes**.
We are given the following information:

- **Helga's tap rates**:
  - When her arms are **down**, she taps:
    - Right foot: **300 taps per minute**
    - Left foot: **250 taps per minute**
  - When her arms are **up**, both feet tap at **200 taps per minute**

- She dances for a total of **5 minutes**.
- Her **arms are raised for 2 minutes**, and **not raised for 3 minutes**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate taps when arms are down (3 minutes)

During these 3 minutes, her right and left feet tap at 300 and 250 taps per minute respectively.

So, the number of taps from each foot in 3 minutes is:

- **Right foot**:  
  $ 3 \text{ min} \times 300 \text{ taps/min} = 900 \text{ taps} $

- **Left foot**:  
  $ 3 \text{ min} \times 250 \text{ taps/min} = 750 \text{ taps} $

- **Total taps during arms-down time**:  
  $ 900 + 750 = 1650 \text{ taps} $

---

### Step 2: Calculate taps when arms are up (2 minutes)

When arms are up, **both feet tap at 200 taps per minute**.

So, total taps per minute = $ 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ taps/min} $

For 2 minutes:

- **Total taps during arms-up time**:  
  $ 2 \text{ min} \times 400 \text{ taps/min} = 800 \text{ taps} $

---

### Step 3: Add both times

- Taps with arms down: **1650**
- Taps with arms up: **800**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{1650 + 800 = 2450}
$$

**The combined total number of taps is 2450.**
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole himself.

---

### **1. Cost of not fixing the pothole:**
If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, it will cause **$450 worth of damage** to his car.

---

### **2. Cost of fixing the pothole:**

Ron will have to pay a **$120 fine** for unauthorized road maintenance.

He also needs to buy **3 buckets of asphalt**, each costing **$25**.

So, cost of asphalt =  
$$
3 \times 25 = 75
$$

Total cost of fixing the pothole =  
$$
120 + 75 = 195
$$

---

### **3. How much does he save?**

If he fixes the pothole, he avoids the **$450 car damage** but spends **$195** on fixing it.

So, the savings are:
$$
450 - 195 = 255
$$

---

### ✅ **Answer: Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.**

### Step 1: Total number of chairs initially
- Normal chairs = 170  
- Baby chairs = 23  
- **Total chairs** = 170 + 23 = **193**

### Step 2: Number of chairs sent to the carpenter
- Normal chairs sent = 20  
- Baby chairs sent = 13  
- **Total chairs sent** = 20 + 13 = **33**

### Step 3: Subtract the chairs sent from the total
- Chairs left = Total chairs - Chairs sent  
- Chairs left = 193 - 33 = **160**

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The restaurant has 160 chairs left.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of people**
- Bryce + 4 friends = **5 people**

Each person ordered **one pizza**, and each pizza has **12 slices**.

So, total number of pizzas = **5 pizzas**

Total number of slices =  
$$
5 \text{ pizzas} \times 12 \text{ slices per pizza} = 60 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### **Step 2: How many slices were eaten by Bryce and two friends**

- **Bryce and 2 friends** = 3 people  
- Each ate **2/3** of their pizza

Each pizza has 12 slices, so:
$$
\frac{2}{3} \times 12 = 8 \text{ slices per person}
$$

So, for 3 people:
$$
3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ slices eaten}
$$

---

### **Step 3: How many slices were eaten by the other two friends**

- The remaining 2 friends ate **¾** of their pizzas

Again, each pizza has 12 slices:
$$
\frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9 \text{ slices per person}
$$

So, for 2 people:
$$
2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ slices eaten}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total slices eaten**

$$
24 \text{ (from first group)} + 18 \text{ (from second group)} = 42 \text{ slices eaten}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Slices left**

$$
60 \text{ total slices} - 42 \text{ slices eaten} = \boxed{18} \text{ slices left}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{18} \text{ slices of pizza were left}
$$
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the rate of eating for the cat**

- The **cat eats 9 sausages in 30 minutes**.
- So, the **rate of the cat** is:

$$
\text{Rate}_{\text{cat}} = \frac{9 \text{ sausages}}{30 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{3}{10} \text{ sausages per minute}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find how long the dog takes to eat 9 sausages**

- The **dog can eat the same number of sausages (9)** in **2/3 the time** the cat takes.
- The cat takes **30 minutes**, so the dog takes:

$$
\text{Time}_{\text{dog}} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 = 20 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the average time**

We are asked to find the **average time** it takes for **both the cat and the dog** to eat 9 sausages.

So we take the average of their times:

$$
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time}_{\text{cat}} + \text{Time}_{\text{dog}}}{2} = \frac{30 + 20}{2} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{25 \text{ minutes}}
$$
We are given the following information:

- The **length of Topher’s shoe** is **8 feet 4 inches**.
- The **length of Topher’s shoe** is **10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby’s shoe**.

We are to find the **length of Bobby’s shoe**, in **inches**.

---

### Step 1: Convert Topher’s shoe length to inches

Topher’s shoe is **8 feet 4 inches**.

Since **1 foot = 12 inches**, we convert:

$$
8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}
$$

So, Topher’s shoe is:

$$
96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 2: Set up the equation

Let $ x $ be the length of **Bobby’s shoe** (in inches).

According to the problem:

$$
\text{Topher's shoe} = 9 \times (\text{Bobby's shoe}) + 10
$$

Substitute the known value for Topher’s shoe:

$$
100 = 9x + 10
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

$$
100 - 10 = 9x \\
90 = 9x \\
x = \frac{90}{9} = 10
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{10} \text{ inches}
$$

So, **one of Bobby’s shoes is 10 inches long.**
Let's break this down step by step.

- There are **32 teachers' cars**, and each car has **2 windows**.

So, calculate the total number of windows for both students and teachers:

#### **Students' cars:**
$$
64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows per car} = 256 \text{ windows}
$$

#### **Teachers' cars:**
$$
32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows per car} = 64 \text{ windows}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many windows Hannah smashes**

Hannah smashes:
- **A quarter (1/4)** of the **students' windows**
- **Three-quarters (3/4)** of the **teachers' windows**

#### **Students' windows smashed:**
$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 256 = 64 \text{ windows}
$$

#### **Teachers' windows smashed:**
$$
\frac{3}{4} \times 64 = 48 \text{ windows}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add them together**

$$
64 + 48 = 112 \text{ windows}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{112}
$$

Hannah smashes **112 windows** in total.

Candy has:

- **15** light blue spools  
- **45** dark blue spools  
- **40** light green spools  
- **50** dark green spools  

Add them all together:

$$
15 + 45 + 40 + 50 = 150 \text{ spools}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the number of blue spools**

Blue spools include both **light blue** and **dark blue**:

$$
15 + 45 = 60 \text{ blue spools}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the percentage of blue spools**

Use the formula for percentage:

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of blue spools}}{\text{Total number of spools}} \right) \times 100
$$

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100 = 0.4 \times 100 = 40\%
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{40\%}
$$

So, **40%** of Candy's spools are blue.
We are given the following:

- **Total number of people**: 5000  
- **By midday (12:00)**, **2/5** of the people had voted.  
- **By 16:00 (4:00 PM)**, **2/3 of the remaining people** had voted.

We are asked to find the number of people who **had not voted by 16:00**.

---

### Step 1: Number of people who voted by midday

$$
\frac{2}{5} \times 5000 = 2000
$$

So, **2000 people** had voted by midday.

---

### Step 2: Number of people remaining after midday

$$
5000 - 2000 = 3000
$$

So, **3000 people** were still waiting to vote after midday.

---

### Step 3: Number of people who voted between midday and 16:00

$$
\frac{2}{3} \times 3000 = 2000
$$

So, **2000 more people** voted between midday and 16:00.

---

### Step 4: Total number of people who had voted by 16:00

$$
2000 \text{ (by midday)} + 2000 \text{ (between midday and 16:00)} = 4000
$$

---

### Step 5: Number of people who had **not** voted by 16:00

$$
5000 - 4000 = \boxed{1000}
$$

---

### Step 1: Find the number of students in each class

Since there are two classes and a total of 80 students, and each class has the same number of students:

$$
\text{Number of students in each class} = \frac{80}{2} = 40
$$

So, each class has **40 students**.

---

### Step 2: Find the number of girls in each class

In each class, **40%** of the students are girls. So:

$$
\text{Number of girls in each class} = 40\% \times 40 = 0.4 \times 40 = 16
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the number of boys in each class

Since each class has 40 students and 16 are girls, the rest are boys:

$$
\text{Number of boys in each class} = 40 - 16 = 24
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{24}
$$

There are **24 boys in each class**.
Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of slices on the plate:**  
   There are **2 slices** on the plate.

2. **Mara added 3 slices:**  
   $ 2 + 3 = 5 $ slices on the plate now.

3. **She tripled the number of slices she currently has:**  
   $ 5 \times 3 = 15 $ slices on the plate now.

4. **She ate 2 slices:**  
   $ 15 - 2 = 13 $ slices left.

5. **Her friend stole 5 slices:**  
   $ 13 - 5 = 8 $ slices remaining.

### ✅ Final Answer: **8 slices** remained on the plate.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Count the total number of animals
Melissa has to groom different types of animals:

- **Dogs:** 8  
- **Cats:** 5  
- **Birds:** 3  
- **Horses:** 12  

**Total animals = 8 + 5 + 3 + 12 = 28**

---

### Step 2: Split the jobs evenly over the days of the week

There are **7 days in a week**, and she wants to split the **28 animals** evenly.

So, divide the total number of animals by the number of days:

$$
\frac{28}{7} = 4
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Melissa will groom 4 animals each day.**
Let's break down the problem step by step to find **Mark's profit**.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate total cost**
Mark buys **3 packs**, each costing **$1800**.

$$
\text{Total cost} = 3 \times 1800 = \$5400
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total value of cards he received**

He gets:

- **1 card worth $4000**
- **1 card worth $1000**
- **30 more cards, each worth an average of $50**

So, calculate the total value:

$$
\text{Value of special cards} = 4000 + 1000 = \$5000
$$

$$
\text{Value of remaining 30 cards} = 30 \times 50 = \$1500
$$

$$
\text{Total value of all cards} = 5000 + 1500 = \$6500
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate profit**

Profit is calculated as:

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Total value of cards} - \text{Total cost}
$$

$$
\text{Profit} = 6500 - 5400 = \$1100
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$1100}
$$

Mark made a **profit of $1100**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost at the **first amusement park**

- Cost per adult = $26  
- Cost per child = $12  
- Number of adults = 2  
- Number of children = 2  

**Total cost at first park**  
= (Cost per adult × number of adults) + (Cost per child × number of children)  
= (26 × 2) + (12 × 2)  
= 52 + 24  
= **$76**

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost at the **second amusement park**

- Cost per adult = $14  
- Cost per child = $10  
- Number of adults = 2  
- Number of children = 2  

**Total cost at second park**  
= (14 × 2) + (10 × 2)  
= 28 + 20  
= **$48**

---

### Step 3: Calculate the savings

**Savings** = Cost at first park − Cost at second park  
= $76 − $48  
= **$28**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jake's family will save $28 by choosing the second amusement park.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much the tomato vendor saves in a week.

---

### **Step 1: Determine daily cost difference**

- **Old price per tomato:** $0.50  
- **New price per tomato:** $0.40  
- **Cost savings per tomato:**  
  $$
  0.50 - 0.40 = 0.10 \text{ dollars per tomato}
  $$

- **Number of tomatoes sold per day:** 500  
- **Daily savings:**  
  $$
  500 \times 0.10 = 50 \text{ dollars per day}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate weekly savings**

- **Number of days in a week:** 7  
- **Weekly savings:**  
  $$
  50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{350} \text{ dollars}
$$

The tomato vendor saves **$350 per week** by switching vendors.
We are given:

- Sean has **56 marbles**.
- Carl has **four times as many marbles as Sean**.
- Sean has **half as many marbles as Cal**.

---

### Step 1: Find how many marbles Carl has

Carl has **4 times** as many marbles as Sean.

$$
\text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 4 \times 56 = 224
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many marbles Cal has

Sean has **half as many** marbles as Cal, so:

$$
\text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles}
$$

So,

$$
\text{Cal's marbles} = 2 \times \text{Sean's marbles} = 2 \times 56 = 112
$$

---

### Step 3: Add Carl's and Cal's marbles together

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles} = 224 + 112 = 336
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{336}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the initial setup
- There are **54 students**.
- They are to be separated into **6 groups of equal size**.

So, first, we can find how many students are in each group:

$$
\frac{54}{6} = 9 \text{ students per group}
$$

### Step 2: Determine how many groups are needed for the activity
The activity requires **12 groups**.

So, we need to form **12 groups**, with each group having **9 students** (since the groups are of equal size).

Now, let's check if there are enough students to make 12 groups of 9:

$$
12 \times 9 = 108 \text{ students}
$$

But we only have **54 students**. So, we don't have enough students to form 12 groups of 9.

### Step 3: Find how many more groups can be formed
We want to know how many **more groups** can be formed from the 54 students, assuming each group must have **equal size**.

Since the original grouping was into **6 groups of 9**, and we still have **54 students**, we can form:

$$
\frac{54}{9} = 6 \text{ groups}
$$

So, the maximum number of groups that can be formed is **6**, which is already given.

### Step 4: Answer the question
> "How many more groups are needed to form?"

This wording is a bit ambiguous, but it likely means:

> "If the activity requires 12 groups, how many more groups are needed beyond what can be formed from the 54 students?"

Since we can only form **6 groups** from the 54 students, and the activity requires **12 groups**, then:

$$
12 - 6 = \boxed{6}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{6}
$$

**6 more groups are needed to form.**
Let's break this down step by step to find the total number of chairs Candy will rent out in **two 4-week months**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the time frame

We are told:

- There are **two 4-week months**, so that’s:
  $$
  2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ weeks}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many weekdays and weekends there are in a week

In a typical week:

- **5 weekdays** (Monday to Friday)
- **2 weekend days** (Saturday and Sunday)

So, per week:

- **Chairs rented on weekdays**:  
  $$
  5 \text{ days} \times 60 \text{ chairs/day} = 300 \text{ chairs}
  $$
- **Chairs rented on weekends**:  
  $$
  2 \text{ days} \times 100 \text{ chairs/day} = 200 \text{ chairs}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Total chairs per week

$$
300 \text{ (weekdays)} + 200 \text{ (weekends)} = 500 \text{ chairs/week}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total chairs for 8 weeks

$$
8 \text{ weeks} \times 500 \text{ chairs/week} = 4000 \text{ chairs}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{4000}
$$

Candy will be able to rent out **4000 chairs** in two 4-week months.
Let's solve this step by step:

---

### **Initial number of bananas:**
Gunther had **48** bananas.

---

### **Day 1: Arnold steals half the bananas**

Arnold stole **half** of the bananas:
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \text{ bananas}
$$

So, after Arnold steals, Gunther has:
$$
48 - 24 = 24 \text{ bananas left}
$$

---

### **Day 2: Gunther adds 25 bananas**

Gunther adds **25** bananas to the pile:
$$
24 + 25 = 49 \text{ bananas}
$$

Then, Arnold steals **12** more bananas:
$$
49 - 12 = 37 \text{ bananas}
$$

---

### **Day 3: Gunther adds 6 more bananas**

Gunther adds **6** bananas to the pile:
$$
37 + 6 = 43 \text{ bananas}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{43} \text{ bananas}
$$

Gunther found **43 bananas** in the pile.
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Number of roommates**  
Jenna has **4 roommates**, so including Jenna, there are:  
**4 + 1 = 5 people** in total.

---

### 2. **Monthly electricity cost**  
The electricity bill is **$100 per month**.

---

### 3. **Total yearly cost**  
There are **12 months in a year**, so the total annual cost is:  
$$
\$100 \times 12 = \$1,200
$$

---

### 4. **Divide the cost equally among 5 roommates**  
Now divide the total annual cost by the number of roommates:  
$$
\frac{\$1,200}{5} = \$240
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many glasses Jeff sent
Jeff sent **8 dozen glasses**.  
Since 1 dozen = 12 items:

$$
8 \text{ dozen} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many plates Jeff sent
Jeff sent **4 dozen plates**:

$$
4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates}
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine how many glasses and plates were broken
- **10 glasses** were broken  
- **6 plates** were broken

---

### Step 4: Calculate how many glasses and plates are left
- Glasses remaining:  
$$
96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses}
$$

- Plates remaining:  
$$
48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates}
$$

---

### Step 5: Total number of glasses and plates Jeff has now
$$
86 + 42 = 128
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jeff has 128 glasses and plates now.**
Let's break this down **step by step** to find out how many buttons Lorraine has at the end.

---

### Step 1: Initial Stickers
Lorraine starts with:
- **30 small stickers**
- **40 large stickers**

---

### Step 2: Trade 90% of Small Stickers for Large Buttons

Each **small sticker is worth 1 small button**, but we are trading them **for large buttons**.  
We need to clarify the exchange rate between **small stickers and large buttons**.

From the problem:

> "A large button is worth three small stickers."

So, **1 large button = 3 small stickers**  
→ So, **1 small sticker = 1/3 of a large button**

So, if she trades **90% of her small stickers** for large buttons, that’s:

- 90% of 30 small stickers = $0.9 \times 30 = 27$ small stickers  
- Each small sticker = $ \frac{1}{3} $ large button  
- So, 27 small stickers = $27 \times \frac{1}{3} = 9$ large buttons

✅ **After this trade**, Lorraine now has:
- **Small stickers left**: $30 - 27 = 3$
- **Large stickers**: still 40
- **Large buttons gained**: 9

---

### Step 3: Trade 50% of Large Stickers for Large Buttons

She has **40 large stickers** and trades **50%** of them for **large buttons**.

- 50% of 40 = $0.5 \times 40 = 20$ large stickers  
- Each large sticker is worth **1 large button** (since it's traded directly for a large button)

✅ **After this trade**, Lorraine now has:
- **Large stickers left**: $40 - 20 = 20$
- **Large buttons gained**: 20
- **Total large buttons so far**: $9 + 20 = 29$

---

### Step 4: Trade the rest of the large stickers for small buttons

Now she has **20 large stickers left**. She trades all of them for **small buttons**.

From the problem:
> "Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons."

So, **1 large sticker = 3 small buttons**

✅ **After this trade**, Lorraine now has:
- **Small buttons from large stickers**: $20 \times 3 = 60$
- **Total small buttons so far**: 60
- **Small stickers left**: 3 (from earlier)
- **Total small buttons from small stickers**: 3

✅ **Total small buttons**: $60 + 3 = 63$

---

### Step 5: Total Buttons

Now add up all the buttons:

- **Large buttons**: 29
- **Small buttons**: 63

✅ **Total buttons = 29 + 63 = 92**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Lorraine has 92 buttons by the end.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Monday**: Joey played **2 matches**.
2. **Friday**: Joey played **1 match**.
3. **Saturday**: He played **double the number of matches he played on Monday**.

So, for Saturday:
- Double of Monday’s matches = 2 × 2 = **4 matches**.

Now, let's add them all up:

- Monday: 2 matches  
- Friday: 1 match  
- Saturday: 4 matches  

**Total matches in one week** = 2 + 1 + 4 = **7 matches**

✅ **Answer: 7 matches**.
We are given the following information:

- There are **33 people** on the council.
- The vote passed with **twice as many votes in favor** as there were **against**.

Let’s define the variables:

Let:
- $ x $ = number of votes **against** the regulation
- Then, the number of votes **in favor** is $ 2x $

The total number of votes is the sum of the votes in favor and against:

$$
x + 2x = 33
$$

$$
3x = 33
$$

$$
x = 11
$$

So, the number of votes **in favor** is:

$$
2x = 2 \times 11 = 22
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **22 votes in favor**.
Let's solve this step by step.

We are told:

- **11 students** need size **extra-small**.
- **Twice as many students** need size **small** as extra-small.
- **Four less than the number of size small students** need size **medium**.
- **Half as many students** need size **large** as size **medium**.
- **Six more students** need size **extra-large** than large.

Let’s define the number of students for each size:

---

### Step 1: Extra-Small (XS)
Given:  
$$
\text{XS} = 11
$$

---

### Step 2: Small (S)
Twice as many as XS:  
$$
\text{S} = 2 \times \text{XS} = 2 \times 11 = 22
$$

---

### Step 3: Medium (M)
Four less than S:  
$$
\text{M} = \text{S} - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18
$$

---

### Step 4: Large (L)
Half as many as M:  
$$
\text{L} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{M} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
$$

---

### Step 5: Extra-Large (XL)
Six more than L:  
$$
\text{XL} = \text{L} + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15
$$

---

### Step 6: Total Shirts Ordered

Now, add up all the sizes:

$$
\text{Total} = \text{XS} + \text{S} + \text{M} + \text{L} + \text{XL}
$$
$$
= 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15 = 75
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{75}
$$ shirts in total.
Sure! Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the discount

### Step 2: Calculate the discount amount
To find the discount amount, multiply the marked price by the discount rate:

$$
\text{Discount} = 140 \times 0.05 = 7
$$

So, the discount is **$7**.

### Step 3: Subtract the discount from the original price
$$
\text{Final price} = 140 - 7 = 133
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
You will pay **$133** after the 5% discount.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Number of songs in one playlist
- Each playlist has **300 songs**.

### Step 2: Total number of songs in 20 playlists
- John has **20 playlists**, so total number of songs is:
  
  $$
  20 \times 300 = 6000 \text{ songs}
  $$

### Step 3: Length of each song
- Each song is **10 hours long**.

### Step 4: Total duration of all songs
- Multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song:

  $$
  6000 \times 10 = 60,000 \text{ hours}
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{60,000} \text{ hours}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of people
We are told there are **50 people** in total.

---

### Step 2: People who think horse #2 will win

- **20%** of the 50 people think horse #2 will win.
- So,  
  $$
  0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ people}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Remaining people after those who think horse #2 will win

$$
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ people remaining}
$$

---

### Step 4: People who think horse #7 will win

- **60%** of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win.
- So,  
  $$
  0.60 \times 40 = 24 \text{ people}
  $$

---

### Step 5: Remaining people (those who think horse #12 will win)

Now subtract the people who think horse #2 or horse #7 will win from the total:

$$
50 - 10 - 24 = 16 \text{ people}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{16} \text{ people think horse #12 will win.}
$$
We are given the following information:

- Two thirds of Jana's puppies are **Pomeranians**.
- One third of the **Pomeranians** are **girls**.
- There are **6 Pomeranian girls**.

We are asked to find: **How many puppies does Jana have?**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define the total number of puppies as $ x $.

So, total puppies = $ x $

### Step 2: Two-thirds of the puppies are Pomeranians.

$$
\text{Number of Pomeranians} = \frac{2}{3}x
$$

### Step 3: One-third of the Pomeranians are girls.

$$
\text{Number of Pomeranian girls} = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{2}{3}x = \frac{2}{9}x
$$

We're told that there are **6 Pomeranian girls**, so:

$$
\frac{2}{9}x = 6
$$

### Step 4: Solve for $ x $

Multiply both sides by 9:

$$
2x = 54
$$

Divide both sides by 2:

$$
x = 27
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Jana has 27 puppies.**
Let's break the problem down step by step:

1. **Jayden's money from selling pictures:**  
   Jayden has **$70**.

2. **Ava's contribution:**  
   Ava gives Jayden **half of her $90 allowance**.  
   Half of $90 is:  
   $$
   \frac{90}{2} = 45
   $$  
   So, Ava gives Jayden **$45**.

3. **Total money Jayden has now:**  
   Jayden’s money + Ava’s contribution:  
   $$
   70 + 45 = 115
   $$

4. **Cost of the camera:**  
   The camera costs **$200**.

5. **How much more does Jayden need?**  
   Subtract the amount he has from the cost of the camera:  
   $$
   200 - 115 = 85
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.**
We are given:

- There are **three homes**.
- The total number of **cases of shingles** needed is **250**.
- The **first house needs half of what the second house needs**.
- The **third house needs double what the first house needs**.

Let’s define variables to represent the number of cases each house needs:

Let:
- $ x $ = number of cases for the **first house**
- $ y $ = number of cases for the **second house**
- $ z $ = number of cases for the **third house**

From the problem, we know:

1. $ x + y + z = 250 $ (total cases)
2. $ x = \frac{1}{2}y $ (first house needs half of the second)
3. $ z = 2x $ (third house needs double the first)

### Step 1: Substitute equations into the total

From equation (2):  
$ x = \frac{1}{2}y $ → $ y = 2x $

From equation (3):  
$ z = 2x $

Now substitute into equation (1):

$$
x + y + z = 250 \\
x + 2x + 2x = 250 \\
5x = 250
$$

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = \frac{250}{5} = 50
$$

### Step 3: Find the number of cases for the third house

$$
z = 2x = 2 \times 50 = \boxed{100}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The third house will need 100 cases of shingles.**

We are told:

- George has **45% more pears than bananas**.
- George has **200 bananas**.

### Step 1: Find the number of pears

If George has **45% more pears than bananas**, then:

$$
\text{Number of pears} = \text{Number of bananas} + 45\% \text{ of number of bananas}
$$

$$
= 200 + (0.45 \times 200)
$$

$$
= 200 + 90 = 290
$$

So, George has **290 pears**.

---

### Step 2: Find the total number of fruits

$$
\text{Total fruits} = \text{Number of bananas} + \text{Number of pears}
$$

$$
= 200 + 290 = 490
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{490}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how much money Marissa had initially
Marissa had **$80**.

$$

So, Marissa has **$60 left** to buy candy bars for her brother Jimmy.

### Step 3: Determine the price of each candy bar
Each candy bar costs **$5**.

### Step 4: Calculate how many candy bars she can buy with $60
To find out how many candy bars she can buy, divide the remaining money by the price per candy bar:

$$
\frac{60}{5} = 12
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Marissa bought **12 candy bars** for Jimmy.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Juice needed**: Sam wants to make **4 liters** of juice.

2. **Oranges needed per liter**: To make **1 liter** of juice, Sam needs **5 kilograms** of oranges.

   So, for **4 liters**, he will need:
   $$
   4 \text{ liters} \times 5 \text{ kg/liter} = 20 \text{ kg of oranges}
   $$

3. **Cost per kilogram**: Each kilogram of oranges costs **$3**.

   So, the total cost is:
   $$
   20 \text{ kg} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kg} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$60**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many books Ahmed read

We are told:

> "In one hour, Ezra read **twice as many books as Ahmed**."

Also:

> "Ezra has read **300 books this hour**."

So if Ezra read **300 books**, and that is **twice** what Ahmed read, then:

$$
\text{Ahmed's books} = \frac{300}{2} = 150
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many books Ezra will read in total

Ezra has already read **300 books**, and he **decided to read 150 more**. So:

$$
\text{Ezra's total books} = 300 + 150 = 450
$$

---

### Step 3: Add the books read by both Ezra and Ahmed

- Ezra: 450 books  
- Ahmed: 150 books  

$$
\text{Total books read altogether} = 450 + 150 = \boxed{600}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{600}
$$
Let's break down Tanya's earnings step by step for each day.

---

### **Monday:**
- She teaches **4 classes**.
- She teaches for **5 hours**.
- Since she teaches **more than 3 classes**, she gets an **additional $5 per day**.

#### Earnings:
- Hourly rate: $15/hour × 5 hours = **$75**
- Additional daily bonus: **$5**

**Total for Monday = $75 + $5 = $80**

---

### **Wednesday:**
- She teaches **2 classes**.
- She teaches for **2 hours**.
- Since she teaches **2 classes**, which is **not more than 3**, she **does not get the additional $5 per day**.

#### Earnings:
- Hourly rate: $15/hour × 2 hours = **$30**

**Total for Wednesday = $30**

---

### **Total Earnings for Both Days:**
- Monday: $80  
- Wednesday: $30  

**Total = $80 + $30 = $110**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$110**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- The company has:
  - **4 vanilla scents**
  - **8 fruity scents**

- By the end of the day, they sold:
  - **5 of each vanilla scent** → So total vanilla scents sold = $ 4 \times 5 = 20 $
  - **2 of each fruity scent** → So total fruity scents sold = $ 8 \times 2 = 16 $

### Step 2: Find how many more vanilla scents were sold compared to fruity scents

$$
\text{Difference} = \text{Vanilla sold} - \text{Fruity sold} = 20 - 16 = 4
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**4 more vanilla scents were sold compared with fruity scents.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the money Bennet gets from selling eggplants.
He sells **20 eggplants** at **$3 each**:

$$
20 \times 3 = 60
$$

So, he makes **$60** from the eggplants.

---

### Step 2: Determine how much more money he needs to reach $135.
He wants a total of **$135**, and he already has **$60** from the eggplants:

$$
135 - 60 = 75
$$

So, he needs **$75** more from selling corn.

---

### Step 3: Find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for.
He has **25 ears of corn** to sell, and he needs to make **$75** from them. So, divide the total amount needed by the number of ears:

$$
\frac{75}{25} = 3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Bennet should sell each ear of corn for **$3**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total Time Available**
Tatiana has:
- **Saturday:** 7 hours  
- **Sunday:** 5 hours  
- **Total weekend time = 7 + 5 = 12 hours**

---

### **Step 2: Time Spent on Reading**
She reads for **3 hours**.

So, remaining time after reading is:
$$
12 - 3 = 9 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Time Spent on Video Games**
She plays video games for **1/3 of the remaining time** (which is 9 hours):
$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Time Spent on Soccer**
The rest of the time is spent playing soccer. So:

$$
\text{Time on soccer} = 9 - 3 = 6 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Percentage of Weekend Spent on Soccer**
Now, we find what percentage of the total weekend time (12 hours) is spent on soccer:

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{6}{12} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**50%** of her weekend is spent playing soccer.
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Anthony starts with 50 pencils.

---

### Step 2: He gives **1/2** of his pencils to Brandon.

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \text{ pencils}
$$

So, Anthony gives away **25 pencils**, and now he has:

$$
50 - 25 = 25 \text{ pencils left}
$$

---

### Step 3: He gives **3/5** of the remaining pencils to Charlie.

He has **25 pencils** left after giving some to Brandon.

$$
\frac{3}{5} \times 25 = 15 \text{ pencils}
$$

So, Anthony gives **15 pencils** to Charlie, and now he has:

$$
25 - 15 = 10 \text{ pencils}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Anthony kept **10 pencils**.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how long Jack is gone from home.

---

### **1. Distance to the museum:**
Jack travels **150 miles** to the museum and **150 miles** back, so total distance:

$$
\text{Total distance} = 150 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 300 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### **2. Speed:**
He drives at a constant speed of **75 mph** both ways.

---

### **3. Time spent driving:**

We use the formula:

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
$$

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 4 \text{ hours}
$$

So, Jack spends **4 hours** driving.

---

### **4. Time spent at the museum:**

He spends **6 hours** at the museum.

---

### **5. Total time away from home:**

$$
\text{Total time} = \text{Driving time} + \text{Time at museum} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = \boxed{10 \text{ hours}}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jack is gone from home for 10 hours.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of wheels needed for cars
Henry needs to assemble **57 cars**, and each car requires **4 wheels**.

$$
\text{Wheels for cars} = 57 \times 4 = 228
$$

### Step 2: Calculate the number of wheels needed for motorcycles
He also needs to assemble **73 motorcycles**, and each motorcycle requires **2 wheels**.

$$
\text{Wheels for motorcycles} = 73 \times 2 = 146
$$

### Step 3: Total wheels needed
Add the wheels needed for cars and motorcycles:

$$
\text{Total wheels needed} = 228 + 146 = 374
$$

### Step 4: Subtract from the total wheels available
Henry has a box with **650 wheels**. So, the number of wheels left after assembling all toys is:

$$
\text{Wheels left} = 650 - 374 = 276
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**276 wheels will be left.**
Sure! Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Original price of the laptop**: $1000  
2. **Discount percentage**: 20%  
3. **Calculate the discount amount**:  
   $$
   \text{Discount} = 20\% \times 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200
   $$  
4. **Subtract the discount from the original price**:  
   $$
   \text{Final price} = 1000 - 200 = 800
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: You have to pay **$800**.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of movies**
Mike has **600 movies**.

---

### **Step 2: Movies in series (1/3 of total)**
- A third of the movies are in various series:
  $$
  \frac{1}{3} \times 600 = 200 \text{ movies}
  $$

- These can be bought for **$6 each**, instead of the normal price of **$10**.
- So, cost for series movies:
  $$
  200 \times 6 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Remaining movies after removing series**
- Total remaining movies:
  $$
  600 - 200 = 400 \text{ movies}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Older movies (40% of remaining)**
- 40% of the remaining 400 movies are older movies:
  $$
  0.4 \times 400 = 160 \text{ movies}
  $$

- These older movies cost **$5 each**.
- Cost for older movies:
  $$
  160 \times 5 = 800 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### **Step 5: Remaining normal movies**
- After removing series and older movies:
  $$
  400 - 160 = 240 \text{ movies}
  $$

- These are normal movies at **$10 each**.
- Cost for normal movies:
  $$
  240 \times 10 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### **Step 6: Total cost**
Now add up all the costs:

$$
\text{Total cost} = 1200 + 800 + 2400 = \boxed{4400} \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{4400}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the prices per pound
- **Peaches**: $2.00 per pound  
- **Plums**: $1.00 per pound  
- **Apricots**: $3.00 per pound  

### Step 2: Find out how much Winston picked of each fruit
- **Peaches**: 6 pounds  
- **Plums**: 8 pounds  
- **Apricots**: 6 pounds  

### Step 3: Calculate the cost for each type of fruit

**Peaches**:  
$ 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$2.00/\text{pound} = \$12.00 $

**Plums**:  
$ 8 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.00/\text{pound} = \$8.00 $

**Apricots**:  
$ 6 \text{ pounds} \times \$3.00/\text{pound} = \$18.00 $

### Step 4: Add up all the costs

$$
\$12.00 + \$8.00 + \$18.00 = \$38.00
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Winston spent \$38.00 on fruit.**
We are given the following information:

- Total time spent driving and hiking: **6 hours**
- Average driving speed: **50 miles per hour**
- Hiking speed is **5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed**
- Time spent hiking: **1.5 hours**

We are asked to find the **total distance** to their vacation spot, which is the **sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked**.

---

### Step 1: Find the hiking speed

Hiking speed = (Half of driving speed) - 5  
= (½ × 50) - 5  
= 25 - 5  
= **20 miles per hour**

---

### Step 2: Find the distance hiked

Distance = Speed × Time  
= 20 mph × 1.5 hours  
= **30 miles**

---

### Step 3: Find the time spent driving

Total time = driving time + hiking time  
6 hours = driving time + 1.5 hours  
Driving time = 6 - 1.5 = **4.5 hours**

---

### Step 4: Find the distance driven

Distance = Speed × Time  
= 50 mph × 4.5 hours  
= **225 miles**

---

### Step 5: Find total distance to the vacation spot

Total distance = distance driven + distance hiked  
= 225 miles + 30 miles  
= **255 miles**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**255 miles**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given:
- **Ava and Emma** each play one level.
- **Scoring system:**
  - **10 points per enemy jumped on**
  - **5 points per berry collected**
  - **30 points per second left on the timer**

---

### Let’s define variables:

Let’s assume:
- Let $ E $ be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Then Ava jumps on $ E + 8 $ enemies (since she jumps on 8 more).
- Let $ B $ be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Then Ava collects $ B + 3 $ berries (since she collects 3 more).
- Let $ T $ be the number of seconds left on the timer for Emma.
- Then Ava has $ T - 4 $ seconds left on the timer (since she finishes 4 seconds slower).

---

### Step 1: Calculate Emma's score

Emma's score =  
$ 10E + 5B + 30T $

---

### Step 2: Calculate Ava's score

Ava's score =  
$ 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T - 4) $

Now expand that:

$$
= 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120
$$

$$
= 10E + 5B + 30T + (80 + 15 - 120)
$$

$$
= 10E + 5B + 30T - 25
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the difference between their scores

Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score  
$$
= [10E + 5B + 30T - 25] - [10E + 5B + 30T]
$$

$$
= -25
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
The **difference between their two scores is 25 points**, with **Ava scoring 25 points less than Emma**.
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Total cost of all pizzas
The total cost for the four pizzas is:
$$
\$64
$$

### Step 2: Cost of two of the pizzas
We are told that **two of the pizzas cost \$30** in total.

So, the combined cost of the other two pizzas is:
$$
\$64 - \$30 = \$34
$$

### Step 3: Cost of each of the other two pizzas
Since the other two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2:
$$
\frac{\$34}{2} = \$17
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Each of the other two pizzas cost **\$17**.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the given information

- **Chase and Rider ride their bikes** **thrice a day** for **5 days**.
- On **2 other days**, they ride **twice the times** they do on usual days.

So, we need to find how many times they ride their bikes in total **in a week** (7 days).

---

### Step 2: Calculate rides on "usual" days

They ride **3 times per day** for **5 days**:

$$
3 \text{ times/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ times}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate rides on the "extra" days

On **2 other days**, they ride **twice** as much as usual. That means:

$$
2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ times/day}
$$

For 2 such days:

$$
6 \text{ times/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ times}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add up all the rides

Now add the rides from both types of days:

$$
15 \text{ (usual days)} + 12 \text{ (extra days)} = 27 \text{ times}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{27}
$$

They ride their bikes **27 times a week**.
We are given the following information:

- Bob initially had **7 fish** in his pond:
  - **3 orange**
  - **4 white**

- He bought **17 more fish**, which were a **mixed tank of both white and orange fish**.

- After adding these 17 fish, he found that he now had **twice as many orange fish as white fish**.

We are to find: **How many white fish did Bob buy?**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ x $ = number of **white fish** Bob bought
- $ y $ = number of **orange fish** Bob bought

From the problem:
- Total fish bought = 17  
  So:  
  $$
  x + y = 17 \tag{1}
  $$

Bob originally had:
- 3 orange fish
- 4 white fish

After buying $ x $ white and $ y $ orange fish:
- Total white fish = $ 4 + x $
- Total orange fish = $ 3 + y $

According to the problem, after adding the new fish, he had **twice as many orange fish as white fish**:
$$
3 + y = 2(4 + x) \tag{2}
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve the system of equations

From equation (1):  
$$
y = 17 - x
$$

Substitute into equation (2):
$$
3 + (17 - x) = 2(4 + x)
$$

Simplify:
$$
20 - x = 8 + 2x
$$

Bring all terms to one side:
$$
20 - x - 8 - 2x = 0 \\
12 - 3x = 0 \\
3x = 12 \\
x = 4
$$

---

### Step 3: Final Answer

So, Bob bought **4 white fish**.

✅ **Answer: 4 white fish**.
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Determine the total weekly distance driven:**
Andy drives to work **5 miles one way**, and he does this **Monday to Friday** (5 days).

So, the **total weekly distance** is:
$$
5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ (to and from)} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 50 \text{ miles/week}
$$

---

### 2. **Calculate how many gallons of gas are used per week:**

Andy’s car gets **10 miles per gallon (MPG)**.

So, the **gas used per week** is:
$$
\frac{50 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ MPG}} = 5 \text{ gallons/week}
$$

---

### 3. **Calculate the cost of gas per week:**

Gas costs **$3 per gallon**.

So, the **weekly fuel cost** is:
$$
5 \text{ gallons} \times \$3/\text{gallon} = \$15
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Andy's car consumes $15 per week in fuel.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Carrie received

- **Twenties**: She was given **10 twenties**  
  Each twenty is worth $20, so:
  $$
  10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars}
  $$

- **Quarters**: She was given **140 quarters**  
  Each quarter is worth $0.25, so:
  $$
  140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars}
  $$

- **Total money received**:
  $$
  200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Determine how much she spent

She **spent all the quarters**, which we already calculated as **$35**.

She also spent **3/5 of the twenties**.

- Total value of twenties = $200  
- 3/5 of that is:
  $$
  \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Add the amounts spent

- Quarters spent: $35  
- Twenties spent: $120  
- **Total amount paid for lunch**:
  $$
  35 + 120 = \boxed{155} \text{ dollars}
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{155} \text{ dollars}
$$
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 3: Add the total number of fruits
$$
\text{Total fruits} = 110 + 32 = 142
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants.**
We are told that Samwell's store sold a total of **40 TVs**, and the breakdown is as follows:

- One-fourth (1/4) are **smart TVs**
- One-eighth (1/8) are **analog TVs**
- The **rest** are **OLED TVs**

We are asked: **How many OLED TVs were sold?**

---

### Step 1: Find the number of smart TVs
One-fourth of the total TVs are smart TVs:

$$
\text{Smart TVs} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the number of analog TVs
One-eighth of the total TVs are analog TVs:

$$
\text{Analog TVs} = \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the number of OLED TVs
The rest of the TVs are OLED TVs. So subtract the number of smart and analog TVs from the total:

$$
\text{OLED TVs} = 40 - (\text{Smart TVs} + \text{Analog TVs}) = 40 - (10 + 5) = 40 - 15 = 25
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{25}
$$

So, **25 OLED TVs** were sold.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total cost of the trip:** $300  
2. **School covers half the cost:**  
   $$
   \frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150
   $$  
   So, the school will cover **$150**.

3. **John has already raised:** $50

4. **How much more does John need to raise?**  
   Subtract what John has from the amount he still needs to cover:  
   $$
   150 - 50 = 100
   $$

Let's break the problem down step by step:

---

### **1. Initial temperature during the day:**
- The temperature is **45 degrees**.

### **2. Temperature change during the night:**
- It gets **33 degrees colder** than during the day.
- So, the temperature at night becomes:
  $$
  45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees}
  $$

### **3. What happens if the temperature falls below 32 degrees?**
- The pipes will **freeze**, so we need to make sure the temperature stays **above or equal to 32 degrees**.

### **4. How much does each log of wood heat the house?**
- Each log raises the temperature by **5 degrees**.

### **5. What is the temperature drop that needs to be compensated?**
- From **12 degrees** (night temperature) to **32 degrees** (minimum safe temperature):
  $$
  32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees}
  $$

### **6. How many logs are needed to raise the temperature by 20 degrees?**
- Since each log raises the temperature by 5 degrees:
  $$
  \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ logs}
  $$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Carson needs to burn **4 logs** to prevent the pipes from freezing.
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Total number of people**
We are told that **90 people** were required to split into groups.

---

### **Step 2: Number of groups formed**
They were split into **9-person groups**.

So, the total number of groups is:

$$
\frac{90}{9} = 10 \text{ groups}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Fraction of groups that brought seashells**
We're told that **3/5 of the number of groups** had members bring back **2 seashells each**.

So, first calculate how many groups that is:

$$
\frac{3}{5} \times 10 = 6 \text{ groups}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Number of people in those groups**
Each of these 6 groups has **9 people**, so:

$$
6 \times 9 = 54 \text{ people}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Number of seashells brought**
Each of these 54 people brought **2 seashells**:

$$
54 \times 2 = 108 \text{ seashells}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{108} \text{ seashells}
$$
Let's solve this step by step:

- The train begins with **172 people**.

---

### First stop:
- **47 people get off**:  
  $ 172 - 47 = 125 $

- **13 people get on**:  
  $ 125 + 13 = 138 $

So after the first stop, there are **138 people** on the train.

---

### Second stop:
- **38 people get off**:  
  $ 138 - 38 = 100 $

---

### Final Answer:
There are **100 people** on the train.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Bottle caps found per day**:  
   Damien finds **10 bottle caps** each day.

2. **Value of each bottle cap**:  
   Each bottle cap is worth **$0.25**.

3. **Daily earnings**:  
   To find out how much he earns in one day, multiply the number of bottle caps by their value:  
   $$
   10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$2.50/\text{day}
   $$

4. **Earnings over 30 days**:  
   Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in the month:  
   $$
   \$2.50/\text{day} \times 30 \text{ days} = \$75
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Damien makes \$75 in a 30-day month.**
Let's break down the problem step by step:

### 1. **Regular hourly rate:**
Jamie earns **$20 per hour** for her regular 8-hour workday.

### 2. **Special hourly rate (for extra hours):**
If she works **additional hours**, she is paid **150% of her regular hourly rate**.

So, the special hourly rate is:
$$
150\% \times 20 = 1.5 \times 20 = 30 \text{ dollars per hour}
$$

### 3. **Hours worked on Tuesday:**
She worked **11 hours** in total.

Out of these, **8 hours** are regular, and the remaining **3 hours** are overtime.

### 4. **Calculate pay:**

- Regular pay for 8 hours:
$$
8 \times 20 = 160 \text{ dollars}
$$

- Overtime pay for 3 hours at $30/hour:
$$
3 \times 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
$$

### 5. **Total pay for the day:**

### ✅ Final Answer: **$250**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Female lions**: The zookeeper counts **12** female lions.

2. **Male lions**: She counts **half as many male lions** as female lions.  
   So, male lions = $ \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 $ male lions.

3. **Lion cubs**: There are **14** lion cubs.

Now, to find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we add all these together:

$$
\text{Total lions} = \text{Female lions} + \text{Male lions} + \text{Lion cubs}
$$

$$
\text{Total lions} = 12 + 6 + 14 = 32
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **32 lions** are in the enclosure.
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Original price of the jeans:**  
$$
\$40
$$

### 2. **Discount offered:**  
$$
25\% \text{ off}
$$

To find the discount amount:
$$
25\% \text{ of } \$40 = 0.25 \times 40 = \$10
$$

### 3. **Discounted price of the jeans:**
$$
\$40 - \$10 = \$30
$$

### 4. **Amount Mike pays with:**  
$$
\$50
$$

### 5. **Money left over after buying the jeans:**
$$
\$50 - \$30 = \$20
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$20}
$$

Mike will have **\$20 left over** after buying the jeans.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Given:
- **Initial number of employees**: 200  
- **New employees hired each month**: 20  
- **Number of months**: 3  
- **Salary per employee per month**: $4,000  

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of employees after 3 months

Each month, 20 new employees are added.

So, after 3 months:
$$
\text{Total employees} = \text{Initial employees} + (\text{New employees per month} \times \text{Number of months})
$$
$$
= 200 + (20 \times 3) = 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ employees}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the monthly salary cost

Each employee is paid $4,000 per month.

$$
\text{Monthly salary cost} = \text{Total employees} \times \text{Salary per employee}
$$
$$
= 260 \times 4000 = 1,040,000 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid over 3 months

$$
\text{Total salary paid} = \text{Monthly salary cost} \times \text{Number of months}
$$
$$
= 1,040,000 \times 3 = 3,120,000 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$3,120,000}
$$

This is the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **"Deck the Halls" is sung twice**, and each performance is **150 seconds** long.  
   So, total time for "Deck the Halls" =  
   $ 2 \times 150 = 300 $ seconds.

2. **"Jingle Bells" is sung once**, and it is **240 seconds** long.  
   So, total time for "Jingle Bells" =  
   $ 1 \times 240 = 240 $ seconds.

3. **Total caroling time** is the sum of both songs:  
   $ 300 + 240 = 540 $ seconds.

### ✅ Final Answer: **540 seconds**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine Billy's hourly rate over time**

- **Initial rate:** $10 per hour  
- **After 2 months (raise of $0.50):**  
  - New rate = $10 + $0.50 = **$10.50 per hour**  
- **On his first anniversary (another raise of $1.00):**  
  - New rate = $10.50 + $1.00 = **$11.50 per hour**

So, Billy works at different rates depending on how long he has been working.

---

### **Step 2: Determine Sally's starting hourly rate**

Sally’s starting salary is **$0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary was**, which was **$10 per hour**.

- Sally’s starting rate = $10 + $0.50 = **$10.50 per hour**

Assume Sally also works for the same amount of time as Billy — but we are only comparing their **earnings if both work 20 hours**.

So we will calculate **how much each earns in 20 hours**, based on their **current hourly rate** (which for Sally is her starting rate, and for Billy it's his current rate after all raises).

---

### **Step 3: Calculate earnings for both**

- **Billy's hourly rate:** $11.50  
- **Sally's hourly rate:** $10.50  
- **Hours worked:** 20

Now compute:

- **Billy's earnings:**  
  $11.50/hour × 20 hours = **$230**

- **Sally's earnings:**  
  $10.50/hour × 20 hours = **$210**

---

### **Step 4: Find the difference**

$$
\text{Difference} = 230 - 210 = \boxed{\$20}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Billy will earn $20 more than Sally in 20 hours.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Cost of one loaf of bread** = $2  
2. **Cost of one bagel** = $1  

Now, calculate the total cost for each item:

- **3 loaves of bread**:  
  $ 3 \times 2 = 6 $ dollars

- **2 bagels**:  
  $ 2 \times 1 = 2 $ dollars

Now, find how much more 3 loaves of bread cost than 2 bagels:

$$
6 - 2 = 4
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$4 more**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Pierson's score
Pierson scored:
$$
278 \text{ points}
$$

### Step 2: Nikita's score
Nikita scored **11 more than half as many as Pierson**.

- Half of Pierson's score is:
$$
\frac{278}{2} = 139
$$

- Add 11 to that:
$$
139 + 11 = 150
$$

So, Nikita scored **150 points**.

### Step 3: Total points
Now, add Pierson's and Nikita's scores together:
$$
278 + 150 = 428
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{428}
$$
Let's break the problem down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Find the number of students**

- There are **40 classes**.
- Each class has an average of **25 students**.

$$
\text{Total number of students} = 40 \times 25 = 1000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the number of teachers**

- There are **40 classes**.
- Each class has **3 teachers**.

$$
\text{Total number of teachers} = 40 \times 3 = 120
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total number of trees planted**

- Each **student plants 1 tree**:
  $$
  1000 \text{ students} \times 1 \text{ tree/student} = 1000 \text{ trees}
  $$

- Each **teacher plants 2 trees**:
  $$
  120 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ trees/teacher} = 240 \text{ trees}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Add the trees planted by students and teachers**

$$
\text{Total trees} = 1000 + 240 = \boxed{1240}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{1240} \text{ trees}
$$
We are told that Bubbles currently has the following stuffed animals:

- 3 puppies  
- 5 koalas  
- 2 zebras  
- 4 frogs  

Let’s first calculate the **total number of stuffed animals she currently has**:

$$
3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 \text{ stuffed animals}
$$

Now, she wants to **buy enough stuffed goats so that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30% of all her stuffed animals**.

Let’s let $ x $ be the number of **stuffed goats** she needs to buy.

After buying $ x $ goats, the total number of stuffed animals will be:

$$
14 + x
$$

And the number of goats will be $ x $. We want the **percentage of goats** to be **30%**, so we can write the equation:

$$
\frac{x}{14 + x} = 0.30
$$

### Step 1: Solve the equation

Multiply both sides by $ 14 + x $:

$$
x = 0.30(14 + x)
$$

Distribute the 0.30 on the right-hand side:

$$
x = 4.2 + 0.30x
$$

Subtract $ 0.30x $ from both sides:

$$
x - 0.30x = 4.2
$$

$$
0.70x = 4.2
$$

Divide both sides by 0.70:

$$
x = \frac{4.2}{0.70} = 6
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Bubbles should buy **6 stuffed goats**.
Let's break the problem down step by step to find out how many more hours Kris needs to play to reach **30 hours**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate total hours played in the first 2 weeks

- She plays **half an hour (0.5 hours)** every day.
- There are **7 days** in a week, so in **2 weeks**, that’s:

$$
2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days}
$$

$$
14 \text{ days} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/day} = 7 \text{ hours}
$$

So, she plays **7 hours** in the first 2 weeks.

---

### Step 2: Calculate total hours played in the next week

- She plays **2 hours** every day for **1 week**:

$$
7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ hours/day} = 14 \text{ hours}
$$

So, she plays **14 hours** in the next week.

---

### Step 3: Add up the hours played so far

$$
7 \text{ hours (first 2 weeks)} + 14 \text{ hours (next week)} = 21 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find out how many more hours she needs to play

She needs a total of **30 hours** to earn the achievement.

$$
30 \text{ hours (total needed)} - 21 \text{ hours (played so far)} = 9 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Kris still needs to play 9 more hours** to earn the achievement.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the situation**

- **Car A** is traveling at **60 mph**.
- **Car B** passes Car A and travels at **70 mph**.
- After passing, both cars continue on the highway at their respective constant speeds.
- We are asked: **How many miles will separate them after 2 hours?**

---

### **Step 2: Determine the relative speed between the two cars**

Since Car B is moving faster than Car A, the **relative speed** between them is:

$$
\text{Relative Speed} = \text{Speed of Car B} - \text{Speed of Car A} = 70 - 60 = 10 \text{ mph}
$$

This means that **Car B is pulling away from Car A at a rate of 10 miles per hour**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the distance between them after 2 hours**

We now use the formula:

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Relative Speed} \times \text{Time}
$$

$$
\text{Distance} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{20} \text{ miles}
$$

After 2 hours, the two cars will be **20 miles apart**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Cost of the diamond**: $600  
2. **Cost of the gold**: $300  

**Total cost before the premium** = $600 + $300 = **$900**

3. **He pays a 30% premium** on the total cost.

To find the 30% premium:
$$
\text{Premium} = 0.30 \times 900 = 270
$$

4. **Total amount paid** = Total cost + Premium  
$$
= 900 + 270 = \boxed{1170}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$1,170**
We are given the following information:

- **Third-graders**: 340 out of 500 passed  
- **Fourth-graders**: 40 out of 100 passed  
- **Fifth-graders**: Pass rate is **twice** the fourth-grade pass rate  
- We are to find the **overall pass rate** for the school.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the pass rate for each grade

#### Third graders:
$$
\text{Pass rate} = \frac{340}{500} = 0.68 = 68\%
$$

#### Fourth graders:
$$
\text{Pass rate} = \frac{40}{100} = 0.40 = 40\%
$$

#### Fifth graders:
The pass rate is **twice** the fourth-grade pass rate:
$$
\text{Pass rate} = 2 \times 0.40 = 0.80 = 80\%
$$

Now, we need to find the **total number of students** and the **total number of students who passed**.

---

### Step 2: Total number of students

- Third graders: 500  
- Fourth graders: 100  
- Fifth graders: 400  

$$
\text{Total students} = 500 + 100 + 400 = 1000
$$

---

### Step 3: Total number of students who passed

- Third graders: 340  
- Fourth graders: 40  
- Fifth graders: $ 400 \times 0.80 = 320 $

$$
\text{Total passed} = 340 + 40 + 320 = 700
$$

---

### Step 4: Overall pass rate

$$
\text{Overall pass rate} = \frac{\text{Total passed}}{\text{Total students}} = \frac{700}{1000} = 0.70 = 70\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{70\%}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Determine the number of glass chips Milo has.**

- Each bag contains **72 glass chips**.
- Milo has **2 bags**.

$$
\text{Total chips} = 2 \times 72 = 144 \text{ chips}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find out how many chips are needed per square inch.**

- It takes **12 glass chips per square inch**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how many square inches Milo can make with 144 chips.**

$$
\text{Square inches} = \frac{144}{12} = 12 \text{ square inches}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Use the height to find the length.**

- The mosaic is **3 inches tall**.
- Area = Length × Height  
- So, we solve for **Length**:

$$
\text{Length} = \frac{\text{Area}}{\text{Height}} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{4} \text{ inches long}
$$
We are given:

- **10 quarts of tea are left** at the end of the party.
- **4 students each drank 1.5 quarts** of tea.
- **16 students each drank 2 quarts** of tea.

We are to find out how many **gallons of tea were at the beginning of the party**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate total amount of tea consumed

#### Tea consumed by 4 students:
$$
4 \times 1.5 = 6 \text{ quarts}
$$

#### Tea consumed by 16 students:
$$
16 \times 2 = 32 \text{ quarts}
$$

#### Total tea consumed:
$$
6 + 32 = 38 \text{ quarts}
$$

---

### Step 2: Add the remaining tea

Total tea at the beginning = tea consumed + tea left

$$
38 \text{ quarts} + 10 \text{ quarts} = 48 \text{ quarts}
$$

---

### Step 3: Convert quarts to gallons

There are **4 quarts in a gallon**, so:

$$
\frac{48}{4} = 12 \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{12} \text{ gallons}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial order**: Dale ordered 100 butterscotch candies.
2. **Candies sold initially**: He sold 150 candies.  
   - Wait a second — he only had 100 candies ordered, but he sold 150? That means he must have **ordered more** or **had some extra**.

3. **He then ordered 100 more**: So now he has:
   $$
   100 \text{ (initial)} + 100 \text{ (new order)} = 200 \text{ total candies}
   $$

4. **He sold 150 candies** already.  
   So the number of candies he still needs to sell is:
   $$
   200 - 150 = 50
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **Dale still needs to sell 50 candies.**
We are told that the number of students **doubles every month**, and we start with **10 students** at the beginning of the year.

We need to find how many **additional students** would have joined by the **end of May**, above and beyond the original 10 students.

---

### Step-by-step:

Let’s define the number of students at the **beginning of each month** (Month 0 = beginning of the year).

- **Month 0 (Start of year):** 10 students  
- **Month 1 (End of first month):** $ 10 \times 2 = 20 $ students  
- **Month 2 (End of second month):** $ 20 \times 2 = 40 $ students  
- **Month 3 (End of third month):** $ 40 \times 2 = 80 $ students  
- **Month 4 (End of fourth month):** $ 80 \times 2 = 160 $ students  
- **Month 5 (End of fifth month, i.e., end of May):** $ 160 \times 2 = 320 $ students  

So, by the **end of May**, there are **320 students** on campus.

---

### Now, find the **additional students** who joined:

$$
\text{Additional students} = \text{Total students at end of May} - \text{Original students}
$$

$$
= 320 - 10 = \boxed{310}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**310 additional students** would have joined by the end of May.
We are given:

- Felix charges **$0.25 per branch** he climbs.
- He made **$105 in total during the week**.
- We are asked to find the **average number of branches he climbed per day**.

---

### Step 1: Find total number of branches climbed in the week

Since he earns **$0.25 per branch**, we can find the total number of branches by dividing his total earnings by the cost per branch:

$$
\text{Total branches} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Earnings per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
$$

$$
\text{Total branches} = 420
$$

So, Felix climbed **420 branches** during the week.

---

### Step 2: Find average branches per day

Assuming a **7-day week**, we divide the total number of branches by 7 to get the average per day:

$$
\text{Average branches per day} = \frac{420}{7} = 60
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**On average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.**
Let's break this down step by step to find the **total number of petals** in the vase.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total petals picked

Rose picks flowers in groups. We'll calculate the petals for each group:

- **First group:**  
  3 flowers × 5 petals = **15 petals**

- **Second group:**  
  4 flowers × 6 petals = **24 petals**

- **Third group:**  
  5 flowers × 4 petals = **20 petals**

- **Fourth group:**  
  6 flowers × 7 petals = **42 petals**

Now, add them all together:

$$
15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = 101 \text{ petals}
$$

---

### Step 2: Account for the dropped and blown away petals

She drops **1 of each type**, meaning she loses:

- 1 flower from the first group (5 petals)
- 1 flower from the second group (6 petals)
- 1 flower from the third group (4 petals)
- 1 flower from the fourth group (7 petals)

So, total petals lost:

$$
5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 \text{ petals}
$$

---

### Step 3: Subtract the lost petals from the total

$$
101 - 22 = 79 \text{ petals}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{79} \text{ petals}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Total number of marshmallows
- The bag has **35 marshmallows**.

### Step 2: Marshmallows used to make S'mores
- John makes **9 S'mores**, using **9 marshmallows**.
- DeSean makes **9 S'mores**, using **9 marshmallows**.
- So, total used = **9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows**.

### Step 3: Marshmallows dropped on the ground
- They dropped **3 marshmallows** on the ground. These are **not usable**.

### Step 4: Calculate remaining marshmallows
- Total used = 18
- Dropped = 3  
- Remaining = 35 - 18 - 3 = **14 marshmallows**

### Step 5: How many S'mores can each kid have with the remaining marshmallows?
- There are **14 marshmallows left**.
- Since each S'more uses **1 marshmallow**, they can make **14 more S'mores** in total.

Now, we need to divide these **14 marshmallows** between **John and DeSean** equally.

- Each kid gets = 14 ÷ 2 = **7 marshmallows**

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Each kid can have 7 S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- **Jack** plays a game for **20 minutes** with **1 quarter**.
- **Two friends** are **worse**, and they can play for **half as long** as Jack → **10 minutes per quarter**.
- **One friend** is **better**, and they can play for **1.5 times as long** as Jack → **30 minutes per quarter**.
- They all **play together for 4 hours**.

We need to find out **how much money (in quarters) was used in total** during that time.

---

### **Step 1: Convert total playing time into minutes**

$$
4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many quarters each person uses**

Each person plays **for 240 minutes**, but the number of quarters they use depends on how long each quarter lasts for them.

#### **Jack**
- Plays for **20 minutes per quarter**
- Number of quarters = $ \frac{240}{20} = 12 $ quarters

#### **Worse Friend 1**
- Plays for **10 minutes per quarter**
- Number of quarters = $ \frac{240}{10} = 24 $ quarters

#### **Worse Friend 2**
- Same as above: **24 quarters**

#### **Better Friend**
- Plays for **30 minutes per quarter**
- Number of quarters = $ \frac{240}{30} = 8 $ quarters

---

### **Step 3: Add up all the quarters used**

$$
\text{Total quarters} = 12 + 24 + 24 + 8 = 68 \text{ quarters}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Convert quarters to dollars**

- 1 quarter = $0.25
- Total money used = $ 68 \times 0.25 = 17 $

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$17}
$$
We are given a recipe for a salt scrub, and we need to determine how many **ounces of oil** Tanya uses in each batch. Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define Variables

Let’s assign variables to each ingredient based on what we know:

- Let **z** = amount of **citrus zest** (in ounces)
- Since **zest = fragrance**, then **f = z**
- Let **s** = amount of **salt** (in ounces)
- Since **salt = sugar**, then **su = s**
- Let **o** = amount of **oil** (in ounces)
- We’re told that **oil = 2 × salt**, so **o = 2s**

Now, we know the total weight of the scrub is **10 ounces**. So:

$$
\text{Total} = \text{oil} + \text{salt} + \text{sugar} + \text{fragrance} + \text{citrus zest}
$$

Substitute using our variables:

$$
o + s + su + f + z = 10
$$

But remember:
- $ o = 2s $
- $ su = s $
- $ f = z $

So substitute all into the equation:

$$
(2s) + s + s + z + z = 10
$$

Simplify:

$$
2s + s + s + z + z = 10 \\
4s + 2z = 10
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the Relationship Between Salt and Zest

We are also told:

> She uses **twice as much salt as zest**, so:

$$
s = 2z
$$

Now substitute this into the previous equation:

$$
4s + 2z = 10 \\
4(2z) + 2z = 10 \\
8z + 2z = 10 \\
10z = 10 \\
z = 1
$$

---

### Step 3: Find All Quantities

Now that we know:

- $ z = 1 $ ounce (citrus zest)
- $ f = z = 1 $ ounce (fragrance)
- $ s = 2z = 2 $ ounces (salt)
- $ su = s = 2 $ ounces (sugar)
- $ o = 2s = 4 $ ounces (oil)

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{4} \text{ ounces of oil}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Cost of goats:**  
   John buys 3 goats at $500 each.  
   So, the total cost for the goats is:  
   $$
   3 \times 500 = 1500
   $$

2. **Cost of cows:**  
   John buys 2 cows at $1500 each.  
   So, the total cost for the cows is:  
   $$
   2 \times 1500 = 3000
   $$

3. **Total amount spent:**  
   Add the cost of the goats and the cows:  
   $$
   1500 + 3000 = 4500
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$4500**
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Total cupcakes needed**:  
   Paul needs **63** cupcakes for the party.

2. **Cupcakes he already has**:  
   - Chocolate cupcakes: **8**  
   - Toffee cupcakes: **40**  
   - Total cupcakes he has = 8 + 40 = **48**

3. **Cupcakes he still needs to buy**:  
   Subtract the number of cupcakes he has from the total needed:  
   $ 63 - 48 = 15 $

### ✅ Final Answer:

### **Step 1: Determine how many cars Joe has initially**

We are told:

- Robert has **20 cars**.
- Joe has **twice as many cars as Robert**.

So,  
$$
\text{Joe's initial number of cars} = 2 \times 20 = 40
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how many cars Joe sells**

Joe sells **20%** of his cars.

$$
\text{Cars sold} = 20\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.20 \times 40 = 8
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how many cars Joe gives away**

He gives away **twice as many cars as he sold** to his mother.

$$
\text{Cars given away} = 2 \times 8 = 16
$$

---

### **Step 4: Find out how many cars Joe has left**

Start with the original number of cars (40), subtract the ones he sold and the ones he gave away:

$$
\text{Cars remaining} = 40 - 8 - 16 = 16
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{16}
$$

Joe remains with **16 cars** after selling and giving some to his mother.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### **Step 1: Understand the total amount raised**

The charity raises a total of:

$$
\$175,000
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how much came from organizations**

We are told that $ \$50,000 $ comes from **organizations**. So, the rest must have come from the students.

$$
\text{Amount from students} = \text{Total} - \text{From organizations}
$$

$$
\text{Amount from students} = \$175,000 - \$50,000 = \$125,000
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find out how much each student raised**

There are **20 students**, and they all earned the **same amount**. To find how much each student raised, divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students:

$$
\text{Amount per student} = \frac{\$125,000}{20}
$$

$$
\text{Amount per student} = \$6,250
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$6,250}
$$

Each student raised **\$6,250**.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Time walked on the first day
Sandy walked for **8 hours** on the first day.

### Step 2: Time walked on the second day
She walked **half as many hours** on the second day as she did on the first day.

So, time on the second day =  
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \text{ hours}
$$

### Step 3: Total time in hours
Total time over two days =  
$$
8 + 4 = 12 \text{ hours}
$$

### Step 4: Convert hours to minutes
Since 1 hour = 60 minutes,  
$$
12 \text{ hours} \times 60 = 720 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**720 minutes**
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Initial number of cars
Hunter counted **50 cars** when entering class in the morning.

---

### Step 2: During the first break
He counted **20 more cars**.  
So, total number of cars after the first break is:

$$
50 + 20 = 70 \text{ cars}
$$

---

### Step 3: During lunch break
He noticed that **half the number of cars had gone**.  
That means the number of cars **decreased by half**, or **half remained**.

So, the number of cars remaining after lunch break is:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35 \text{ cars}
$$

Therefore, the number of cars that **left** during lunch break is:

$$
70 - 35 = 35 \text{ cars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{35}
$$

So, **35 cars** were counted as having left during the lunch break.

Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many total points **Sasha** scored during both games.

---

### **Game 1:**
- **Sasha** had **home court advantage**.
- Sasha scored **14 points**.
- Julie scored **4 fewer points than Sasha** in this game.

So,  
**Julie's score in Game 1 = 14 - 4 = 10 points**

---

### **Game 2:**
- This was an **away game** for Sasha (at Julie's home court).
- Sasha scored **6 fewer points than Julie's score in Game 1**.

We already know from Game 1 that:
- **Julie scored 10 points** in Game 1

So,  
**Sasha's score in Game 2 = 10 - 6 = 4 points**

---

### **Total Points Scored by Sasha:**
- Game 1: 14 points
- Game 2: 4 points

$$
\text{Total} = 14 + 4 = \boxed{18}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Find the total number of tins of **cat food**
Kimberly bought **8 packages** of cat food, and each package has **11 tins**.

$$
8 \text{ packages} \times 11 \text{ tins per package} = 88 \text{ tins of cat food}
$$

### Step 2: Find the total number of tins of **dog food**
She also bought **6 packages** of dog food, and each package has **6 tins**.

$$
6 \text{ packages} \times 6 \text{ tins per package} = 36 \text{ tins of dog food}
$$

### Step 3: Find how many more tins of **cat food** than **dog food** she bought

$$
88 \text{ tins (cat)} - 36 \text{ tins (dog)} = 52 \text{ tins}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**52 more tins of cat food than dog food.**
We are given the following information:

- Total number of cards: **341**
- Becca has **12 more** cards than Smendrick.
- Smendrick has **3 times** the number of cards that PJ has.

Let’s define variables for each person:

- Let **P** be the number of cards **PJ** has.
- Then, **Smendrick** has **3P** cards.
- And **Becca** has **3P + 12** cards (since she has 12 more than Smendrick).

Now, add up all their cards:

$$
\text{Total} = P + 3P + (3P + 12) = 341
$$

Simplify the left side:

$$
P + 3P + 3P + 12 = 341 \\
7P + 12 = 341
$$

Now solve for **P**:

$$
7P = 341 - 12 = 329 \\
P = \frac{329}{7} = 47
$$

So:
- **PJ** has **47** cards
- **Smendrick** has **3 × 47 = 141** cards
- **Becca** has **141 + 12 = 153** cards

### ✅ Final Answer: **Becca has 153 cards.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many eggs Cindy had altogether.

---

### Step 1: Green Eggs  
Cindy had **5 green eggs**.

---

### Step 2: Blue Eggs  
She had **twice as many blue eggs as green eggs**.  
So,  
$$
\text{Blue eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10
$$

---

### Step 3: Pink Eggs  
She had **one fewer pink egg than blue eggs**.  
So,  
$$
\text{Pink eggs} = 10 - 1 = 9
$$

---

### Step 4: Yellow Eggs  
She had **one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs**.  
So,  
$$
\text{Yellow eggs} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
$$

---

### Step 5: Total Eggs  
Now, add up all the eggs:

$$
\text{Total eggs} = \text{Green} + \text{Blue} + \text{Pink} + \text{Yellow}
$$
$$
= 5 + 10 + 9 + 3 = 27
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{27}
$$

Cindy had **27 eggs** altogether.

   - Total money now: $40 + $100 = **$140**

3. **She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each.**  
   - Cost of two pairs: 2 × $30 = **$60**

4. **She also buys a bag for $20.**  
   - Total cost of items: $60 (jeans) + $20 (bag) = **$80**

5. **Subtract the total cost from her total money.**  
   - Money left: $140 − $80 = **$60**

### ✅ Final Answer: **$60**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many chocolate bars Boris produces in the **fourth week**.

---

### Step 1: First Week
Boris produces:
$$
8,000 \text{ bars}
$$

---

### Step 2: Second Week
He produces **half as much** as the first week:
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 8,000 = 4,000 \text{ bars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Third Week
He produces **three times as much** as the first week:
$$
3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total Production for the First Three Weeks
Add up the production from the first three weeks:
$$
8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
$$

---

### Step 5: Total Monthly Production
Boris produces a total of:
$$
50,000 \text{ bars per month}
$$

---

### Step 6: Fourth Week Production
Subtract the total of the first three weeks from the monthly total:
$$
50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{14,000} \text{ bars}
$$

So, **Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with **4 weeks**.

---

### 1. **Video Recording Time**
- She records **18 videos per week**, and each video is **4 minutes long**.
- So, weekly video recording time:
  $$
  18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes/week}
  $$

---

### 2. **Writing Songs**
- She spends **2 hours per week** writing songs.
- Convert hours to minutes:
  $$
  2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes/week}
  $$

---

### 3. **Makeup Time**
- She does makeup for **15 minutes, 6 days a week**.
- Weekly makeup time:
  $$
  15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ minutes/week}
  $$

---

### 4. **Total Weekly Time Spent on TikTok**
Add up all the weekly activities:
$$
72 \text{ (videos)} + 120 \text{ (writing)} + 90 \text{ (makeup)} = 282 \text{ minutes/week}
$$

---

### 5. **Monthly Time (4 Weeks)**
Multiply the weekly total by 4:
$$
282 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 = 1128 \text{ minutes/month}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Britany spends 1128 minutes on TikTok in a month with four weeks.**

If you want it in **hours**, divide by 60:
$$
1128 \div 60 = 18.8 \text{ hours}
$$

So, she spends **about 18.8 hours** on TikTok each month.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find the total cost for Angela.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the base installation package**

The firm offers a **base installation** for **$129.00**, which includes:

- 4 mirrors  
- 2 shelves  
- 1 chandelier  
- 10 pictures  

So, this base package covers **some of the items** Angela needs installed. Let’s check how many of each item she has and compare with the base package.

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many items Angela needs installed**

Angela has:

- **6 mirrors**  
- **2 chandeliers**  
- **20 pictures**

She does **not mention** having any shelves, so we can assume she doesn’t need them installed.

---

### **Step 3: Compare with the base package**

Base package includes:

- 4 mirrors  
- 2 shelves  
- 1 chandelier  
- 10 pictures  

Angela has:

- 6 mirrors → 2 extra mirrors  
- 2 chandeliers → 1 extra chandelier  
- 20 pictures → 10 extra pictures  
- No shelves → no extra shelves needed

So, Angela needs **additional items** beyond what is included in the base package.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the number of additional items**

From the above:

- Extra mirrors: 6 - 4 = **2**
- Extra chandeliers: 2 - 1 = **1**
- Extra pictures: 20 - 10 = **10**

Total **extra items**: 2 + 1 + 10 = **13 items**

---

### **Step 5: Cost calculation**

- Base installation: **$129.00**  
- Additional items: **13 items × $15.00 per item = $195.00**

---

### **Step 6: Total cost**

$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{Base cost} + \text{Additional items cost}
$$
$$
= 129 + 195 = \boxed{\$324}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: $324.00**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how much Eva has saved
We are told:

> **Eva has saved $20.00**

So,

$$
\text{Eva} = \$20.00
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how much Anthony has saved
We are told:

> **Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva**

So,

$$
\text{Anthony} = \text{Eva} + \$10.00 = \$20.00 + \$10.00 = \$30.00
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine how much Roy has saved
We are told:

> **Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony**

To find 40% more than Anthony’s amount, we calculate:

$$
\text{Roy} = \text{Anthony} + (40\% \times \text{Anthony}) = \$30.00 + (0.40 \times \$30.00)
$$

$$
= \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$42.00}
$$

Roy has saved **\$42.00**.
We are given a series of proportional relationships between how much each person can lift. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationships

We are told:

- **Naruto** can lift a mountain **10 times higher** than **Kagiyami**.
- **Kagiyami** can lift a mountain **4 times higher** than **Saskay**.
- **Saskay** can lift a mountain **12 times higher** than **Pompei**.
- **Pompei** can lift a mountain **1 inch**.

We need to find out **how high Naruto can lift a mountain**, in **feet**.

---

### Step 2: Work from the smallest to the largest

Start with **Pompei**:
- Pompei = **1 inch**

Now, **Saskay** can lift a mountain **12 times higher** than Pompei:
- Saskay = 12 × Pompei = 12 × 1 inch = **12 inches**

Next, **Kagiyami** can lift a mountain **4 times higher** than Saskay:
- Kagiyami = 4 × Saskay = 4 × 12 inches = **48 inches**

Finally, **Naruto** can lift a mountain **10 times higher** than Kagiyami:
- Naruto = 10 × Kagiyami = 10 × 48 inches = **480 inches**

---

### Step 3: Convert inches to feet

There are **12 inches in a foot**, so:

$$
\text{Naruto} = \frac{480}{12} = 40 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the distance traveled in the first part of the journey
Mason is biking at a rate of **8 miles per hour** for **4 hours**.

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 8 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 32 \, \text{miles}
$$

### Step 2: Determine the distance traveled in the second part of the journey
After resting, Mason continues his journey for another **6 hours** at the same speed of **8 mph**.

$$
\text{Distance} = 8 \, \text{mph} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 48 \, \text{miles}
$$

### Step 3: Add both distances to find the total distance
$$
\text{Total Distance} = 32 \, \text{miles} + 48 \, \text{miles} = \boxed{80} \, \text{miles}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles.**
We are given:

- 3 kangaroos travel at the same speed.
- It takes them **18 hours** to travel across a highway.
- We need to find how long it will take **4 turtles**, each traveling at **half the speed of a kangaroo**, to do the same.

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between time, speed, and distance

The basic formula is:

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
$$

Let’s define:

- $ v_k $ = speed of one kangaroo
- $ v_t = \frac{v_k}{2} $ = speed of one turtle
- Distance = same for all (let's call it $ D $)

---

### Step 2: Use the information about the kangaroos

3 kangaroos travel together at speed $ v_k $, and it takes them 18 hours. So the total distance $ D $ is:

$$
D = 3 \times v_k \times 18
$$

$$
D = 54 v_k
$$

So the **total distance** across the highway is $ 54 v_k $.

---

### Step 3: Now calculate how long it would take 4 turtles to cover the same distance

Each turtle travels at $ \frac{v_k}{2} $, so the combined speed of 4 turtles is:

$$
4 \times \frac{v_k}{2} = 2 v_k
$$

Now we use the distance formula again:

$$
D = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
$$

We know $ D = 54 v_k $ and the combined speed is $ 2 v_k $, so:

$$
54 v_k = 2 v_k \times t
$$

Divide both sides by $ 2 v_k $:

$$
t = \frac{54 v_k}{2 v_k} = \frac{54}{2} = 27
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{27} \text{ hours}
$$

It will take **27 hours** for 4 turtles to cross the highway.
We are given the following information:

- Kora made **20** clay dishes.
- Rory made **20 more** clay dishes than Kora.
- Jada made **twice as many** clay dishes as Rory.

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find how many dishes Rory made

Rory made 20 more than Kora:

$$
\text{Rory} = \text{Kora} + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many dishes Jada made

Jada made twice as many as Rory:

$$
\text{Jada} = 2 \times \text{Rory} = 2 \times 40 = 80
$$

---

### Step 3: Add up all the dishes

Now, add the number of dishes made by each person:

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Kora} + \text{Rory} + \text{Jada} = 20 + 40 + 80 = 140
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{140}
$$

So, **Jada, Rory, and Kora made a total of 140 clay dishes together.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much money Erika has in her purse.

---

### 1. **Cost of the laptop:**
- Original price: **$600**
- Trade-in discount: **$200**
- So, the final price after trade-in:  
  $$
  600 - 200 = 400
  $$

---

### 2. **How much she needs to buy the laptop:**
- She only needs an extra **$50**.
- That means she already has:
  $$
  400 - 50 = 350
  $$
  dollars in total (from savings, job, and her mom).

---

### 3. **Sources of money:**
We are told:

- She was paid **$150** from her part-time job.
- Her mom gives her **$80**.
- She also has **some savings in her purse**.

So, the total amount she has from these sources is:
$$
150 + 80 = 230
$$

---

### 4. **How much she has in her purse:**
She needs a total of **$350** to buy the laptop, and she has **$230** from her job and her mom.

So, the amount she must have in her purse is:
$$
350 - 230 = \boxed{120}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Erika has $120 in her purse.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of apple slices
- Each **large apple** can be sliced into **5 pieces**.
- Each **small apple** can be sliced into **3 pieces**.

Adam slices:
- **3 large apples**:  
  $ 3 \times 5 = 15 $ slices

- **5 small apples**:  
  $ 5 \times 3 = 15 $ slices

So, the **total number of slices** is:  
$$
15 + 15 = 30 \text{ slices}
$$

### Step 2: Subtract the number of slices Adam eats
Adam eats **15 slices**.

### Step 3: Find the number of slices left
$$
30 - 15 = 15
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**15 apple slices are left.**
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how much milk the farmer currently produces
- The farmer has **3 cows**.
- Each cow gives **5 liters** of milk per day.
- So, total milk produced per day =  
  $$
  3 \text{ cows} \times 5 \text{ liters/cow} = 15 \text{ liters}
  $$

### Step 2: Find out how much more milk is needed
- The farmer wants to produce **25 liters** of milk per day.
- He already produces **15 liters**, so he needs:
  $$
  25 \text{ liters} - 15 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters more}
  $$

### Step 3: Determine how many more cows are needed
- Each cow produces **5 liters** of milk per day.
- To get **10 more liters**, he needs:
  $$
  \frac{10 \text{ liters}}{5 \text{ liters/cow}} = 2 \text{ cows}
  $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
The farmer needs **2 more cows** to produce 25 liters of milk a day.
We are given:

- Each glue stick is originally **12 millimeters long**.
- Patrick has **three partially used** glue sticks with the following amounts **left**:
  - First: $ \frac{1}{6} $ of the original length
  - Second: $ \frac{2}{3} $ of the original length
  - Third: $ \frac{1}{2} $ of the original length

We are asked to find the **total length of the glue sticks that are not used**.

---

### Step 1: Understand what "not used" means

The question asks for the **length that is not used**, which means we need to calculate the **unused portion** of each glue stick.

Since the total length of each stick is **12 mm**, and a fraction is left, the unused portion is:

$$
\text{Unused length} = \text{Total length} - \text{Used length}
$$

But since we are only told how much is **left**, that is the **used** portion. So:

$$
\text{Used length} = \text{Fraction left} \times 12
$$

Then, the **unused** portion would be:

$$
\text{Unused length} = 12 - (\text{Fraction left} \times 12)
$$

Alternatively, since we want the **total unused length**, we can compute:

$$
\text{Total unused length} = 12 \times (1 - \text{Fraction left})
$$

Let’s apply this to each stick.

---

### Step 2: Compute unused length for each stick

#### First glue stick: $ \frac{1}{6} $ left

$$
\text{Unused} = 12 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{6}\right) = 12 \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ mm}
$$

#### Second glue stick: $ \frac{2}{3} $ left

$$
\text{Unused} = 12 \times \left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) = 12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4 \text{ mm}
$$

#### Third glue stick: $ \frac{1}{2} $ left

$$
\text{Unused} = 12 \times \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 12 \times \frac{1}{2} = 6 \text{ mm}
$$

---

### Step 3: Add up the unused lengths

$$
\text{Total unused length} = 10 + 4 + 6 = \boxed{20} \text{ mm}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{20} \text{ millimeters}

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total cost of the items Gabriel wants to buy:**
   - Car: $10,000  
   - Phone: $800  
   - **Total = $10,000 + $800 = $10,800**

2. **Money Gabriel already has:**
   - From working on weekends: $5,000  
   - From his brother: $200  
   - **Total money he has = $5,000 + $200 = $5,200**

3. **Money Gabriel still needs:**
   - **Total cost – Money he has = $10,800 – $5,200 = $5,600**

### ✅ Final Answer: Gabriel still needs **$5,600**.
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Cost of the hat**: $70  
2. **Amount Thea gave**: 4 × $20 = $80  
3. **Change received** = Amount given − Cost of the hat  
   = $80 − $70 = **$10**

So, Thea received **$10** in change. ✅
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate how much money Craig has initially

### Step 1: Understand the given information

We are told:

- **Jack collected 60 dishes.**
- **Peter has twice as many socks as Jack.**
- **Peter has half as many dishes as Jack.**
- **Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store.**

Our goal is to find the **total number of socks and dishes that Peter and Jack have together**.

---

### Step 2: Define variables

Let’s define some variables:

- Let **S_J** = number of **socks Jack has**
- Let **D_J** = number of **dishes Jack has** = **60** (given)
- Let **S_P** = number of **socks Peter has**
- Let **D_P** = number of **dishes Peter has**

---

### Step 3: Use the relationships

#### From the problem:

1. **Peter has twice as many socks as Jack:**  
   $$
   S_P = 2 \times S_J
   $$

2. **Peter has half as many dishes as Jack:**  
   $$
   D_P = \frac{1}{2} \times D_J = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30
   $$

3. **Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store:**  
   This means:
   $$
   D_J = 2 \times S_J
   $$

   We already know $ D_J = 60 $, so:
   $$
   60 = 2 \times S_J \Rightarrow S_J = 30
   $$

---

### Step 4: Plug in values

Now we can find all the unknowns:

- $ S_J = 30 $
- $ S_P = 2 \times S_J = 2 \times 30 = 60 $
- $ D_J = 60 $
- $ D_P = 30 $

---

### Step 5: Find total number of socks and dishes

Total socks = $ S_J + S_P = 30 + 60 = 90 $  
Total dishes = $ D_J + D_P = 60 + 30 = 90 $

So, **total number of socks and dishes they have together** is:

$$
90 + 90 = \boxed{180}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **180**
We are given the following information:

- Total number of students = 20  
- Number of students good at **math only** = 5  
- Number of students good at **English only** = 8  
- The rest are good at **both math and English**

### Step 1: Find the number of students good at both subjects

We can find the number of students who are good at **both** by subtracting those who are good at only one subject from the total.

$$
\text{Students good at both} = \text{Total} - (\text{Math only} + \text{English only})
$$
$$
= 20 - (5 + 8) = 20 - 13 = 7
$$

So, **7 students are good at both math and English**.

### Step 2: Find how many are good at math

Students who are good at **math** include:
- Those good at **math only**
- Those good at **both math and English**

$$
\text{Students good at math} = \text{Math only} + \text{Both}
$$
$$
= 5 + 7 = 12
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{12}
$$

**12 students are good at math.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many groups can perform in the 2-hour concert.

---

### **1. Total duration of the concert:**
- The concert lasts **2 hours**.
- Convert that to minutes:  
  $$
  2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes}
  $$

---

### **2. Time per group:**
Each group requires:
- **2 minutes** to get on stage  
- **6 minutes** to perform  
- **2 minutes** to exit  

So, total time per group is:  
$$
2 + 6 + 2 = 10 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **3. Intermission:**
There is a **10-minute intermission**, which is not used for performance time.

---

### **4. Total available time for performances:**
$$
120 \text{ minutes (total)} - 10 \text{ minutes (intermission)} = 110 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **5. Number of groups that can perform:**
Now divide the available performance time by the time per group:

$$
\frac{110}{10} = 11
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{11} \text{ groups}
$$

So, **11 groups** can perform in the concert.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the problem**

Brenda invests **$300** into a scheme that earns **simple interest**, and the rate of interest is given as:

> **"three-quarters of the original amount per year"**

This means the **annual interest rate** is:

$$
\text{Interest Rate} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Original Amount}
$$

So, for an investment of $300, the **annual interest** is:

$$
\text{Annual Interest} = \frac{3}{4} \times 300 = 225
$$

So, each year, Brenda earns **$225** in interest.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total interest over 3 years**

Since it's **simple interest**, the interest earned each year is the same.

$$
\text{Total Interest} = \text{Annual Interest} \times \text{Number of Years}
= 225 \times 3 = 675
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add the total interest to the original principal**

$$
\text{Total Amount after 3 years} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total Interest}
= 300 + 675 = 975
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$975}
$$
We are given the following information:

- Total **white shirts** = 40  
- Total **floral shirts** = 50  
- Half of the white shirts have **collars** → So, **20 white shirts have collars**, and **20 white shirts have no collars**.  
- **20 of the floral shirts have buttons** → So, **30 floral shirts have no buttons**.

Now, the question asks:

> **How many more floral shirts with no buttons are there than white shirts with no collars?**

### Step-by-step:

1. **White shirts with no collars**:  
   Since half of the 40 white shirts have collars, then:  
   $$
   \text{White shirts with no collars} = 40 - 20 = 20
   $$

2. **Floral shirts with no buttons**:  
   Since 20 out of 50 floral shirts have buttons, then:  
   $$
   \text{Floral shirts with no buttons} = 50 - 20 = 30
   $$

3. **Difference**:  
   Now subtract the number of white shirts with no collars from the number of floral shirts with no buttons:  
   $$
   30 - 20 = 10
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{10}
$$

There are **10 more floral shirts with no buttons** than white shirts with no collars.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many trays the farmer uses
- The farmer has **900 eggs**.
- Each tray holds **30 eggs**.

$$
\text{Number of trays} = \frac{900}{30} = 30 \text{ trays}
$$

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings
- He sells each tray for **$2.50**.

$$
\text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times \$2.50 = \$75
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
The farmer will earn **\$75**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Initial number of goats in each farm
- **Farm X**: 55 goats  
- **Farm Y**: 45 goats  

### Step 2: Goats sold from each farm
- From Farm X, Mr. Smith sold **10 goats**.
- From Farm Y, he sold **twice as many as from Farm X**, so:
  $$
  2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ goats}
  $$

### Step 3: Calculate remaining goats in each farm
- **Farm X**:  
  $$
  55 - 10 = 45 \text{ goats left}
  $$
- **Farm Y**:  
  $$
  45 - 20 = 25 \text{ goats left}
  $$

### Step 4: Total goats left in both farms
$$
45 + 25 = 70
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**70 goats are left in the two farms altogether.**
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Find how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year.
James buys **2 pairs of shoes per month**.

There are **12 months in a year**, so:

$$
2 \text{ pairs/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ pairs/year}
$$

### Step 2: Find the total cost for the year.
He spends **$2640 on shoes each year**.

### Step 3: Find the average cost per pair of shoes.
To find the average cost per pair, divide the total amount spent by the number of pairs:

$$
\frac{2640}{24} = 110
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**James pays an average of $110 for each pair of shoes.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the prices
- **Green food basket:** $25 each  
- **Red food basket:** $18 each, but you get **$2 off** per red basket

### Step 2: Determine how many of each you're buying
You are told:
> "If you buy 3 baskets of green food and red food..."

This means:
- You are buying **3 baskets total**, consisting of **some number of green** and **some number of red** baskets.

But we don't know exactly how many of each. However, the question is likely asking for a general case where you buy **3 baskets in total**, with some being green and some being red. But to be clear, let's assume:

> You are buying **3 baskets total**, and they are split between green and red.

Let’s suppose you buy **x** green baskets and **y** red baskets such that:

$$
x + y = 3
$$

We can solve this for different combinations of x and y (i.e., different numbers of green and red baskets). Let’s try all possible combinations.

---

### Step 3: Try all possible combinations of green and red baskets (x + y = 3)

#### Case 1: 3 green, 0 red
- Green cost: 3 × $25 = $75  
- Red cost: 0 × ($18 - $2) = $0  
- **Total cost = $75**

#### Case 2: 2 green, 1 red
- Green cost: 2 × $25 = $50  
- Red cost: 1 × ($18 - $2) = $16  
- **Total cost = $50 + $16 = $66**

#### Case 3: 1 green, 2 red
- Green cost: 1 × $25 = $25  
- Red cost: 2 × ($18 - $2) = 2 × $16 = $32  
- **Total cost = $25 + $32 = $57**

#### Case 4: 0 green, 3 red
- Green cost: 0 × $25 = $0  
- Red cost: 3 × ($18 - $2) = 3 × $16 = $48  
- **Total cost = $48**

---

### Step 4: Final Answer

Since the question says:  
> "If you buy 3 baskets of green food and red food..."

It doesn’t specify how many of each, so the answer depends on the split. However, if we interpret it as buying **3 baskets in total**, then the total cost varies depending on how many are green or red.

So, the **total amount you have to pay** will be **between $48 and $75**, depending on how many red baskets you buy (since red baskets give a discount).

If you want a specific answer, please clarify how many of each color you are buying.

---

### ✅ Final Answer (assuming 3 baskets total, and you’re buying all red):

If you buy **3 red baskets**, then:

- Each red basket costs $18 – $2 = **$16**
- Total cost = 3 × $16 = **$48**

So, the **minimum total cost** is **$48**.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of rooms
There are **90 rooms** at the KozyInn Motel.

### Step 2: Find half of the rooms
We want to clean **one-half** of the rooms:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 90 = 45 \text{ rooms}
$$

### Step 3: Time to clean one room
It takes **20 minutes** to clean **one room**.

### Step 4: Time to clean 45 rooms
Now, multiply the time per room by the number of rooms:

$$
45 \times 20 = 900 \text{ minutes}
$$

### Step 5: Convert minutes to hours
There are **60 minutes in an hour**, so:

$$
\frac{900}{60} = 15 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**15 hours** would be needed to clean one-half of the rooms.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Year 1:
They build **12 homes**.

### Year 2:
They build **three times** the number of homes from Year 1.  
So:  
$$
3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ homes}
$$

### Year 3:
They **double the total number of homes built in the first two years**.  
First, find the total for the first two years:  
$$
12 + 36 = 48 \text{ homes}
$$  
Now double that:  
$$
2 \times 48 = 96 \text{ homes}
$$

### Total over three years:
Add up all the homes built each year:  
$$
12 + 36 + 96 = 144 \text{ homes}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**144 homes** will be built over the next three years.
Let's solve this step by step using algebra.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s assign a variable to **your age**:

- Let **x** = your age

Now use the information given to express the ages of your brother and sister in terms of **x**:

- You are **3 years younger than your brother**, so:
  - Brother's age = **x + 3**

- You are **2 years older than your sister**, so:
  - Sister's age = **x - 2**

- Your mom's age is **one less than three times your brother's age**, so:
  - Mom's age = **3(x + 3) - 1**

---

### Step 2: Add all the ages

We’re told that when you add **all your ages**, the total is **87**. So:

$$
\text{Your age} + \text{Brother's age} + \text{Sister's age} + \text{Mom's age} = 87
$$

Substitute each expression:

$$
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87
$$

---

### Step 3: Simplify the equation

First, simplify inside the brackets:

$$
3(x + 3) - 1 = 3x + 9 - 1 = 3x + 8
$$

Now substitute back into the equation:

$$
x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + (3x + 8) = 87
$$

Combine like terms:

$$
x + x + 3 + x - 2 + 3x + 8 = 87
$$

Add the x terms:  
$$
x + x + x + 3x = 6x
$$

Add the constants:  
$$
3 - 2 + 8 = 9
$$

So the equation becomes:

$$
6x + 9 = 87
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for x

$$
6x = 87 - 9 = 78
$$

$$
x = \frac{78}{6} = 13
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**You are 13 years old.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many glue sticks are needed
Mr. Jackson has **27 students**, and each student needs **2 glue sticks**.

$$
27 \text{ students} \times 2 \text{ glue sticks per student} = 54 \text{ glue sticks}
$$

### Step 2: Determine how many packs of glue sticks are needed
Each pack contains **8 glue sticks**.

We need to find out how many **whole packs** Mr. Jackson must buy so that he has **at least 54 glue sticks**.

To do this, divide the total number of glue sticks needed by the number of glue sticks per pack:

$$
\frac{54}{8} = 6.75
$$

Since Mr. Jackson can only buy **whole packs**, we round **up** to the next whole number:

$$
\text{Number of packs needed} = 7
$$

### Step 3: Verify the result
If he buys **7 packs**, then:

$$
7 \text{ packs} \times 8 \text{ glue sticks per pack} = 56 \text{ glue sticks}
$$

He will have **56 glue sticks**, which is more than enough for the **54** needed, and there will be **2 extra** glue sticks left over.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.**
Let's break down the problem step by step:

---

### **Given:**

- **Initial amount of water (Day 0):** 4000 gallons  
- **After a day of heavy rain (Day 1):** The amount **doubles**, so it becomes:
  $$
  4000 \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
  $$

- **On the third day (Day 3):** The volume **increases by 6000 gallons** from the previous day.

We need to find the **total amount of water passing through the river at that point**. However, we are not told whether this refers to:

- The **total over multiple days**, or
- Just the **amount on a specific day** (probably Day 3).

Assuming the question is asking for the **amount on Day 3**, let’s proceed with that interpretation.

---

### **Step-by-step Calculation:**

- **Day 0:** 4000 gallons  
- **Day 1:** Doubles → $ 4000 \times 2 = 8000 $ gallons  
- **Day 2:** Not specified, but we know that on **Day 3**, the volume increases by 6000 gallons from **Day 2**.

So:
$$
\text{Volume on Day 3} = \text{Volume on Day 2} + 6000
$$

But we don’t have the volume on Day 2 directly. However, we can assume that the increase on Day 3 is from **Day 2**, and if no other changes are mentioned between Day 1 and Day 2, then:

- **Day 2 = Day 1 = 8000 gallons**
- Then:
  $$
  \text{Volume on Day 3} = 8000 + 6000 = 14000 \text{ gallons}
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{14000} \text{ gallons}
$$

This is the **total amount of water passing through the river at that point on the third day**.
We are told that:

- On **Day 0**, there are **10 infected people**.
- Every day, **each infected person infects 6 others**.

We need to find how many people are **infected after 3 days**.

---

### Step-by-step breakdown:

#### Day 0:
- Infected people = **10**

#### Day 1:
- Each of the 10 infected people infects **6 new people**.
- New infections = $ 10 \times 6 = 60 $
- Total infected = $ 10 + 60 = 70 $

#### Day 2:
- Now there are **70 infected people**.
- Each of these 70 infects 6 new people.
- New infections = $ 70 \times 6 = 420 $
- Total infected = $ 70 + 420 = 490 $

#### Day 3:
- Now there are **490 infected people**.
- Each of these 490 infects 6 new people.
- New infections = $ 490 \times 6 = 2940 $
- Total infected = $ 490 + 2940 = 3430 $

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**3430 people are infected after 3 days.**
Let's break this problem down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Calculate how much Rafaela received in tips

- Rafaela had **40 customers**.
- Each customer gave a **$20 tip**.

$$
\text{Rafaela's tips} = 40 \times 20 = 800
$$

So, **Rafaela received $800 in tips**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate how much Julieta received in tips

- Julieta received **10% less** than Rafaela.

First, find 10% of Rafaela’s tips:

$$
10\% \text{ of } 800 = 0.10 \times 800 = 80
$$

Now subtract that from Rafaela’s total:

$$
\text{Julieta's tips} = 800 - 80 = 720
$$

So, **Julieta received $720 in tips**.

---

### Step 3: Add their tips together to find the total

$$
\text{Total tips} = 800 + 720 = 1520
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{1520}
$$

**Julieta and Rafaela received a total of $1,520 in tips.**
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Total oranges Jennifer bought:**  
   $ 12 $

2. **Oranges given to her three daughters:**  
   Each daughter got 2 oranges, so:  
   $ 3 \text{ daughters} \times 2 \text{ oranges each} = 6 \text{ oranges} $

3. **Oranges given to her only son:**  
   $ 3 \text{ oranges} $

4. **Total oranges given away:**  
   $ 6 \text{ (daughters)} + 3 \text{ (son)} = 9 \text{ oranges} $

5. **Oranges remaining with Jennifer:**  
   $ 12 - 9 = 3 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **3 oranges**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many badges Claire earns in a year

- Claire earns **1 badge per month**.
- In **1 year**, there are **12 months**.
  
$$
\text{Claire's badges in a year} = 1 \times 12 = 12 \text{ badges}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many badges Amber earns in a year

- It takes **Amber twice as long** to earn a badge than Claire.
- So, if Claire earns 1 badge in 1 month, it takes Amber **2 months** to earn 1 badge.
- That means Amber earns **half the number of badges** that Claire earns in the same time frame.

$$
\text{Amber's badges in a year} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ badges}
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine how many badges Wendy earns in a year

- Wendy earns **three times the amount of badges** as Claire in the same time frame.

$$
\text{Wendy's badges in a year} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ badges}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find how many more badges Wendy earns compared to Amber

$$
\text{Difference} = \text{Wendy's badges} - \text{Amber's badges} = 36 - 6 = 30
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{30}
$$

Wendy earns **30 more badges** than Amber in a year.
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many hours Paige baked**
She baked from **1:00 PM to 6:00 PM**, which is:

$$
6:00 - 1:00 = 5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 2: How many loaves does she bake per hour?**

Paige bakes **2 banana bread loaves per hour**.

So in 5 hours, she bakes:

$$
2 \text{ loaves/hour} \times 5 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ loaves}
$$

---

### **Step 3: How many slices per loaf?**

Each loaf is cut into **8 slices**.

So total number of slices is:

$$
10 \text{ loaves} \times 8 \text{ slices/loaf} = 80 \text{ slices}
$$

---

### **Step 4: How much money is raised per slice?**

Each slice is sold for **$0.50**.

So total money raised is:

$$
80 \text{ slices} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/slice} = 40 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{40} \text{ dollars}
$$
We are told:

- Gretchen has **some coins**.
- There are **30 more gold coins than silver coins**.
- She has **70 gold coins**.

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Let the number of **silver coins** be $ S $.

Then, the number of **gold coins** is:
$$
G = S + 30
$$

We are told that Gretchen has **70 gold coins**, so:
$$
S + 30 = 70

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### 1. **Total number of burritos ordered:**
George ordered **600 burritos**.

---

### 2. **Number of students and burritos per student:**
There are **50 students**, and each student was given **10 burritos**.

So, the total number of burritos given to students is:

$$
50 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ burritos/student} = 500 \text{ burritos}
$$

---

### 3. **Burritos eaten by Mr. George:**
Mr. George ate **20 burritos**.

---

### 4. **Total burritos used:**
Add the burritos given to students and the ones eaten by Mr. George:

$$
500 + 20 = 520 \text{ burritos}
$$

---

### 5. **Leftover burritos:**
Subtract the total burritos used from the total burritos ordered:

$$
600 - 520 = 80 \text{ burritos}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{80}
$$

So, there were **80 leftover burritos** from the picnic.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Number of red cars  
We are told:

> There are **12 red cars**.

So,

$$
\text{Red cars} = 12
$$

---

### Step 2: Number of green cars  
We are told:

> They have **2 fewer green cars than red cars**.

So,

$$
\text{Green cars} = \text{Red cars} - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10
$$

---

### Step 3: Number of blue cars  
We are told:

> They have **3 times the number of blue cars as green cars**.

So,

$$
\text{Blue cars} = 3 \times \text{Green cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
$$

---

### Step 4: Total number of cars  
We are told:

> The rink has **75 cars in total**.

So, we can find the number of yellow cars by subtracting the number of red, green, and blue cars from the total.

$$
\text{Yellow cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Red} + \text{Green} + \text{Blue})
$$

$$
\text{Yellow cars} = 75 - (12 + 10 + 30) = 75 - 52 = 23
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{23}
$$

There are **23 yellow cars**.
We are given the following information:

- Together, **Sofie**, **Anne**, and **Fawn** have **85 books**.
- **Sofie has 25 more books than Anne.**
- **Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn.**

We are asked to find how many books **Fawn** has.

---

### Step 1: Define Variables

Let:
- $ A $ = number of books Anne has
- $ S $ = number of books Sofie has
- $ F $ = number of books Fawn has

From the problem:

1. $ S = A + 25 $ (Sofie has 25 more books than Anne)
2. $ A = F - 12 $ (Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn)
3. $ S + A + F = 85 $ (Total number of books)

---

### Step 2: Substitute Expressions

From equation (2):  
$ A = F - 12 $

Substitute into equation (1):  
$ S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13 $

Now substitute both $ S $ and $ A $ in terms of $ F $ into the total:

$$
S + A + F = (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
$$

Simplify:

$$
F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85 \\
3F + 1 = 85
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ F $

$$
3F + 1 = 85 \\
3F = 84 \\
F = 28
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Fawn has 28 books.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Weight of potatoes**:  
   Daisy bought a bag of potatoes that weighed **5 pounds**.

2. **Weight of sweet potatoes**:  
   The sweet potatoes weighed **2 times as much as the potatoes**.  
   So,  
   $$
   \text{Weight of sweet potatoes} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ pounds}
   $$

3. **Weight of carrots**:  
   The carrots weighed **3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes**.  
   So,  
   $$
   \text{Weight of carrots} = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ pounds}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.**
Let's solve this step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many jello cups are needed**

Greg wants to give **4 jello cups** to each of the **30 kids**.

$$
\text{Total jello cups needed} = 30 \text{ kids} \times 4 \text{ cups per kid} = 120 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many boxes of jello are needed**

Each **3-ounce box** makes **10 jello cups**.

$$
\text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{120 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ cups per box}} = 12 \text{ boxes}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total cost**

Each box costs **$1.25**.

$$
\text{Total cost} = 12 \text{ boxes} \times \$1.25 \text{ per box} = \$15.00

2. **Determine how much money the seller gave:**

   The seller gave $4000 in dollar bills.

3. **Calculate the change to be given back:**

   Subtract the total cost from the amount paid:

   $$
   4000 - 3500 = 500
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
The seller will give back **$500** in change.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Total monthly cost
They spend **$400 per month** on groceries.

### Step 2: Madeline's share
Madeline pays **60%** of the total cost.  
So, her share is:
$$
0.60 \times 400 = 240
$$

### Step 3: Keenan's share
Since Madeline pays $240, Keenan pays the remaining:
$$
400 - 240 = 160
$$

### Step 4: Keenan's weekly cost
The question asks how much **Keenan spends per week**, and it's a **four-week month**, so:
$$
\frac{160}{4} = 40
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Keenan spends $40 per week.**
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Total number of pizza pieces
Tobias bought a pizza with **60 pieces**.

---

### Step 2: Pieces eaten on the first day

He ate **2/5** of the pizza on the first day.

$$
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ pieces}
$$

So, after Day 1, he has eaten **24 pieces**.

---

### Step 3: Pieces remaining after Day 1

$$
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces remaining}
$$

---

### Step 4: Pieces eaten on the second day

He ate **10 pieces** on the second day.

$$
36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces remaining}
$$

So far, he has eaten:

$$
24 + 10 = 34 \text{ pieces}
$$

---

### Step 5: Pieces eaten on the third day

He ate **7/13** of the remaining pieces on the third day.

Remaining before Day 3: **26 pieces**

$$
\frac{7}{13} \times 26 = 14 \text{ pieces}
$$

So, on Day 3, he ate **14 pieces**.

---

### Step 6: Total pieces eaten so far

$$
24 \text{ (Day 1)} + 10 \text{ (Day 2)} + 14 \text{ (Day 3)} = 48 \text{ pieces}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{48}
$$

Tobias has eaten **48 pieces** so far.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Find the cost of one bottle of soda
We are told that **7 bottles of soda cost $21.00**.

So, the cost of **one bottle of soda** is:

$$

So, **1 bottle of water costs $2.00**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for David
David wants to buy:
- **3 bottles of soda**
- **2 bottles of water**

Total cost:

$$
(3 \times 3.00) + (2 \times 2.00) = 9.00 + 4.00 = 13.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$13.00}
$$
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find the total cost of the bolts**

David wants to buy **16 bolts**, and each bolt costs **$0.03**.

$$
\text{Total cost} = 16 \times 0.03 = 0.48
$$

So, the total cost of the bolts is **$0.48**.

---

### **Step 2: Subtract the total cost from David's money**

David has **$12.48**.

$$
\text{Money left} = 12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$12.00}
$$

David has **$12.00 left** after buying the bolts.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Find Ella's hourly rate
Ella earned **$33** for **3 hours** of dog walking.

So, her hourly rate is:

$$
\text{Hourly rate} = \frac{\$33}{3 \text{ hours}} = \$11 \text{ per hour}
$$

### Step 2: Calculate earnings for 12 hours
Now we know she earns **$11 per hour**, so for **12 hours**, she would earn:

$$
\text{Total earnings} = 12 \text{ hours} \times \$11/\text{hour} = \$132
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:

---

### Step 1: Initial number of marbles
Paul starts with **52 marbles**.

---

### Step 2: Marbles given by his friend
His friend gives him **28 more marbles**.

So, total marbles now =  
$$
52 + 28 = 80
$$

---

### Step 3: Marbles lost
Paul **loses 1/4** of his marbles.

First, find 1/4 of 80:
$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20
$$

So, he loses **20 marbles**.

---

### Step 4: Marbles left
Subtract the lost marbles from the total:
$$
80 - 20 = 60
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{60}
$$

Paul has **60 marbles left**.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

We are given the following information:

- Isaias wants to make a **profit of $2000**.
- He sells chickens at **$50 per chicken**.
- He has **300 chickens** on his farm.
- He plans to sell **3/5** of them.
- We are asked: **For how much money did Isaias buy the chickens he took to the market for sale?**

---

### Step 1: Determine how many chickens Isaias is selling

He plans to sell $ \frac{3}{5} $ of the 300 chickens:

$$
\text{Number of chickens sold} = \frac{3}{5} \times 300 = 180
$$

So, Isaias is selling **180 chickens**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate total revenue from selling the chickens

He sells each chicken for $50:

$$
\text{Revenue} = 180 \times 50 = 9000
$$

So, he gets **$9000** from selling the chickens.

---

### Step 3: Use the profit to find the cost price

Profit = Revenue - Cost Price

We know:

- Profit = $2000
- Revenue = $9000

So,

$$
\text{Cost Price} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Profit} = 9000 - 2000 = 7000
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{7000}
$$

Isaias bought the chickens he took to the market for **$7000**.
We are told:

- Total glasses sold = 32  
- Julie sold = 14 glasses  
- The **boys** (Micah and Mitchell) sold an **equal number** of glasses.  
- We need to find: **How many more glasses did Julie sell than Micah?**

---

### Step 1: Find how many glasses the boys sold together

Since Julie sold 14 glasses, the boys must have sold:

$$
32 - 14 = 18 \text{ glasses}
$$

---

### Step 2: Divide the boys' total equally between Micah and Mitchell

Micah and Mitchell sold an equal number of glasses, so:

$$
\frac{18}{2} = 9 \text{ glasses each}
$$

So, **Micah sold 9 glasses**.

---

### Step 3: Find how many more glasses Julie sold than Micah

$$
14 - 9 = 5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Julie sold 5 more glasses than Micah.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Hair cost**: Iris spent $400.

2. **Manicure cost**: She spent **1/4 as much** as she did on her hair.  
   So, the manicure cost is:  
   $$
   \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100
   $$

3. **Pedicure cost**: She spent **3/4 as much** as she did on her manicure.  
   The manicure was $100, so the pedicure cost is:  
   $$
   \frac{3}{4} \times 100 = 75
   $$

4. **Total amount spent at the spa**:  
   Add up all the amounts:  
   $$
   400 + 100 + 75 = 575
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$575**
Let's break this problem down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total amount Sarah will earn from selling the rope**

- Sarah has a **20-meter** rope.
- She sells it at **$2 per meter**.

$$
\text{Total money earned} = 20 \times 2 = \$40
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how much Sarah can buy with that money**

- The new rope costs **$1.5 per meter**.
- Sarah wants to use all of her $40 to buy as much rope as possible.

$$
\text{Meters of new rope she can buy} = \frac{40}{1.5} = \frac{80}{3} \approx 26.67 \text{ meters}
$$

But since she can only buy whole meters (unless partial meters are allowed), we'll assume she can buy **26 full meters** of the new rope, because:

$$
26 \times 1.5 = 39
$$

So, she spends **$39** on the new rope.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how much money is left over**

$$
\text{Money left} = 40 - 39 = \$1
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$1}
$$

Sarah will have **$1 left over** after buying the new rope.
We are given:

- In **10 years**, Melanie will be **18 years old**.

Let’s find her **current age** first.

---

### Step 1: Find Melanie's current age

If in 10 years she will be 18, then her **current age** is:

$$
\text{Current age} = 18 - 10 = 8 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine when her age will be **three times her present age**

Her **present age** is 8.  
So, we want to find how many years from now her age will be:

$$
3 \times 8 = 24
$$

So, we need to find the number of years $ x $ such that:

$$
\text{Current age} + x = 24
$$

Substitute her current age (which is 8):

$$
8 + x = 24
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
x = 24 - 8 = 16
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{16}
$$

In **16 years**, Melanie will be **24 years old**, which is **three times her current age**.
Let's break down the problem step by step to calculate how much Kelly has spent and how much money she has left from her $65 budget.

---

### 1. **Bacon**
- She has **5 packs of bacon**.
- Total cost for bacon = **$10**.

So, each pack of bacon costs:
$$
\frac{10}{5} = 2 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### 2. **Chicken**
- She has **6 packets of chicken**.
- Each packet of chicken costs **twice as much as a pack of bacon**.
- Since a pack of bacon is **$2**, then:
$$
\text{Cost of one chicken packet} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
$$
- Total cost for chicken:
$$
6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### 3. **Strawberries**
- She has **3 packs of strawberries**.
- Each pack costs **$4**.
- Total cost for strawberries:
$$
3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### 4. **Apples**
- She has **7 packs of apples**.
- Each pack of apples costs **half the price of a pack of strawberries**.
- A pack of strawberries is **$4**, so:
$$
\text{Cost of one apple pack} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ dollars}
$$
- Total cost for apples:
$$
7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### 5. **Total Cost**
Now, add up all the costs:

- Bacon: $10  
- Chicken: $24  
- Strawberries: $12  
- Apples: $14  

$$
\text{Total spent} = 10 + 24 + 12 + 14 = 60 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### 6. **Money Left in Budget**
Kelly’s total budget is **$65**.

$$
\text{Money left} = 65 - 60 = \boxed{5} \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{5} \text{ dollars}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Let the length of Elaina's usual concert be** $ x $ **minutes**.

2. The **final concert** is **twice as long** as a usual one, so its runtime is:
   $$
   2x
   $$

3. At the end, she performs a **15-minute encore**, so the **total runtime** of the final concert is:
   $$
   2x + 15
   $$

4. We're told that the total runtime of the final concert is **65 minutes**, so we can set up the equation:
   $$
   2x + 15 = 65
   $$

5. Solve for $ x $:
   $$
   2x = 65 - 15 \\
   2x = 50 \\
   x = \frac{50}{2} = 25
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Elaina's usual concerts run for **25 minutes**.

1. **Start with the total number of toys Argo has:**
   $$
   200 \text{ toys}
   $$

2. **Subtract the number of toys given to Alyssa:**
   $$
   200 - 40 = 160
   $$

3. **Subtract the number of toys given to Bonnie:**
   $$
   160 - 80 = 80
   $$

4. **Subtract the number of toys given to Nicky:**
   $$
   80 - 30 = 50
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Argo has 50 toys left.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Tuesday**: They make **125** chimichangas.  
2. **Wednesday**: They also make **125** chimichangas.  
3. **Friday**: They make **twice as many** as on Tuesday.  
   - So, on Friday:  
     $ 2 \times 125 = 250 $ chimichangas.

Now, let's add them all up:

$$
125 \ (\text{Tuesday}) + 125 \ (\text{Wednesday}) + 250 \ (\text{Friday}) = 500
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **500 chimichangas**.
We are told that a singer has **50 microphones**, and he wants to arrange them in **pairs** on a stage. However, after arranging the rest in pairs, **20% of the microphones won't find any space**.

Let's break this down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Understand what "20% of the microphones won't find any space" means

This means that **20% of the total microphones are not used** (i.e., they couldn’t be placed in pairs).

So:

$$
\text{Number of unused microphones} = 20\% \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
$$

That means **10 microphones were not used**.

---

### Step 2: Find the number of microphones that **were used**

$$
\text{Used microphones} = 50 - 10 = 40
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine how many **pairs** can be made from the used microphones

Since each pair consists of **2 microphones**, the number of pairs is:

$$
\text{Number of pairs} = \frac{\text{Used microphones}}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{20}
$$

The singer was able to arrange **20 pairs** of microphones on the stage.
Let's break the problem down step by step:

### 1. Birds nesting in the bushes:
Jerry counts **6 birds**.

He sees **2/3 of that number** flying overhead.

So,  
$$
\frac{2}{3} \times 6 = 4 \text{ birds}
$$

### 3. Birds feeding in groups:
There are **3 groups of 8 birds each** feeding.

So,  
$$
3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ birds}
$$

### Now, add all the birds together:

- Nesting: 6  
- Flying: 4  
- Feeding: 24  

$$
6 + 4 + 24 = 34
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **34 birds**

   $$
   55 - 5 = 50 \text{ cookies}
   $$

4. **She placed the remaining cookies equally into five jars:**  
   To find how many cookies are in each jar, divide the remaining cookies by 5:
   $$
   50 \div 5 = 10
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **10 cookies per jar**.

We are told:

- A **whirligig** spins **5 times** faster than a **thingamabob**.
- A **whatchamacallit** spins **11 times** faster than a **thingamabob**.
- A **whatchamacallit** spins at **121 meters per second**.

We need to find how fast a **whirligig** spins.

---

### Step 2: Let’s define a variable

Let the speed of a **thingamabob** be:

$$
x \text{ meters per second}
$$

Then:

- Speed of a **whirligig** = $ 5x $
- Speed of a **whatchamacallit** = $ 11x $

We’re given that the **whatchamacallit** spins at **121 m/s**, so:

$$
11x = 121
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = \frac{121}{11} = 11
$$

So, the **thingamabob** spins at **11 m/s**.

---

### Step 4: Find the speed of a whirligig

$$
\text{Speed of whirligig} = 5x = 5 \times 11 = 55 \text{ m/s}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{55 \text{ meters per second}}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Ellen pays for **one carrot** each day.

---

### Step 1: Understand what Ellen buys daily
Ellen eats:
- **2 carrots**
- **1 salad**
- **1 yogurt**

She pays **$11** total per day for these items.

---

### Step 2: Assign variables
Let’s define:
- Let the **price of one carrot** be **x** dollars.
- The **salad costs $6**.
- The **yogurt is half the price of the salad**, so it costs **$6 ÷ 2 = $3**.

So, the total cost per day is:

$$
\text{Total cost} = 2x + 6 + 3 = 11
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve the equation
$$
2x + 6 + 3 = 11
$$
$$
2x + 9 = 11
$$
$$
2x = 11 - 9
$$
$$
2x = 2
$$
$$
x = 1
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Ellen pays **$1** for **one carrot** every day.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Mark works 8 hours a day**  
   - So, in one day, he works:  
     $ 8 \text{ hours/day} $

2. **He works 5 days a week**  
   - Total hours per week:  
     $ 8 \text{ hours/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 40 \text{ hours/week} $

3. **His hourly wage was increased by $2**  
   - He used to make $10/hour, now he makes:  
     $ 10 + 2 = 12 \text{ dollars/hour} $

4. **Total weekly pay**  
   - Multiply total hours per week by his new hourly rate:  
     $ 40 \text{ hours/week} \times 12 \text{ dollars/hour} = 480 \text{ dollars/week} $

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Mark makes $480 a week.**
We are told that **Tasha made $80 total** from selling lemonade and mowing lawns.

We are also given information about how many times she mowed lawns for different people:

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let’s define:
- Let **x** = number of times Tasha mowed Joe's lawn in the first week.
- Then, she mowed Kamala's lawn **3x** times (since it was thrice as many).
- In the second week, she mowed Alba's lawn **5x** times (again, five times as many as Joe's).
- Joe paid **$6 per time** she mowed his lawn.

So, total money earned from mowing lawns is:

$$
\text{Money from mowing} = (\text{Joe}) + (\text{Kamala}) + (\text{Alba})
= 6x + 6(3x) + 6(5x)
$$

Simplify:

$$
= 6x + 18x + 30x = 54x
$$

So, Tasha made **$54x** from mowing lawns.

---

### Step 2: Total earnings

We are told that her **total earnings** were **$80**, so:

$$
\text{Earnings from lemonade} + \text{Earnings from mowing} = 80
$$

Substitute in the expression for mowing:

$$
\text{Lemonade sales} + 54x = 80
$$

So,

$$
\text{Lemonade sales} = 80 - 54x
$$

---

### Step 3: Find x

But we need to find **x**. However, there's **no direct value for x** given. So we must assume that **x is a whole number**, since you can’t mow a fraction of a lawn.

Try possible integer values of x such that **54x ≤ 80**.

Try **x = 1**:

$$
54(1) = 54 \Rightarrow \text{Lemonade sales} = 80 - 54 = 26
$$

Try **x = 2**:

$$
54(2) = 108 > 80 \Rightarrow \text{Too much}
$$

So **x = 1** is the only valid solution.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\text{Tasha made } \$26 \text{ from lemonade sales.}}
$$
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Martin's weight** = 55 kg  
2. **Carl’s weight** is 16 kg more than Martin’s:  
   $$
   55 + 16 = 71 \text{ kg}
   $$

3. **Christian’s weight** is 8 kg more than Carl’s:  
   $$
   71 + 8 = 79 \text{ kg}
   $$

4. **Harry’s weight** is 5 kg less than Christian’s:  
   $$
   79 - 5 = 74 \text{ kg}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **74 kg**
Let's break this down step by step to find **John's profit** from renting his car.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate total hours John rents his car per month**

He rents it out **10 times a month**, and each time for **3 hours**:

$$
\text{Total hours per month} = 10 \times 3 = 30 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total earnings per month**

He is paid **$25 per hour**:

$$
\text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ hours} \times 25 = \$750
$$

---

### **Step 3: Subtract the car payment to find profit**

His **car payment is $500** per month. Profit is calculated as:

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Earnings} - \text{Car Payment} = 750 - 500 = \$250
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$250}
$$

John makes a **profit of $250 per month** from renting his car.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define Variables

Let’s let:

- $ M $ = the number of notebooks Martha originally had  
- $ J $ = the number of notebooks Joseph had

We are told:

> "Joseph had 3 times as many notebooks as Martha."

So:

$$
J = 3M
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the Information About Martha

Martha **bought 5 more notebooks**, and now she has a total of **7 notebooks**.

So:

$$
M + 5 = 7
$$

Solve for $ M $:

$$
M = 7 - 5 = 2
$$

---

### Step 3: Find Joseph's Number of Notebooks

We know from earlier that:

$$
J = 3M = 3 \times 2 = 6
$$

So Joseph has **6 notebooks**.

---

### Step 4: Find How Many More Than Joseph Martha Has

Martha now has **7 notebooks**, Joseph has **6 notebooks**.

So, Martha has:

$$
7 - 6 = 1
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Martha now has 1 more notebook than Joseph.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Dijana's distance**:  
   Dijana rowed **50 miles**.

2. **Anis's distance**:  
   Anis rowed **1/5 times more** than Dijana.  
   This means Anis rowed:  
   $$
   50 + \left(\frac{1}{5} \times 50\right) = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
   $$

3. **Total distance rowed by both**:  
   $$
   50 \text{ (Dijana)} + 60 \text{ (Anis)} = 110 \text{ miles}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**110 miles** is the total distance the two of them rowed on that day.
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Total cookies made:**  
   Susan made **100 cookies**.

2. **Husband takes some cookies:**  
   Her husband took **4 cookies** for himself.  
   So, the number of cookies left is:  
   $$
   100 - 4 = 96 \text{ cookies}
   $$

3. **Dividing the remaining cookies among 6 nephews:**  
   Now, Susan wants to divide the **96 cookies equally** among her **6 nephews**.  
   To find how many each nephew gets, divide:  
   $$
   96 \div 6 = 16
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Each of Susan’s nephews will get **16 cookies**.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: What Denise and Daniel read yesterday**

- **Denise read:** 10 pages  
- **Daniel read:** 13 pages

---

### **Step 2: What Denise read today**

It says:

> "Today, Denise read 5 more than as many pages as what Daniel read yesterday."

So we need to find how many pages Denise read today:

- Daniel read **13 pages** yesterday.
- Denise read **5 more than that**, so:

$$
\text{Denise today} = 13 + 5 = 18 \text{ pages}
$$

---

### **Step 3: What Daniel read today**

> "Daniel was not able to read any pages today."

So:

$$
\text{Daniel today} = 0 \text{ pages}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total pages each read**

- **Denise total:**  
  Yesterday: 10 pages  
  Today: 18 pages  
  $$ \text{Total} = 10 + 18 = 28 \text{ pages} $$

- **Daniel total:**  
  Yesterday: 13 pages  
  Today: 0 pages  
  $$ \text{Total} = 13 + 0 = 13 \text{ pages} $$

---

### **Step 5: How many more pages did Denise read than Daniel?**

$$
\text{Difference} = 28 - 13 = \boxed{15} \text{ pages}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Denise read 15 more pages than Daniel.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the total amount of soup**

- The pot has enough soup to fill:
  - **4 adult bowls**, or
  - **8 child bowls**

So, we can say that:

> **1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls**  
(Because 4 adult bowls = 8 child bowls)

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many people are eating**

Calvin is making soup for his family. He is an **adult**, and he is eating with:
- His **adult wife**
- Their **two children**

So, in total, there are:

- **2 adults**
- **2 children**

That’s **4 people total**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how much soup is used**

Each person eats **1 bowl** of soup.

So, **4 bowls** of soup will be eaten in total.

Now, remember that **1 adult bowl = 2 child bowls**.

So, the **total amount of soup** in the pot is equivalent to **8 child bowls** (or 4 adult bowls).

If **4 bowls** are used (by 2 adults and 2 children), then:

- **Soup left = 8 child bowls – 4 child bowls = 4 child bowls**

---

### **Step 4: How many times can each child have a bowl from the leftover?**

There are **2 children**, and **4 child bowls** are left.

So, if the leftover soup is divided equally between the two children:

$$
\frac{4 \text{ child bowls}}{2 \text{ children}} = 2 \text{ bowls per child}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Each child will be able to have **2 bowls** of soup from the leftover soup.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Price of one notebook** = $1.50  
2. **Price of one ballpen** = $0.50  

William bought:
- **5 notebooks**  
- **1 ballpen**

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the notebooks
$$
5 \text{ notebooks} \times \$1.50 = \$7.50
$$

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the ballpen
$$
1 \text{ ballpen} \times \$0.50 = \$0.50
$$

### Step 3: Add the two amounts together
$$
\$7.50 + \$0.50 = \$8.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**William spent $8.00 in total.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much material Jo needs to make **20 small masks** and **8 large masks**.

---

### Step 1: Determine material needed for one small mask

Jo can make **4 small masks with 2 yards of material**.

So, the amount of material per small mask is:

$$
\frac{2 \text{ yards}}{4 \text{ masks}} = 0.5 \text{ yards per small mask}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine material needed for one large mask

Jo can make **3 large masks with 2.25 yards of material**.

So, the amount of material per large mask is:

$$
\frac{2.25 \text{ yards}}{3 \text{ masks}} = 0.75 \text{ yards per large mask}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate total material for 20 small masks

$$
20 \text{ masks} \times 0.5 \text{ yards/mask} = 10 \text{ yards}
$$

---

### Step 4: Calculate total material for 8 large masks

$$
8 \text{ masks} \times 0.75 \text{ yards/mask} = 6 \text{ yards}
$$

---

### Step 5: Add both amounts together

$$
10 \text{ yards} + 6 \text{ yards} = 16 \text{ yards}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Jo would need **16 yards of material** to make **20 small masks** and **8 large masks**.
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Total number of movie viewings
Deepa has seen **9** movies, and she has seen **each one 3 times**.

So the total number of viewings is:
$$
9 \times 3 = 27 \text{ viewings}
$$

### Step 2: Total cost
She spent a total of **$216** on all these viewings.

### Step 3: Calculate average price per ticket
To find the **average price per ticket**, divide the total cost by the number of tickets (viewings):

$$
\text{Average price per ticket} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of tickets}} = \frac{216}{27}
$$

Now perform the division:

$$
\frac{216}{27} = 8
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The average price she paid per ticket is $8.**

- **Red shoeboxes:** 9  

### Step 2: Number of shoeboxes used for fishing
- **Blue shoeboxes used:** 3  
- **Red shoeboxes used:** $ \frac{1}{3} $ of the red shoeboxes

So, we calculate:
$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
$$
Therefore, **3 red shoeboxes** are used.

### Step 3: Subtract the used boxes from the original amounts

- **Remaining blue shoeboxes:**
$$
7 - 3 = 4
$$

- **Remaining red shoeboxes:**
$$
9 - 3 = 6
$$

### Final Answer:
- **Blue shoeboxes left:** 4  
- **Red shoeboxes left:** 6  

✅ **Total shoeboxes left in Tim's box = 4 + 6 = 10**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Sarah has 9 books.**  
   So, Sarah's number of books = 9.

2. **Joseph had twice the number of Sarah’s books.**  
   That means Joseph originally had:  
   $ 2 \times 9 = 18 $ books.

3. **Joseph lost 2 of them.**  
   So, we subtract 2 from his original number of books:  
   $ 18 - 2 = 16 $

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Joseph currently has 16 books.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Total marbles Dean has
Dean starts with **30 marbles**.

---

### Step 2: Marbles given to Jamie
Dean gives **1/5** of his marbles to Jamie.

$$
\frac{1}{5} \text{ of } 30 = \frac{30}{5} = 6
$$

So, Dean gives **6 marbles** to Jamie.

---

### Step 3: Marbles given to Donald
Dean gives **10 marbles** to Donald.

---

### Step 4: Total marbles given away
$$
6 \text{ (to Jamie)} + 10 \text{ (to Donald)} = 16 \text{ marbles}
$$

---

### Step 5: Marbles left for Dean
$$
30 - 16 = 14
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**14 marbles are left for Dean.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- Duncan's current age = 60
- Duncan's age **eight years ago** was **two times** Adam's age **four years ago**

We are to find: **How old will Adam be in 8 years?**

---

### **Step 1: Express ages in terms of variables**

Let’s define:

- Let **A** be Adam's **current** age.

Then:

- Duncan's age **eight years ago** = $ 60 - 8 = 52 $
- Adam's age **four years ago** = $ A - 4 $

According to the problem:

> Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago

So we write the equation:

$$
52 = 2 \times (A - 4)
$$

---

### **Step 2: Solve the equation**

$$
52 = 2(A - 4)
$$

Divide both sides by 2:

$$
26 = A - 4
$$

Add 4 to both sides:

$$
A = 30
$$

So, **Adam is currently 30 years old.**

---

### **Step 3: Find how old Adam will be in 8 years**

$$
\text{Adam's age in 8 years} = 30 + 8 = \boxed{38}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Adam will be 38 years old in 8 years.**
Let's solve this step by step.

1. **Farmer Brown's farm** is **200 acres**.

2. **Farmer Smith's farm** is **100 acres more than twice** Farmer Brown's farm.

   - First, find **twice** Farmer Brown's farm:
     $$
     2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ acres}
     $$

   - Then add **100 acres** to that:
     $$
     400 + 100 = 500 \text{ acres}
     $$

3. Now, add the two farms together:
   $$
   200 + 500 = 700 \text{ acres}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **700 acres**
Let's break this down step by step.

50 - 10 = 40 \text{ packages per hour}
$$

### Step 3: Calculate how many packages he completes in an 8-hour workday
$$
40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages}
$$

### Step 4: Calculate his earnings for the day
$$
320 \text{ packages} \times \$0.20/\text{package} = \$64
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$64}

Let's break this down step by step:

---

### 1. **How long does it take John to solve an extreme Sudoku?**

- A **normal Sudoku** takes **45 minutes**.
- An **extreme Sudoku** takes **4 times** that long.

$$
\text{Time for extreme Sudoku} = 4 \times 45 = 180 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### 2. **How many bottles of water does John drink in that time?**

- John drinks **1 bottle of water every half hour**.
- Half an hour is **30 minutes**.

So, we need to find how many **30-minute intervals** are in **180 minutes**:

$$
\frac{180}{30} = 6
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{6}
$$

We are given the following information:

- Benny threw **2 pieces of bologna** at each **red balloon**.
- Benny threw **3 pieces of bologna** at each **yellow balloon**.
- He threw a total of **58 pieces of bologna**.
- There were **20 red balloons**.

We are asked to find how many **yellow balloons** there were.

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ r = $ number of red balloons (already given as 20)
- $ y = $ number of yellow balloons (what we need to find)

---

### Step 2: Set up the equation

Total bologna thrown is:

$$
\text{Total bologna} = (\text{pieces per red balloon}) \times (\text{number of red balloons}) + (\text{pieces per yellow balloon}) \times (\text{number of yellow balloons})
$$

Substitute known values:

$$
58 = 2 \times 20 + 3 \times y
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ y $

$$
58 = 40 + 3y
$$

Subtract 40 from both sides:

$$
18 = 3y
$$

Divide both sides by 3:

$$
y = 6
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{6}
$$

So, there were **6 yellow balloons**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Jon drives 100 miles a day.**  
   - In one day: 100 miles

2. **He drives for 30 days in a month.**  
   - Total miles driven in a month = 100 miles/day × 30 days = **3,000 miles**

3. **His car needs a tune-up every 1,000 miles.**  
   - So we divide the total miles by the tune-up interval:  
     $$
     \frac{3,000 \text{ miles}}{1,000 \text{ miles/tune-up}} = 3
     $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **3 tune-ups** are needed in that time.
Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Tuesday:** Bruce works **5 hours**.

2. **Wednesday:** He works **twice the time** he worked on Tuesday.  
   So, Wednesday = 2 × 5 = **10 hours**.

3. **Thursday:** He works **2 hours less** than on Wednesday.  
   So, Thursday = 10 - 2 = **8 hours**.

Now, add up the hours for all three days:

- Tuesday: 5 hours  
- Wednesday: 10 hours  
- Thursday: 8 hours  

**Total = 5 + 10 + 8 = 23 hours**

✅ **Answer: Bruce works a total of 23 hours.**
Let's break the problem down step by step to find out how much **Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them**.

---

### Step 1: Understand what we're trying to find

We are told that Julia and Nadine were given the **same amount of allowance** by their mother.  
They combined their money, so the total amount they had together is:

$$
\text{Total Allowance} = \text{Julia's Allowance} + \text{Nadine's Allowance}
$$

Since they were given the same amount, let’s call this amount **x**.

So,

$$
\text{Total Allowance} = x + x = 2x
$$

Our goal is to find **x**, the amount each received.

---

### Step 2: Calculate total expenses

#### a) Cost of the cake:
- The cake costs **$11**

#### b) Cost of the balloons:
- They bought **1 dozen (12) balloons**
- Balloons are sold at **$0.50 for 2 balloons**

So, for 12 balloons:

$$
\frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ sets of 2 balloons}
$$

$$
6 \times 0.50 = 3.00
$$

So, the balloons cost **$3**

#### c) Cost of ice cream:
- They bought **2 tubs of ice cream**
- Each tub costs **$7**

$$
2 \times 7 = 14
$$

So, the ice cream costs **$14**

---

### Step 3: Total money spent

Add up all the expenses:

$$
\text{Total spent} = 11 (\text{cake}) + 3 (\text{balloons}) + 14 (\text{ice cream}) = 28
$$

---

### Step 4: Set up the equation

The total money they had was equal to the total money spent:

$$
2x = 28
$$

Solve for **x**:

$$
x = \frac{28}{2} = 14
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Julia and Nadine's mother gave each of them $14.**
Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of fruits Kira bought:**

   $ 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 $

2. **Lola ate 2 pieces of the fruit.**

3. **Fruits left = Total fruits - Fruits eaten**  
   $ 14 - 2 = 12 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **12 pieces of fruit are left.**

$$
16 + 22 = 38 \text{ students}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total number of students
Each student participates in only **one group**, so we can add all the groups together:

$$
\text{Tennis} + \text{Volleyball} + \text{Soccer} = 6 + 12 + 38 = 56
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{56}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much money the class was able to raise from selling lollipops.

---

### **Step 1: Determine total number of lollipops sold**

There are **30 students**, and each student sold an average of **10 lollipops**.

$$
\text{Total lollipops sold} = 30 \times 10 = 300 \text{ lollipops}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total revenue from selling lollipops**

Each lollipop is sold for **$0.80**.

$$
\text{Total revenue} = 300 \times 0.80 = 240 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total cost of buying lollipops**

Each lollipop costs **$0.50** to buy.

$$
\text{Total cost} = 300 \times 0.50 = 150 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate profit (money raised)**

Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

$$
\text{Profit} = 240 - 150 = 90 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{90} \text{ dollars}
$$

So, the class was able to raise **$90** from the profit of selling lollipops.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Number of cats
Larry has **3 cats**.

---

### Step 2: Number of dogs
He has **3 times as many dogs as cats**.

$$
\text{Dogs} = 3 \times 3 = 9
$$

---

### Step 3: Number of rabbits
He has **2 fewer rabbits than dogs**.

$$
\text{Rabbits} = 9 - 2 = 7
$$

---

### Step 4: Number of fish
He has a **fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits**.

$$
\text{Fish} = 3 \times 7 = 21
$$

---

### Step 5: Number of gerbils
He has a collection of **gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish**.

$$
\text{Gerbils} = \frac{1}{3} \times 21 = 7
$$

---

### Step 6: Total number of pets
Now, let's add up all the pets:

$$
\text{Total pets} = \text{Cats} + \text{Dogs} + \text{Rabbits} + \text{Fish} + \text{Gerbils}
$$
$$
= 3 + 9 + 7 + 21 + 7 = 47
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Larry has 47 pets.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total slices in the loaf**:  
   The loaf has **24 slices**.

2. **How much Abby eats per day**:  
   Abby can eat **2 slices a day**.

3. **How much Josh eats per day**:  
   Josh can eat **twice as much** as Abby, so:  
   $ 2 \times 2 = 4 $ slices per day.

4. **Total slices eaten per day by both**:  
   $ 2 \text{ (Abby)} + 4 \text{ (Josh)} = 6 $ slices per day.

5. **How many days will the loaf last?**  
   To find how many days the loaf will last, divide the total number of slices by the number of slices eaten per day:  
   $$
   \frac{24}{6} = 4
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **4 days**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Martha starts collecting shells when she turns 5 years old.**
2. **She collects one shell every month.**
3. **We are asked how many shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday.**

---

### Step 1: Determine the number of years she collects shells
- She starts at age **5**.
- She stops at age **10** (on her 10th birthday).
- So, she collects shells for:  
  $$
  10 - 5 = 5 \text{ years}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Convert years to months
- There are **12 months in a year**, so:
  $$
  5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Calculate total shells collected
- She collects **1 shell per month**, so:
  $$
  60 \text{ months} \times 1 \text{ shell/month} = 60 \text{ shells}
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{60}
$$

Martha will have collected **60 shells** by her 10th birthday.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of tea cups**
Lana has **27 cups** of tea in total.

---

### **Step 2: Divide into 3 rows**
She divides these 27 cups into **3 rows**.  
So, each row has:

$$
\frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups per row}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea**
In **each row**, she creates **equal amounts** of **chamomile** and **mint** tea.  
That means, for each row:

- Half of the 9 cups are **chamomile**
- The other half are **mint**

$$
\frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \text{ cups of mint tea per row}
$$

But wait — we can’t have half a cup of tea in this context. That suggests that the **total number of cups** must be divisible evenly among the types of tea.

Let’s double-check our assumptions to see if there's an error.

---

### **Alternative interpretation (to avoid fractions):**

If **each row** has **equal numbers** of **chamomile** and **mint** tea, then the number of cups in each row must be **even**. But 9 is odd, so it's not possible to split 9 evenly into two equal parts.

This implies that the **number of cups in each row must be even**, but 27 is not divisible by 3 evenly when divided into rows with even numbers of cups.

So maybe the question assumes that **the total number of cups used for chamomile and mint is 18**, and the remaining 9 are used for cinnamon tea?

Let’s try this new approach.

---

### **Revised Step-by-step:**

#### **Total cups = 27**

#### **She uses some cups for cinnamon tea:**
She uses **15 cups** for **cinnamon tea**.

So, the remaining cups are:

$$
27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups}
$$

These 12 cups are used for **chamomile** and **mint tea**.

#### **She divides them into 3 rows:**

$$
\frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ cups per row}
$$

#### **Each row has equal amounts of chamomile and mint:**

So, in each row:
- Chamomile = Mint = $ \frac{4}{2} = 2 $ cups

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{2} \text{ cups of mint tea in each row}
$$
We are told that a **three-toed sloth** takes **4 hours per trip** to go down the tree, pick berries, and climb back up. He wants to collect **24 berries in 8 hours**, and he picks the **same number of berries on each trip**.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours

Each trip takes **4 hours**, so:

$$
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Time per trip}} = \frac{8}{4} = 2 \text{ trips}
$$

So the sloth can only make **2 trips** in 8 hours.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the minimum number of berries per trip

He wants to collect **24 berries** in total over **2 trips**, and he picks the **same number of berries on each trip**.

Let $ x $ be the number of berries picked per trip.

Then:

$$
2x = 24 \Rightarrow x = \frac{24}{2} = 12
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{12}
$$

The **least number of berries** the sloth can pick up per trip is **12 berries**.
Let's break the problem down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Total water in the pool**
- The pool has **10,000 gallons** of water.

---

### **Step 2: Water filled into the tank**
- Anthony and his father fill a **tank with half the amount of water in the pool**.
- So, the tank contains:
  $$
  \frac{1}{2} \times 10,000 = 5,000 \text{ gallons}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Water usage rate**
- The tank is emptied at a rate of **500 gallons per day**.

---

### **Step 4: Water used in 6 days**
- In 6 days, the amount of water used is:
  $$
  500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons}
  $$

---

### **Step 5: Water remaining in the tank after 6 days**
- Initially, the tank had **5,000 gallons**.
- After using **3,000 gallons**, the remaining amount is:
  $$
  5,000 - 3,000 = 2,000 \text{ gallons}
  $$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{2000} \text{ gallons}
$$
Let's break down the problem **step by step** to figure out how many movies Colby can see on the last day of the month.

---

### **Given:**

- **Monthly budget:** $150
- **Tickets:**
  - **Fridays and Saturdays:** $10 each
  - **Other days:** $7 each
- **Snacks:**
  - **Popcorn:** $8 per tub
  - **Candy box:** $2 per box
- **Today is Friday (last day of the month)**
- **He wants to get popcorn and candy tonight.**
- **Already used:**
  - 5 movies on a **Friday or Saturday**
  - 8 movies on **other days**
  - 2 tubs of popcorn
  - 4 boxes of candy

---

### **Step 1: Calculate total spent so far**

#### **Movies:**

- 5 movies on Friday/Saturday → $10 × 5 = **$50**
- 8 movies on other days → $7 × 8 = **$56**
  
→ Total spent on movies = $50 + $56 = **$106**

#### **Snacks:**

- 2 tubs of popcorn → $8 × 2 = **$16**
- 4 boxes of candy → $2 × 4 = **$8**

→ Total spent on snacks = $16 + $8 = **$24**

---

### **Step 2: Total money spent so far**

Total spent = $106 (movies) + $24 (snacks) = **$130**

But wait — his **budget is only $150**, so he has:

**$150 – $130 = $20 left**

---

### **Step 3: What does he want to do today?**

- He wants to **see a movie**, and also **get popcorn and candy tonight**.
- That means:
  - **Movie ticket**: $10 (since it's a Friday)
  - **Popcorn**: $8
  - **Candy**: $2

So, total cost for **one movie + popcorn + candy** = $10 + $8 + $2 = **$20**

---

### **Step 4: Can he afford it?**

Yes! He has exactly **$20 left**, and that’s exactly what this combination costs.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Colby can see 1 more movie** tonight if he buys popcorn and candy.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the problem**

Andrew bakes:
- **200 mini cinnamon rolls**
- **300 mini blueberry muffins**

Each **mini pastry** has **1/3rd of the calories** of a **normal version**.

We are given:
- A **normal cinnamon roll** has **600 calories**
- A **normal blueberry muffin** has **450 calories**

We need to find the **total number of calories** in all the pastries Andrew baked.

---

### **Step 2: Find the calories per mini pastry**

Since each mini pastry is **1/3rd** of a normal one:

- **Mini cinnamon roll = 600 ÷ 3 = 200 calories**
- **Mini blueberry muffin = 450 ÷ 3 = 150 calories**

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total calories for each type**

- **Cinnamon rolls:**  
  $ 200 \text{ mini rolls} \times 200 \text{ calories/roll} = 40,000 \text{ calories} $

- **Blueberry muffins:**  
  $ 300 \text{ mini muffins} \times 150 \text{ calories/muffin} = 45,000 \text{ calories} $

---

### **Step 4: Add them together**

$$
\text{Total calories} = 40,000 + 45,000 = \boxed{85,000}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{85,000} \text{ calories}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step to find the **average number of Junebugs** Rita removes per day.

---

### Step 1: Determine the number of Junebugs removed each day

- **Monday:** 39 Junebugs  
- **Tuesday:** Twice as many as Monday → $2 \times 39 = 78$  
- **Wednesday:** Same as Tuesday → 78  
- **Thursday:** 48 Junebugs  
- **Friday:** 57 Junebugs  

---

### Step 2: Add up the total number of Junebugs removed over the 5 days

$$
39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = ?
$$

Let’s add them step by step:

- $39 + 78 = 117$
- $117 + 78 = 195$
- $195 + 48 = 243$
- $243 + 57 = 300$

So, **total Junebugs removed = 300**

---

### Step 3: Find the average per day

There are **5 days**, so the average is:

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total}}{\text{Number of Days}} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day is 60.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the distance the bus traveled

The bus travels at a speed of **60 miles per hour** for **5 hours**.

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the distance the car traveled

The car travels at a speed of **30 miles per hour** for **8 hours**.

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find how much farther the bus traveled

$$
\text{Difference in distance} = 300 \, \text{miles} - 240 \, \text{miles} = 60 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{60} \, \text{miles}
$$

The bus traveled **60 miles farther** than the car.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

We are told:

- Sophie has **31 building blocks**.
- She has **8 stuffed animals**.
- She has **9 stacking rings**.
- She bought a **tube of bouncy balls**, and after adding them, her total number of toys is **62**.

We are asked: **How many bouncy balls came in the tube?**

---

### Step 1: Add up the known toys

Let’s add the number of blocks, stuffed animals, and stacking rings:

$$
31 \text{ (blocks)} + 8 \text{ (stuffed animals)} + 9 \text{ (stacking rings)} = 48
$$

So, before adding the bouncy balls, Sophie already has **48 toys**.

---

### Step 2: Find out how many bouncy balls were added

She now has a **total of 62 toys**. So, the number of bouncy balls is:

$$
62 - 48 = 14
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**14 bouncy balls** came in the tube.
We are given the following information:

1. The **combined age** of Peter, Paul, and Jean is **100 years**.
2. **Paul is 10 years older than John**.
3. **Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's ages**.

Let’s define variables for each person’s age:

- Let **P** = Peter’s age  
- Let **Pa** = Paul’s age  
- Let **J** = John’s age

---

### Step 1: Use the given relationships

From the problem:

- **Paul is 10 years older than John**:  
  $$
  Pa = J + 10 \tag{1}
  $$

- **Peter’s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's ages**:  
  $$
  P = Pa + J \tag{2}
  $$

- **Combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years**:  
  $$
  P + Pa + J = 100 \tag{3}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Substitute equations (1) and (2) into equation (3)

From equation (1):  
$$
Pa = J + 10
$$

From equation (2):  
$$
P = Pa + J = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
$$

Now substitute both **Pa** and **P** in terms of **J** into equation (3):

$$
P + Pa + J = 100 \\
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
$$

Simplify:

$$
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100 \\
4J + 20 = 100
$$

Subtract 20 from both sides:

$$
4J = 80
$$

Divide by 4:

$$
J = 20
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the other ages

- John’s age = **J = 20**
- Paul’s age = **Pa = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30**
- Peter’s age = **P = Pa + J = 30 + 20 = 50**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Peter is 50 years old.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### Step 1: How many people are there?
Maria invited **4 friends**, and she is also there.  
So, total number of people = **Maria + 4 friends = 5 people**

---

### Step 2: Initial balloons given by Maria
Maria gave **each friend 2 water balloons**.

So, for the 4 friends:
- 4 friends × 2 balloons = **8 balloons**

Maria had **1 balloon for herself**.

So far, total balloons = **8 (friends) + 1 (Maria) = 9 balloons**

---

### Step 3: Balloons given by Maria’s mom
Maria’s mom gave **each person 3 more balloons**.

There are **5 people** in total (Maria + 4 friends).

So, 5 people × 3 balloons = **15 balloons**

---

### Step 4: Total balloons
Add the initial balloons and the ones from Maria’s mom:

- Initial: **9 balloons**
- From mom: **15 balloons**

**Total balloons = 9 + 15 = 24**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**24 water balloons** in total.
Let's break this down step by step:

### **Step 1: Total number of boxes donated**
- 10 people donate 5 boxes each:
  $$
  10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ boxes}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Add the boxes they already have**
- They also have 10 boxes already:
  $$
  50 + 10 = 60 \text{ boxes}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Determine how many boxes can be placed per table**
- Each table can hold **2 boxes**.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate total number of tables needed**
- To find out how many tables are needed for 60 boxes:
  $$
  \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ tables}
  $$

---

### **Step 5: Subtract the number of tables they already own**
- They already own 15 tables:
  $$
  30 - 15 = 15 \text{ new tables needed}
  $$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{15}
$$

They need **15 new tables**.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total distance for Zoey**

Zoey has **40 seeds**, and she spits each one **10 feet**.

$$
\text{Total distance for Zoey} = 40 \times 10 = 400 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the total distance for Sydney**

Sydney has **35 seeds**, and she spits each one **12 feet**.

$$
\text{Total distance for Sydney} = 35 \times 12 = 420 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the average total distance spat**

To find the **average total distance**, we add both totals and divide by 2:

$$
\text{Average total distance} = \frac{400 + 420}{2} = \frac{820}{2} = 410 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{410 \text{ feet}}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the number of hours in a month**

The Widgeteer 3000 and WidgetMaster 9000 both run **24 hours a day** for **30 days**.

$$
\text{Total hours} = 24 \, \text{hours/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 720 \, \text{hours}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the number of widgets each machine produces in a month**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**  
  $$
  60 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 720 \, \text{hours} = 43,200 \, \text{widgets}
  $$

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**  
  $$
  45 \, \text{widgets/hour} \times 720 \, \text{hours} = 32,400 \, \text{widgets}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the revenue from each machine**

Each widget sells for **$6**.

- **Widgeteer 3000 revenue:**  
  $$
  43,200 \, \text{widgets} \times 6 = 259,200 \, \text{dollars}
  $$

- **WidgetMaster 9000 revenue:**  
  $$
  32,400 \, \text{widgets} \times 6 = 194,400 \, \text{dollars}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Find the difference in revenue**

$$
259,200 - 194,400 = 64,800
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Fern will make **$64,800 more** by choosing the **Widgeteer 3000** over the **WidgetMaster 9000**.
Let's break this down step by step to determine how much Cameron would **save** by choosing the **hourly add-on option** instead of paying for a **24-hour stay**.

---

### **1. Understand the pricing options:**

- **Option A (12-hour stay):**  
  - Cost = ₱1000  
  - Valid for 12 hours

- **Option B (24-hour stay):**  
  - Cost = ₱1600  
  - Valid for 24 hours

- **Option C (Hourly add-on after 12 hours):**  
  - First 12 hours: ₱1000  
  - Each additional hour: ₱70

---

### **2. Determine the total time Cameron is staying:**

- **Arrival:** 5 pm  
- **Departure:** 10 am next day  

Let’s calculate the total time:

- From **5 pm to midnight** = 7 hours  
- From **midnight to 10 am** = 10 hours  
- **Total stay = 7 + 10 = 17 hours**

---

### **3. Calculate cost using Option C (hourly add-on):**

- First 12 hours: ₱1000  
- Additional hours = 17 - 12 = **5 hours**  
- Cost of additional hours = 5 × ₱70 = **₱350**

**Total cost with Option C = ₱1000 + ₱350 = ₱1350**

---

### **4. Compare with Option B (24-hour stay):**

- Cost of 24-hour stay = **₱1600**

---

### **5. Calculate savings:**

- Savings = Cost of 24-hour stay − Cost with hourly add-on  
- Savings = ₱1600 − ₱1350 = **₱250**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Cameron would **save ₱250** by choosing the hourly add-on option instead of paying for a full 24-hour stay.
Let's solve this step by step:

So, the total number of letters Craig has spelled is:

$$
20 \times 15 = 300 \text{ letters}
$$

---

### Step 2: Understand Craig's brother's total letters
- Craig's brother has spelled **50 more letters** than Craig.

So, the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled is:

$$
300 + 50 = 350 \text{ letters}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of letters both have spelled together

$$
300 \text{ (Craig)} + 350 \text{ (Brother)} = 650 \text{ letters}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{650}
$$
We are told:

- Children are standing **8 in a row**.
- There are **7 rows**.
- This arrangement is for **5 different schools**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the number of children per school

Each school has:
- 8 children per row
- 7 rows

So, the number of children per school is:
$$
8 \text{ children/row} \times 7 \text{ rows} = 56 \text{ children}
$$

---

### Step 2: Multiply by the number of schools

There are 5 schools, so total number of children is:
$$
56 \text{ children/school} \times 5 \text{ schools} = 280 \text{ children}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{280}
$$

There can be **280 children** in the drill.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total number of bottles the teacher gets from coupons**

- The teacher has **9 coupons**.
- Each coupon can be redeemed for **100 bottles** of apple juice.
  
So, total number of bottles she gets is:

$$
9 \times 100 = 900 \text{ bottles}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Number of bottles given to students**

- There are **29 students**.
- Each student gets **2 bottles** of apple juice.

So, total number of bottles given to students is:

$$
29 \times 2 = 58 \text{ bottles}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Bottles remaining for the teacher**

Now subtract the number of bottles given to students from the total number of bottles obtained:

$$
900 - 58 = 842
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{842}
$$

The teacher has **842 bottles of apple juice** left for herself.
Let's break down the cost step by step based on the information provided:

---

### **1. Service Call Fee**
Patty's Plumbing charges **$40** to visit the house.

✅ **Service Call Fee = $40**

---

### **2. Labor Cost**
They charge **$35 per hour, or part thereof** for labor.

- The job took **2.25 hours**, which is **2 hours and 15 minutes**.
- Since labor is charged **per hour or part thereof**, this means:
  
  - **2 full hours = $35 × 2 = $70**
  - **The remaining 15 minutes (which is part of an hour)** = **another $35**

✅ **Total Labor Cost = $35 × 3 = $105**

---

### **3. Parts Cost**
The job used **$60 in parts**.

✅ **Parts Cost = $60**

---

### **4. Total Charge**
Now, add up all the costs:

$$
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Service Call Fee} + \text{Labor Cost} + \text{Parts Cost}
$$

$$
\text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60 = \boxed{205}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Patty charged $205.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much money James was **out** (i.e., how much he lost or spent in total).

---

### **Step 1: Cost of the CDs before discount**

James buys **10 CDs**, each costing **$15**.

$$
\text{Total cost before discount} = 10 \times 15 = \$150
$$

---

### **Step 2: Apply the 40% discount**

He gets a **40% discount**, so he pays **60%** of the original price.

$$
\text{Discounted price per CD} = 15 \times (1 - 0.40) = 15 \times 0.60 = \$9
$$

$$
\text{Total cost after discount} = 10 \times 9 = \$90
$$

So, James paid **$90** for all 10 CDs.

---

### **Step 3: He sells 5 CDs back**

He decides he doesn't like **5 CDs**, and sells them for **$40 total**.

So, he got **$40** back from selling those 5 CDs.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate total money out**

Now, let’s calculate how much **money James was out**:

- He spent **$90** on the 10 CDs.
- He got **$40** back from selling 5 of them.

$$
\text{Total money out} = 90 - 40 = \$50
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$50}
$$

James was **$50 out**.
Let's calculate how much Jen will earn by selling all her root crops step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate earnings from yams**
- She has **6 yams**.
- Each yam sells for **$1.50**.

$$
6 \times 1.50 = 9.00
$$

So, she earns **$9.00** from the yams.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate earnings from sweet potatoes**
- She has **10 sweet potatoes**.
- Each sweet potato sells for **$2.00**.

$$
10 \times 2.00 = 20.00
$$

So, she earns **$20.00** from the sweet potatoes.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate earnings from carrots**
- She has **4 carrots**.
- Each carrot sells for **$1.25**.

$$
4 \times 1.25 = 5.00
$$

So, she earns **$5.00** from the carrots.

---

### **Step 4: Add up all earnings**

$$
9.00 + 20.00 + 5.00 = 34.00
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Jen will earn **$34.00** if she sells everything.
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- **Total distance of the lake:** 20 miles  
- **James' swimming speed:** 2 miles per hour  
- **He swims 60% of the distance first**  
- **Then rests for half as long as the swimming time**  
- **Then finishes the remaining 40% of the distance at half his original speed**

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the distances**

- **First part (60% of 20 miles):**  
  $$
  0.60 \times 20 = 12 \text{ miles}
  $$

- **Second part (remaining 40% of 20 miles):**  
  $$
  0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ miles}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Time taken for the first swim**

James swims 12 miles at 2 mph:

$$
\text{Time}_1 = \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Rest time**

He rests for **half as long as the swimming time**, so:

$$
\text{Rest time} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Time taken for the second swim**

He swims the remaining 8 miles at **half the speed**, which is:

$$
\text{Speed}_2 = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ mph}
$$

So, time for the second swim:

$$
\text{Time}_2 = \frac{8}{1} = 8 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Total time**

Add up all the times:

$$
\text{Total time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Rest time} + \text{Time}_2 = 6 + 3 + 8 = 17 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{17 \text{ hours}}
$$
We are given:

- Sam had **70 loaves** of bread last Friday.
- The bakery has **40 less than seven times as many loaves** as Sam had.

Let's break it down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find seven times the number of loaves Sam had

$$
7 \times 70 = 490
$$

---

### Step 2: Subtract 40 from that amount

$$
490 - 40 = 450
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{450}
$$

So, the bakery has **450 loaves of bread**.
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Start with the initial number of stickers**:  
   Jasmine was given **15 stickers** for participating in class.

2. **Subtract the stickers she lost**:  
   She lost **7 stickers** during playtime.  
   So, we subtract:  
   $ 15 - 7 = 8 $

3. **Add the stickers she received for helping**:  
   Her teacher gave her **5 more stickers** for helping her classmates.  
   So, we add:  
   $ 8 + 5 = 13 $

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Determine the commission per copy for each newspaper:**

- **New York Times (NYT):**  
  - Commission rate = 10%  
  - Cost per copy = $5  
  - Commission per copy = 10% of $5 = $0.50

- **Wall Street Journal (WSJ):**  
  - Commission rate = 8%  
  - Cost per copy = $15  
  - Commission per copy = 8% of $15 = $1.20

---

### 2. **Calculate total commission from each newspaper:**

- **From 6 copies of NYT:**  
  $ 6 \times 0.50 = \$3.00 $

- **From 10 copies of WSJ:**  
  $ 10 \times 1.20 = \$12.00 $

---

### 3. **Add both amounts to find total commission:**

$$
\$3.00 + \$12.00 = \$15.00
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**Cayley will earn a total commission of \$15.00.**
Let's solve this step by step.

We are given:

1. **Marcus is half of Leo’s age.**  
   So, Marcus = (1/2) × Leo

2. **Marcus is five years younger than Deanna.**  
   So, Marcus = Deanna - 5

3. **Deanna is 26.**  
   So, Marcus = 26 - 5 = **21**

Now we know Marcus is **21 years old**.

From the first statement:  
Marcus = (1/2) × Leo  
So,  
21 = (1/2) × Leo  
Multiply both sides by 2:  
Leo = 42

### ✅ Final Answer: **Leo is 42 years old.**
We are given the following information:

- Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar each contributed to their team's **45 points**.
- **Bahati scored the most points**.
- **Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo**.
- **Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar**.

Let’s define variables for the number of points each person scored:

- Let **B** = points scored by Bahati  
- Let **A** = points scored by Azibo  
- Let **D** = points scored by Dinar

From the problem, we know:

1. $ B + A + D = 45 $ (total points scored by all three)
2. $ B = A + 20 $ (Bahati scored 20 more than Azibo)
3. $ B = D + 10 $ (Bahati scored 10 more than Dinar)

---

### Step 1: Express A and D in terms of B

From equation (2):  
$ A = B - 20 $

From equation (3):  
$ D = B - 10 $

---

### Step 2: Substitute into total points equation

Now substitute these expressions into the first equation:

$$
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45
$$

Simplify:

$$
B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45  
\Rightarrow 3B - 30 = 45
$$

Add 30 to both sides:

$$
3B = 75
$$

Divide both sides by 3:

$$
B = 25
$$

---

### Step 3: Find Azibo's score

Recall that:
$$
A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Azibo scored 5 points.**
We are given:

- The book is **1.5 inches thick**.
- The paper is **100 pages per inch** when stacked.
- Each sheet of paper is printed on **both sides**, and each side has **one page** of the book.

---

### Step 1: Understand what "pages per inch" means

The phrase **"100 pages to the inch"** means that **each inch of the stack contains 100 pages**.

But we need to be careful — this refers to **pages in a stack**, not sheets.

Each **sheet of paper** has **2 pages** (front and back), so:

- **1 sheet = 2 pages**
- So, if there are 100 pages per inch, that means:
  - $ \frac{100 \text{ pages}}{2} = 50 \text{ sheets per inch} $

---

### Step 2: Calculate total number of sheets in the book

The book is **1.5 inches thick**, and it contains **50 sheets per inch**, so:

$$
\text{Total sheets} = 1.5 \text{ inches} \times 50 \text{ sheets/inch} = 75 \text{ sheets}
$$

---

### Step 3: Convert sheets to pages

Since **1 sheet = 2 pages**, then:

$$
\text{Total pages} = 75 \text{ sheets} \times 2 = 150 \text{ pages}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{150} \text{ pages}
$$
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many minutes Vince worked**

He stapled reports from **8:00 AM to 11:00 PM**.

- From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is **15 hours**.
- Convert hours to minutes:  
  $$
  15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes}
  $$

So, Vince worked for **900 minutes**.

---

### **Step 2: Find out how many reports he staples per minute**

He staples **30 reports every 15 minutes**.

So, in **1 minute**, he staples:
$$
\frac{30}{15} = 2 \text{ reports per minute}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total number of reports stapled**

Now multiply the number of reports per minute by the total number of minutes worked:

$$
2 \text{ reports/minute} \times 900 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ reports}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{1800}
$$

Vince stapled **1800 reports** in total.
Let's break this down step by step to find out **how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day**.

---

### **Step 1: Determine Kim's usual sleep duration**

- She usually goes to sleep at **10 p.m.**
- She wakes up at **6 a.m.**
  
So, her **usual sleep duration** is:

$$
6 \text{ a.m.} - 10 \text{ p.m.} = 8 \text{ hours}
$$

Convert that to minutes:

$$
8 \times 60 = 480 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the time she actually went to sleep that day**

She woke up **5 minutes earlier than usual**, so:

- Usual wake-up time: **6 a.m.**
- Actual wake-up time: **6:00 a.m. - 5 minutes = 5:55 a.m.**

Therefore, she **went to sleep at 10:00 p.m.**, as usual.

---

### **Step 3: Determine how long she was asleep before sleepwalking**

She **sleepwalked from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.**

That means she **was awake during that time**, not sleeping.

So, we need to subtract that time from her total sleep time.

First, calculate the duration of the sleepwalking episode:

$$
2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
$$

So, she was **awake for 23 minutes** (sleepwalking), and **not sleeping** during that time.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate total actual sleep time**

She normally sleeps for **480 minutes**, but she was **awake for 23 minutes** due to sleepwalking.

So, her **actual sleep time** that day is:

$$
480 \text{ minutes} - 23 \text{ minutes} = 457 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{457} \text{ minutes}
$$

Kim slept on her bed for **457 minutes** that day.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand what is given**

- Jonathan has **2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups**.
- He has **two dozen measuring cups**, which means:
  
  $$
  2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ measuring cups}
  $$

- He **gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons** for his birthday.

---

### **Step 2: Find the number of measuring spoons Jonathan originally had**

He has **2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups**, so:

$$
\text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = 16
$$

So, Jonathan originally has **16 measuring spoons**.

---

### **Step 3: Subtract the spoons he gave to Pedro**

He gives away **6 measuring spoons**, so:

$$
\text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate total number of utensils remaining**

Jonathan has:

- **24 measuring cups**
- **10 measuring spoons**

$$
\text{Total utensils remaining} = 24 + 10 = \boxed{34}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 34**
Let's break the problem down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Initial Occupancy**

The hospital has a total capacity of **1000 beds**.

Currently, **1/5** of the beds are occupied:

$$
\text{Occupied beds} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ beds}
$$

So, the number of **unoccupied beds** initially is:

$$
\text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 200 = 800 \text{ beds}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Patients Admitted Over 2 Weeks**

We are told that **50 patients are admitted each day**.

In **2 weeks**, there are:

$$
2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days}
$$

So, the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks is:

$$
50 \text{ patients/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 700 \text{ patients}
$$

These patients occupy **700 beds**.

---

### **Step 3: Total Occupied Beds After 2 Weeks**

Add the initial occupied beds to the new admissions:

$$
\text{Total occupied beds} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ beds}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total Unoccupied Beds After 2 Weeks**

Now subtract from the total bed capacity:

$$
\text{Unoccupied beds} = 1000 - 900 = \boxed{100} \text{ beds}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{100} \text{ unoccupied beds}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of emails
Robyn sends **16 emails a day**.

### Step 2: Work emails
She sends **7 work emails**.

So, the remaining emails are:
$$
16 - 7 = 9 \text{ emails}
$$

### Step 3: Emails to family
Two-thirds of the remainder (which is 9) go to **family**:
$$
\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \text{ emails to family}
$$

### Step 4: Remaining emails after family
Now subtract the emails to family from the remainder:
$$
9 - 6 = 3 \text{ emails left}
$$

### Step 5: Emails to her boyfriend
One-third of the **remaining** emails go to her boyfriend:
$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 3 = 1 \text{ email to her boyfriend}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Robyn sends 1 email a day to her boyfriend.**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find Aliya's age  
We are told:

> **Aliya is 3 years old.**

So,  
$$
\text{Aliya's age} = 3
$$

---

### Step 2: Find Shawna's age  
We are told:

> **Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya.**

So,  
$$
\text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9
$$

---

### Step 3: Find Shawna's father's age  
We are told:

> **Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna.**

So,  
$$
\text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{45}
$$
We are told:

- Courtney reported that the audience was **48 people**.
- Kelly said that Courtney **overstated** the number by **20%**.
- We are to find the **actual number of people** who attended the concert, assuming Kelly is correct.

---

### Step 1: Understand what "overstated by 20%" means

If Courtney **overstated** the number by 20%, that means her number (48) is **20% more than the actual number**.

Let’s call the **actual number of people** $ x $.

Then, according to Kelly:

$$
\text{Courtney's number} = \text{Actual number} + 20\% \text{ of actual number}
$$

So,

$$
48 = x + 0.2x = 1.2x
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

$$
1.2x = 48
$$

$$
x = \frac{48}{1.2} = 40
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{40}
$$

So, **40 people** actually attended the concert.
We are given the following information:

- Jordan carried **twice as many balls as Jason**.
- Jason carried **twice as many balls as Jeffrey**.
- **Jason carried 2 balls**.
- All the balls were picked up and carried by the three boys in **one trip**.

---

### Step 1: Assign variables based on relationships

Let’s define the number of balls each person carried:

- Let $ J $ be the number of balls **Jason** carried.  
  We are told:  
  $$
  J = 2
  $$

- Jordan carried **twice as many as Jason**, so:
  $$
  \text{Jordan} = 2 \times J = 2 \times 2 = 4
  $$

- Jason carried **twice as many as Jeffrey**, so:
  $$
  J = 2 \times \text{Jeffrey} \Rightarrow \text{Jeffrey} = \frac{J}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1
  $$

---

### Step 2: Add up all the balls

Now we add the number of balls each boy carried:

$$
\text{Total balls} = \text{Jordan} + \text{Jason} + \text{Jeffrey} = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{7}
$$

So, the coach brought **7 basketballs** to practice.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the digging progress**

The pirates dug holes over three days:

- **Day 1:** 10 holes  
- **Day 2:** 13 holes  
- **Day 3:** 8 holes

So, at the **end of Day 3**, they had dug:

$$
10 + 13 + 8 = 31 \text{ holes}
$$

However, on **Day 3**, they **filled in 2 holes** because they kept falling into them. So, the number of **holes remaining at the end of Day 3** is:

$$
31 - 2 = 29 \text{ holes}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Use the clue about total holes**

We are told that **by the time they found the treasure (on Day 4)**, the island had **four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day**.

From Step 1, we know:

- At the **end of Day 1**, there were **10 holes**.
- Therefore, by the time they found the treasure (at the **end of Day 4**), the island had:

$$
4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find how many holes were dug on Day 4**

At the **end of Day 3**, there were **29 holes**.  
By the **end of Day 4**, there were **40 holes**.

So, the number of holes dug on **Day 4** is:

$$
40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{11}
$$

The pirates dug **11 holes on the fourth day** before finding the treasure.
We are told:

- Amora and Lainey each got **70 corn chips**.
- Collins got **15 more** than what the others got.
- The total number of corn chips is to be found.

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ A = $ Amora's chips = 70
- $ L = $ Lainey's chips = 70
- $ C = $ Collins's chips = ?

We are told that **Collins got 15 more** than what the others got. So:

$$
C = A + L + 15
$$

But wait — this interpretation might not be correct. Let’s clarify the wording:

> "only two people would get an equal amount of corn chips, while the other person would receive 15 more corn chips than the number the others got."

So:
- Two people (Amora and Lainey) got the **same** amount.
- The third person (Collins) got **15 more** than what **the others** got.

That means:

$$
C = A + L + 15
$$

But since $ A = L = 70 $, then:

$$
C = 70 + 70 + 15 = 155
$$

---

### Step 2: Total number of corn chips

$$
\text{Total} = A + L + C = 70 + 70 + 155 = \boxed{295}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **295 corn chips altogether**.
Let's break the problem down step by step:

1. **Supplies cost:**  
   Jen pays **$400** for supplies.

2. **Travel tickets cost:**  
   The tickets cost **50% more** than the supplies.

3. **Calculate 50% of $400:**  
   $$
   50\% \text{ of } 400 = 0.5 \times 400 = 200
   $$

4. **Add that to the original supplies cost to get total travel cost:**  
   $$
   400 + 200 = 600
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$600**  
The travel tickets cost **$600** in total.
We are given the following information:

- **Total number of Pokémon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe together:** 339  
- **Alex has caught 5 more than Stan**  
- **Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe**

Let’s define variables for each person:

- Let **A** be the number of Pokémon **Adelwolfe** caught.
- Then **Stan** caught: $ S = 4A - 13 $
- And **Alex** caught: $ X = S + 5 = (4A - 13) + 5 = 4A - 8 $

Now we know the total is 339:

$$
A + S + X = 339
$$

Substitute in terms of A:

$$
A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8) = 339
$$

Simplify:

$$
A + 4A - 13 + 4A - 8 = 339 \\
(1A + 4A + 4A) + (-13 - 8) = 339 \\
9A - 21 = 339
$$

Add 21 to both sides:

$$
9A = 360
$$

Divide both sides by 9:

$$
A = 40
$$

Now find how many Pokémon **Stan** caught:

$$
S = 4A - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Stan has caught 147 Pokémon.**
We are given the following information:

- Each episode is **20 minutes** long.
- There are **half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode**.

Let’s define variables to help us solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define Variables

Let:
- $ E $ = number of episodes
- $ M $ = number of minutes per episode (which is 20)

We are told:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}M
$$

But we also know:

$$
M = 20
$$

---

### Step 2: Plug in the value for $ M $

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
$$

So, there are **10 episodes** in total.

---

### Step 3: Find total time spent watching

Each episode is 20 minutes, and there are 10 episodes:

$$
\text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{200} \text{ minutes}
$$
We are given the bird's journey in three parts, and we need to find the **total distance between her northern home and southern home**. To do this, we will calculate how far she traveled in each direction and then find the net displacement.

---

### Step 1: Calculate distance for each leg of the trip

#### **First leg (south)**:
- Time: 10 hours  
- Speed: 30 mph  
- Distance = speed × time = $ 30 \times 10 = 300 $ miles **south**

#### **Second leg (north)**:
- Time: 2 hours  
- Speed: 18 mph  
- Distance = $ 18 \times 2 = 36 $ miles **north**

#### **Third leg (south)**:
- Time: 5 hours  
- Speed: 22 mph  
- Distance = $ 22 \times 5 = 110 $ miles **south**

---

### Step 2: Determine total displacement

Now we'll consider directions:

- Southward distances: $ 300 + 110 = 410 $ miles
- Northward distance: $ 36 $ miles

So the net movement is:

$$
\text{Net displacement} = 410 - 36 = 374 \text{ miles south}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{374} \text{ miles}
$$

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is **374 miles**.
Let's solve this step by step to find out how many **individual brownies** Greta had left over from the entire day.

---

### Step 1: Understand the units
We are dealing with **dozens**, and we need to convert everything into **individual brownies** at the end.  
Remember:  
> 1 dozen = 12 brownies

---

### Step 2: List all the brownies received or used

1. **Greta made for herself:**  
   - 1 dozen = 12 brownies

2. **From her office party:**  
   - ½ dozen = (½ × 12) = **6 brownies**

3. **From her friends at home:**  
   - 4 dozen = (4 × 12) = **48 brownies**

4. **During the party, eaten:**  
   - 1½ dozen = (1.5 × 12) = **18 brownies**

---

### Step 3: Add up all the brownies she had

Total brownies =  
(12 + 6 + 48) = **66 brownies**

---

### Step 4: Subtract the ones that were eaten

Brownies left =  
66 – 18 = **48 brownies**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.**
Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Nani's age**:  
   Nani is **8 years old**.

2. **His brother's age**:  
   His brother is **twice** Nani's age.  
   So,  
   $$
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old}
   $$

3. **Nani's sister's age**:  
   She is **25% younger** than Nani.  
   To find 25% of Nani's age:  
   $$
   0.25 \times 8 = 2
   $$  
   So, she is **2 years younger** than Nani:  
   $$
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old}
   $$

4. **Total age of all three**:  
   $$
   8 + 16 + 6 = 30
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **30 years**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how long it will take Andy to string all the racquets.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the breakdown of racquets**

- **Synthetic gut:** 3 racquets  
- **Polyester:** 5 racquets  
- **Hybrid (half synthetic, half polyester):** 4 racquets

> Note: For hybrid sets, since they are strung with both types of string, we assume that **each racquet takes the time for both types of stringing**, or that the time given for hybrid is already the total time for one racquet. We'll clarify this in Step 2.

---

### **Step 2: Interpret the time per type of stringing**

The problem says:

- Synthetic gut: **15 minutes per racquet**
- Polyester: **22 minutes per racquet**
- Hybrid: **18 minutes per racquet**

This means:
- A **hybrid set** takes **18 minutes total** per racquet (not 18 minutes per string type).
- So we don't need to split the time between synthetic and polyester for hybrid racquets — it’s a **single time** for the whole racquet.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total time for each type**

#### **Synthetic Gut:**
$$
3 \text{ racquets} \times 15 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 45 \text{ minutes}
$$

#### **Polyester:**
$$
5 \text{ racquets} \times 22 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 110 \text{ minutes}
$$

#### **Hybrid:**
$$
4 \text{ racquets} \times 18 \text{ minutes/racquet} = 72 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add up all the times**

$$
45 + 110 + 72 = 227 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

It will take Andy **227 minutes** to string all the racquets.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many phones John is buying
John is buying phones for:
- Himself  
- His wife  
- His 2 kids  

So that’s **4 phones total**.

---

### Step 2: Understand the pricing structure
- The **first 2 phones are full price**.
- Each phone **after the first 2 is half price**.

The **full price of each phone is $600**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of each phone

- **First 2 phones (full price):**  
  $ 2 \times 600 = 1200 $

- **Next 2 phones (half price):**  
  Half of $600 is $300.  
  $ 2 \times 300 = 600 $

---

### Step 4: Add them all together

$$
1200 + 600 = 1800
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**John paid $1800 for all the phones.**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Carlton's team has **13 players**.
- Zeke's team has **7 more players** than Carlton's team.

### Step 2: Find the number of players on Zeke's team
Zeke's team = Carlton's team + 7  
Zeke's team = 13 + 7 = **20 players**

### Step 3: Find the total number of players in both teams combined
Total players = Carlton's team + Zeke's team  
Total players = 13 + 20 = **33 players**

### ✅ Final Answer:
**33 players** in total.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular fence
Robert is building a **rectangular fence** that is:
- **Length = 15 feet**
- **Width = 10 feet**

The **perimeter** of a rectangle is given by the formula:

$$
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
$$

$$
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (15 + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ feet}
$$

So, the total length of fencing needed is **50 feet**.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many wooden slats are needed
Robert needs **2 wood slats for every foot of fencing**.

$$
\text{Total number of slats} = 2 \times \text{Perimeter}
$$

$$
\text{Total number of slats} = 2 \times 50 = 100
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Robert will need 100 wooden slats.**
Let's solve this step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Total number of boxes**
Mrs. Harrington bought **12 boxes** of oranges.

---

### **Step 2: Boxes given away**
She gave **2 boxes** to her mom and **2 boxes** to her sister.

So, total boxes given away =  
$$
2 + 2 = 4 \text{ boxes}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Boxes remaining**
Total boxes - boxes given away =  
$$
12 - 4 = 8 \text{ boxes}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Oranges in each box**
Each box contains **20 oranges**, so total oranges in the remaining boxes is:  
$$
8 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 160 \text{ oranges}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Oranges kept and sold**
She **kept 1/4** of the oranges and sold the rest.

First, find how many oranges she **kept**:
$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 160 = 40 \text{ oranges}
$$

Now, subtract the oranges she kept from the total to find how many she **sold**:
$$
160 - 40 = 120 \text{ oranges}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{120} \text{ oranges}
$$
We are given:

- India has **4 more than half the number of states in the USA**.
- We need to find the **total number of states in both countries together**.

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ x $ = number of states in the USA  
- $ y $ = number of states in India

We know from the problem that:

$$
y = \frac{1}{2}x + 4
$$

Also, we know from real-world data that the **USA has 50 states**. So:

$$
x = 50
$$

---

### Step 2: Plug in the value of $ x $ into the equation for $ y $

$$
y = \frac{1}{2}(50) + 4 = 25 + 4 = 29
$$

So, India has **29 states**.

---

### Step 3: Find the total number of states in both countries

$$
\text{Total} = x + y = 50 + 29 = 79
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{79}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Find the total cost of the books:**
- Dictionary: $18  
- Dinosaur book: $13  
- Children's cookbook: $8  

**Total cost =**  
$$
18 + 13 + 8 = 39
$$

So, Tyler needs **$39** in total.

---

### 2. **How much money does Tyler already have?**

He has saved **$14** from his allowance.

---

### 3. **How much more money does Tyler need?**

$$
39 - 14 = 25
$$

Tyler needs an additional **$25**.

---

### 4. **How much does Tyler earn per hour?**

He earns **$5 per hour**.

---

### 5. **How many hours does he need to work to earn $25?**

$$
\frac{25}{5} = 5
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Tyler needs to work **5 hours** to afford his books.
We are given the following information:

- Total cherries = 60  
- Robert has **30** cherries.  
- Robert has **10 more** cherries than Richard.  
- We are to find how many **more cherries Robert has than Jerry**.

---

### Step 1: Find how many cherries Richard has

We know:
$$
\text{Robert} = \text{Richard} + 10
$$
$$
30 = \text{Richard} + 10
$$
$$
\text{Richard} = 30 - 10 = 20
$$

So, **Richard has 20 cherries**.

---

### Step 2: Find how many cherries Jerry has

We know the total number of cherries is 60. So:

$$
\text{Robert} + \text{Richard} + \text{Jerry} = 60
$$
$$
30 + 20 + \text{Jerry} = 60
$$
$$
50 + \text{Jerry} = 60
$$
$$
\text{Jerry} = 60 - 50 = 10
$$

So, **Jerry has 10 cherries**.

---

### Step 3: Find how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry

$$
\text{Robert} - \text{Jerry} = 30 - 10 = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{20}
$$

Robert has **20 more cherries** than Jerry.
Let's break the problem down step by step and solve it carefully.

---

### **Step 1: Define variables for sales**

We are given information about how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on **Saturday** and **Sunday**. Let’s define:

- Let **G_S** = number of gingerbread boxes sold on Saturday  
- Let **A_S** = number of apple pie boxes sold on Saturday  
- Let **G_U** = number of gingerbread boxes sold on Sunday  
- Let **A_U** = number of apple pie boxes sold on Sunday  

---

### **Step 2: Use the given information to set up equations**

From the problem:

1. **On Saturday**, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread:
   $$
   G_S = 10
   $$

2. **On Saturday**, he sold **4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday**:
   $$
   A_S = A_U - 4
   $$

3. **On Sunday**, he sold **5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday**:
   $$
   G_U = G_S + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15
   $$

4. **On Sunday**, he sold **15 boxes of apple pie**:
   $$
   A_U = 15
   $$

Now we can find **A_S** using equation (2):
$$
A_S = A_U - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11
$$

So now we have all the values:

- **Saturday**:  
  - Gingerbread: 10 boxes  
  - Apple pie: 11 boxes  
- **Sunday**:  
  - Gingerbread: 15 boxes  
  - Apple pie: 15 boxes  

---

### **Step 3: Calculate total earnings**

The prices are:

- Gingerbread: $6 per box  
- Apple pie: $15 per box

#### **Saturday Earnings**:
- Gingerbread: $10 \times 6 = 60$ dollars  
- Apple pie: $11 \times 15 = 165$ dollars  
- Total on Saturday: $60 + 165 = 225$ dollars

#### **Sunday Earnings**:
- Gingerbread: $15 \times 6 = 90$ dollars  
- Apple pie: $15 \times 15 = 225$ dollars  
- Total on Sunday: $90 + 225 = 315$ dollars

---

### **Step 4: Add both days' earnings**

$$
\text{Total earnings} = 225 + 315 = \boxed{540}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$540}
$$
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how much sunscreen Pamela uses per day**

- She applies **1 ounce of sunscreen every hour**.
- She is outside **4 hours a day**.
  
So, sunscreen used per day =  
$$
1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours/day} = 4 \text{ ounces/day}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total sunscreen needed for 8 days**

Total sunscreen needed =  
$$
4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine how many 8-ounce bottles she needs**

Each bottle contains **8 ounces**.

Number of bottles needed =  
$$
\frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the information
- The **blue car** costs **$100**.
- The **red car** is **40% cheaper** than the blue car.

### Step 2: Find the price of the red car
If the red car is 40% cheaper, that means it costs **60% of the blue car's price** (since 100% - 40% = 60%).

So:
$$
\text{Price of red car} = 60\% \times 100 = 0.60 \times 100 = 60
$$

### Step 3: Add the prices of both cars
$$
\text{Total cost} = \text{Price of blue car} + \text{Price of red car} = 100 + 60 = 160
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$160}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Define variables
Let:
- $ E = $ Emil's current age = **19**
- $ D = $ Dad's current age (unknown)
- $ B = $ Brother's current age (unknown)

We are told that **when Emil turns 24**, he will be:
- Half the age of his dad
- Twice as old as his brother

So, first, let's figure out **how many years from now** Emil will turn 24.

$$
24 - 19 = 5 \text{ years from now}
$$

---

### Step 2: Express future ages

In 5 years:
- Emil will be $ 19 + 5 = 24 $
- Dad will be $ D + 5 $
- Brother will be $ B + 5 $

From the problem:
- When Emil is 24, he will be **half the age of his dad**:
  $$
  24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)
  $$

- Also, when Emil is 24, he will be **twice as old as his brother**:
  $$
  24 = 2(B + 5)
  $$

---

### Step 3: Solve for Dad’s age

From the first equation:

$$
24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5) \\
\Rightarrow 48 = D + 5 \\
\Rightarrow D = 43
$$

So, **Dad is currently 43 years old**.

---

### Step 4: Solve for Brother’s age

From the second equation:

$$
24 = 2(B + 5) \\
\Rightarrow 12 = B + 5 \\
\Rightarrow B = 7
$$

So, **Brother is currently 7 years old**.

---

### Step 5: Find the sum of their current ages

$$
\text{Sum} = D + B = 43 + 7 = \boxed{50}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{50}
$$
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Beads from her mother**:  
   Adrianne's mother gave her **20** metallic beads.

2. **Beads from her sister**:  
   Her sister gave her **10 more beads than her mother**.  
   So, that’s:  
   $ 20 + 10 = 30 $ beads.

3. **Beads from her friend**:  
   Her friend gave her **twice as many as her mother**.  
   So, that’s:  
   $ 2 \times 20 = 40 $ beads.

4. **Total beads**:  
   Now, add all the beads together:  
   $ 20 + 30 + 40 = 90 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **90 beads**.
Let's break the problem down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Crawfish caught on Thursday  
Joe caught **3 pounds** of crawfish on Thursday.

---

### Step 2: Crawfish caught on Friday  
He caught **4 times** that amount on Friday.  
So,  
$$
\text{Friday's catch} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 3: Crawfish caught on Saturday  
He caught **half the amount** of his Friday's catch on Saturday.  
So,  
$$
\text{Saturday's catch} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total crawfish caught  
Now, add up all the crawfish from the three days:  
$$
\text{Total} = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### Step 5: Convert to servings  
Each serving is **3 pounds** of crawfish.  
So,  
$$
\text{Number of servings} = \frac{21}{3} = 7
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**7 servings** of crawfish.
Let's break the problem down step by step:

### Step 1: Total number of students
Mr. Roper's class has **30 students**.

---

### Step 2: Football players
- **20%** of the class are football players.
- To find how many students that is:
  $$
  20\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.20 \times 30 = 6 \text{ students}
  $$

So, **6 students** are football players and will leave early.

---

### Step 3: Remaining students
After removing the football players:
$$
30 - 6 = 24 \text{ students remain}
$$

---

### Step 4: Cheerleaders or part of band
- Out of the **remaining 24 students**, **25%** are cheerleaders or part of the band.
- To find how many that is:
  $$
  25\% \text{ of } 24 = 0.25 \times 24 = 6 \text{ students}
  $$

So, **6 more students** are cheerleaders or part of the band and will also leave early.

---

### Step 5: Total number of students leaving early
Add the football players and the cheerleaders/band members:
$$
6 + 6 = 12 \text{ students}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{12} \text{ students are leaving early}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Sophie's boot size:**  
   Sophie wears size **5** boots.

2. **Charlie's boot size:**  
   Charlie's boots are **five times the size** of Sophie's.  
   So, Charlie's boot size = $ 5 \times 5 = 25 $.

3. **Average size of shoes worn by the two:**  
   The average is calculated by adding their sizes and dividing by 2:

   $$
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sophie's size} + \text{Charlie's size}}{2} = \frac{5 + 25}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **15**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Convert the flower bed length to inches**

Pat's flower bed is **111 feet long**.  
Since **1 foot = 12 inches**, we convert:

$$
111 \text{ feet} \times 12 = 1332 \text{ inches}
$$

So, the total length of the flower bed is **1332 inches**.

---

### **Step 2: Understand the spacing requirement**

Each plant grows **12 inches wide**, and there must be **1.5 feet between every plant**.

First, convert **1.5 feet** to inches:

$$
1.5 \text{ feet} = 1.5 \times 12 = 18 \text{ inches}
$$

So, each plant requires **12 inches (width) + 18 inches (space)** = **30 inches per plant**.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how many plants can fit in the flower bed**

Now divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant takes:

$$
\frac{1332}{30} = 44.4
$$

Since you can't have a fraction of a plant, **Pat can only fit 44 full plants** in the flower bed.

---

### **Step 4: Determine how many additional plants Pat needs to buy**

Pat already owns **17 flowers**, so she needs:

$$
44 - 17 = 27 \text{ more plants}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Calculate the cost of the additional plants**

Each plant costs **$6**, so:

$$
27 \times 6 = 162
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$162}
$$

Pat will spend **\$162** at the store to fill up her flower bed.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day.**  
2. **His brother eats 1/2 as many pretzels as Edgar.**  
   - So, we calculate:  
     $$
     \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
     $$  
   - That means the brother eats **9 pretzels a day**.

3. **We need to find out how many pretzels the brother eats in a week.**  
   - A week has **7 days**, so:  
     $$
     9 \text{ pretzels/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 63 \text{ pretzels}
     $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **63 pretzels**

---

### Step 1: Determine the number of each plant per basket

- **Petunias per basket:** 3  
- **Sweet potato vines per basket:** 2  

---

### Step 2: Calculate the cost per basket

- **Cost of petunias per basket:**  
  $ 3 \text{ petunias} \times \$3.00 = \$9.00 $

- **Cost of sweet potato vines per basket:**  
  $ 2 \text{ vines} \times \$2.50 = \$5.00 $

- **Total cost per basket:**  
  $ \$9.00 + \$5.00 = \$14.00 $

---

### Step 3: Multiply by the number of baskets

Katherine has **5** baskets:

- **Total cost for all baskets:**  
  $ 5 \text{ baskets} \times \$14.00 = \$70.00 $

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**

- Total soil available: **30 pounds**
- Each **rose** needs **1 pound** of soil  
- Each **carnation** needs **1.5 pounds** of soil  
- Each **sunflower** needs **3 pounds** of soil  
- They plant:
  - **4 sunflowers**
  - **10 carnations**
- We are to find out how many **roses** they can plant with the remaining soil.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the soil used by sunflowers and carnations**

#### **Sunflowers:**
- 4 sunflowers × 3 pounds each = **12 pounds**

#### **Carnations:**
- 10 carnations × 1.5 pounds each = **15 pounds**

---

### **Step 3: Add up the soil used so far**

- Sunflowers: 12 pounds  
- Carnations: 15 pounds  
- **Total used = 12 + 15 = 27 pounds**

---

### **Step 4: Subtract from total soil to find remaining soil**

- Total soil: 30 pounds  
- Used soil: 27 pounds  
- **Remaining soil = 30 - 27 = 3 pounds**

---

### **Step 5: Determine how many roses can be planted with the remaining soil**

- Each rose uses **1 pound** of soil  
- Remaining soil = **3 pounds**

So, they can plant:

$$
\frac{3 \text{ pounds}}{1 \text{ pound per rose}} = \boxed{3} \text{ roses}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**They can plant 3 roses.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many pairs of shoes Jessica can buy in a year.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate Jessica's monthly savings for shoes**

Jessica makes **$2,000.00 per month** and sets aside **25%** of her paycheck for shoes.

$$
\text{Monthly savings} = 25\% \times 2000 = 0.25 \times 2000 = 500
$$

So, she saves **$500 per month** for shoes.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate her annual savings for shoes**

$$
\text{Annual savings} = 500 \times 12 = 6000
$$

Jessica saves **$6,000 per year** for shoes.

---

### **Step 3: Determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy**

Each pair of shoes costs **$1,000**.

$$
\text{Number of shoes} = \frac{\text{Annual savings}}{\text{Cost per pair}} = \frac{6000}{1000} = 6
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Jessica can buy **6 pairs of shoes** in a year.
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how long it takes Emily to peel 90 shrimp.**

Emily can peel **6 shrimp per minute**.

So, the time required to peel 90 shrimp is:

$$
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how long it takes Emily to sauté 90 shrimp.**

We are told that Emily can sauté **30 shrimp in 10 minutes**, which means her sauté rate is:

$$
\text{Sauté rate} = \frac{30 \text{ shrimp}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 3 \text{ shrimp per minute}
$$

Now, to sauté 90 shrimp:

$$
\text{Time to sauté} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add the two times together.**

$$
\text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to sauté} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = \boxed{45 \text{ minutes}}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**It will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.**
Let's break this down step by step to determine how many degrees lower than the starting temperature the final temperature is.

---

### **Step 1: Define the rate of cooling and warming**

- **Cooling on low**: -2 degrees per hour  
- **Cooling on high**: -3 degrees per hour  
- **Warming (no AC)**: +2 degrees per hour  

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the temperature change for each time period**

#### **Part 1: Air conditioner on low for 3 hours**
- Rate: -2 degrees/hour  
- Time: 3 hours  
- Change in temperature:  
  $$
  -2 \times 3 = -6 \text{ degrees}
  $$

#### **Part 2: Air conditioner on high for 4 hours**
- Rate: -3 degrees/hour  
- Time: 4 hours  
- Change in temperature:  
  $$
  -3 \times 4 = -12 \text{ degrees}
  $$

#### **Part 3: No air conditioner (warming) for 2 hours**
- Rate: +2 degrees/hour  
- Time: 2 hours  
- Change in temperature:  
  $$
  +2 \times 2 = +4 \text{ degrees}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Total temperature change**

Add up all the changes:

$$
-6 \text{ (low)} + (-12) \text{ (high)} + 4 \text{ (warming)} = -14 \text{ degrees}
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**

The final temperature is **14 degrees lower** than the starting temperature.

$$
\boxed{14} \text{ degrees lower}
$$
We are given the following information:

- **Comet Halley orbits the Sun every 75 years.**
- **Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old.**
- **Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the comet (i.e., 3 × 30 = 90 years old).**
- We are to find: **How old was Bill when he saw the Comet for the first time?**

---

### Step 1: Understand the timing

Since the comet appears every **75 years**, and Bill saw it **a second time** when he was **90 years old**, that means:

- The **first time** Bill saw the comet must have been **75 years earlier**.
- So, Bill's **first sighting** occurred at age:
  $$
  90 - 75 = 15 \text{ years old}
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{15}
$$

Bill was **15 years old** when he saw the comet for the first time.
Let's break down how many checks Buford writes each month and then calculate the total for a year.

---

### 1. **Electric Bill**
- **Once per month** → 1 check/month  
- In a year:  
  $ 1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ checks/year} $

---

### 2. **Gas Bill**
- **Once per month** → 1 check/month  
- In a year:  
  $ 1 \text{ check/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 12 \text{ checks/year} $

---

### 3. **Church**
- **Twice per month** → 2 checks/month  
- In a year:  
  $ 2 \text{ checks/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 24 \text{ checks/year} $

---

### 4. **Pest and Lawn Service**
- **Quarterly** → once every 3 months  
- In a year:  
  $ 1 \text{ check/quarter} \times 4 \text{ quarters} = 4 \text{ checks/year} $

---

### Total Checks Per Year:
$$
12 (\text{electric}) + 12 (\text{gas}) + 24 (\text{church}) + 4 (\text{pest/lawn}) = 52 \text{ checks/year}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Buford writes 52 checks per year.**
We are given the following information about two planes at an airport:

---

### Let’s define variables:

Let:
- $ x $ = number of flights made by the **first plane** in one day.

We are told:

1. The **first plane** goes to **Greece** for **three-quarters** of its flights.
   - So, flights to Greece = $ \frac{3}{4}x $

2. The remaining flights (i.e., $ x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x $) are **split equally between France and Germany**.
   - So, flights to France = $ \frac{1}{8}x $
   - Flights to Germany = $ \frac{1}{8}x $

3. The **second plane** flies **only to Poland**, and it makes **44 trips per day**.

4. These 44 trips are **half** the number of trips made by the first plane in a day.

So, from point 4:
$$
\frac{1}{2}x = 44 \Rightarrow x = 88
$$

---

### Now, we can find how many flights the **first plane** takes to **France**:

From earlier:
- Flights to France = $ \frac{1}{8}x $

Plug in $ x = 88 $:
$$
\text{Flights to France} = \frac{1}{8} \times 88 = 11
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{11}
$$

So, the **first plane takes 11 flights to France in one day**.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Define the time each wolf howls
- **Tobias** howls for **20 seconds**.
- **Chikote** howls for **twice as long as Tobias**, so:
  $$
  \text{Chikote} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ seconds}
  $$
- **Igneous** howls for **as long as the other two combined**, so:
  $$
  \text{Igneous} = \text{Tobias} + \text{Chikote} = 20 + 40 = 60 \text{ seconds}
  $$

### Step 2: Add up all the howling times
$$
\text{Total time} = 20 + 40 + 60 = 120 \text{ seconds}
$$

### Step 3: Convert seconds to minutes
$$
120 \text{ seconds} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{2} \text{ minutes}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Cost of the trousers**: $30  
2. **Money from mother**: $6  
3. **Money from father**: Twice as much as mother → $6 × 2 = **$12**  
4. **Total money from parents**: $6 (mother) + $12 (father) = **$18**

Now, subtract the total money from parents from the cost of the trousers to find out how much Adam had to contribute from his savings:

$$
\text{Adam's contribution} = \text{Cost of trousers} - \text{Money from parents}
$$
$$
= 30 - 18 = \boxed{12}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$12**
We are given the following information:

- There are **four children**: Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred.
- **Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group.**
- The **total age of the children is 20 years**.
- **Akbar is 3 years old**.
- **Alessandro is 4 years old**.

We are to find the **age of Wilfred**.

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ A = $ Akbar's age = 3
- $ B = $ Alessandro's age = 4
- $ H = $ Helene's age (unknown)
- $ W = $ Wilfred's age (what we want to find)

We are told that the **total age of the four children is 20**:

$$
A + B + H + W = 20
$$

Substitute known values:

$$
3 + 4 + H + W = 20
$$

$$
7 + H + W = 20
$$

$$
H + W = 13 \tag{1}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the fact that Helene is twice the average age

The **average age** of the group is:

$$
\text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Total age}}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
$$

So, **Helene is twice the average age**:

$$
H = 2 \times 5 = 10
$$

---

### Step 3: Plug into equation (1) to solve for Wilfred

From equation (1):

$$
H + W = 13
$$

Now substitute $ H = 10 $:

$$
10 + W = 13
$$

$$
W = 3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Wilfred is 3 years old.**
Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute.

---

### Step 1: Understand what has already been collected

- **From neighbors:** $500  
- **From online fund:** $1500  

So, total collected so far =  
$$
500 + 1500 = 2000
$$

---

### Step 2: Understand the lawyer's contribution

The lawyer offers to donate **three times as much as everyone else donates**.

This means:

$$
\text{Lawyer's contribution} = 3 \times (\text{Total from neighbors and online fund})
$$

We already calculated that total from neighbors and online fund is **$2000**, so:

$$
\text{Lawyer's contribution} = 3 \times 2000 = 6000
$$

---

### Step 3: Does the friend’s $200 affect this?

The problem says:  
> "Walter is going to tell him about his neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well."

This suggests that the **friend will give $200**, but it doesn't say the lawyer's contribution depends on that. The lawyer's offer is based on the amount **already collected** (from neighbors and online fund), not on future donations.

So, the **$200 from the friend does not change the lawyer’s contribution**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{6000}
$$

Walter's lawyer is going to contribute **$6000**.
Let's break the problem down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Total number of cookies**

- There are **100 guests** at the wedding.
- Each guest brought a plate of **15 cookies**.

So, total number of cookies is:

$$
100 \text{ guests} \times 15 \text{ cookies per guest} = 1500 \text{ cookies}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Cookies given to the church**

- The bride gave **1/2** of the cookies to the church.

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750 \text{ cookies}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Number of people in the church**

- Each person in the church got **15 cookies**.

So, the number of people who received cookies is:

$$
\frac{750 \text{ cookies}}{15 \text{ cookies per person}} = 50 \text{ people}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{50}
$$

There were **50 people** in the church next door.
We are given:

- A watermelon is to be divided among **6 people**:  
  - **2 adults**  
  - **4 kids**

- Each **adult gets a slice that is twice as big as each kid's slice**.

We are to find: **What percentage of the watermelon does each adult get?**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let the size of one **kid's slice** be $ x $.  
Then, the size of one **adult's slice** is $ 2x $.

---

### Step 2: Total number of slices

- 4 kids → 4 slices of size $ x $
- 2 adults → 2 slices of size $ 2x $

So total watermelon =  
$$
4x + 2(2x) = 4x + 4x = 8x
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets

Each adult gets a slice of size $ 2x $, and the total watermelon is $ 8x $.

So the **percentage** of the watermelon that **each adult gets** is:

$$
\frac{2x}{8x} \times 100 = \frac{2}{8} \times 100 = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.**
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records.

---

### **Total time available on Monday:**
- **9 hours**

---

### **Time spent on rounds:**
- He has **9 inpatients**.
- Each round takes **20 minutes**.
- Total time for rounds =  
  $$
  9 \text{ inpatients} \times 20 \text{ minutes per inpatient} = 180 \text{ minutes}
  $$

Convert to hours:
$$
180 \text{ minutes} = \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Time spent on appointments:**
- He has **10 appointments**.
- Each appointment takes **30 minutes**.
- Total time for appointments =  
  $$
  10 \times 30 = 300 \text{ minutes}
  $$

Convert to hours:
$$
300 \text{ minutes} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Total time spent on rounds and appointments:**
$$
3 \text{ hours (rounds)} + 5 \text{ hours (appointments)} = 8 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Time left for updating records:**
$$
9 \text{ hours (total)} - 8 \text{ hours (used)} = 1 \text{ hour}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.**
Let's break this down step by step to figure out the **latest time Jordan can start** making the cake so that it is ready to serve at **5:00 pm**.

---

### **Step 1: Total Time Required**

We need to add up all the time steps:

- **Making the batter:** 20 minutes  
- **Baking the cake:** 30 minutes  
- **Cooling the cake:** 2 hours = 120 minutes  
- **Frosting the cake:** 10 minutes  

**Total time required** =  
20 + 30 + 120 + 10 = **180 minutes**  
= **3 hours**

---

### **Step 2: Determine the Latest Start Time**

Jordan wants the cake ready to be served at **5:00 pm**.  
She needs **3 hours** to complete everything.

So, she must start **3 hours before 5:00 pm**.

**5:00 pm minus 3 hours = 2:00 pm**

---

### ✅ **Answer:**

Jordan can start making the cake as late as **2:00 pm** to have it ready for serving at **5:00 pm**.
We are told:

- Lisa sold **three and a half boxes** of chocolate bars.
- Peter sold **four and a half boxes** of chocolate bars.
- Together, they sold **64 chocolate bars**.
- We need to find: **How many chocolate bars are in a box?**

---

### Step 1: Convert mixed numbers to improper fractions

- Lisa sold: $ 3 \frac{1}{2} = \frac{7}{2} $ boxes
- Peter sold: $ 4 \frac{1}{2} = \frac{9}{2} $ boxes

---

### Step 2: Add the total number of boxes sold

$$
\frac{7}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ boxes}
$$

So together, they sold **8 boxes** of chocolate bars.

---

### Step 3: Use the total number of chocolate bars to find how many per box

They sold **64 chocolate bars** in total, and that was across **8 boxes**.

$$
\text{Number of bars per box} = \frac{64}{8} = 8
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{8}
$$

There are **8 chocolate bars in a box**.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find the **expected earnings** of the dance studio in a month.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the costs and pricing**

- **Fixed cost per session**: $25  
- **Variable cost per student per session**: $1.50  
- **Number of students**: 10  
- **Sessions per week**: 3  
- **Weeks in a month**: Typically, we assume **4 weeks** in a month (unless specified otherwise)

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total cost per session**

Each session has two components:

- **Fixed cost**: $25  
- **Variable cost**:  
  $$
  10 \text{ students} \times \$1.50 = \$15
  $$

So, **total cost per session** is:
$$
\$25 + \$15 = \$40
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate weekly earnings**

The studio rents the studio **3 days a week**, so there are **3 sessions per week**.

$$
\text{Weekly earnings} = 3 \text{ sessions/week} \times \$40/\text{session} = \$120
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate monthly earnings**

Assuming **4 weeks per month**:

$$
\text{Monthly earnings} = 4 \text{ weeks/month} \times \$120/\text{week} = \$480
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$480}
$$

So, the **expected earnings of the dance studio in a month** are **\$480**.
We are given:

- Peter has **4 boxes**, and the **total** number of chocolate bars he has is **64**.
- Martha has **7 boxes**, and the **total** number of chocolate bars she has is **56**.

We are asked:  
**How many more chocolate bars does Peter have in each box than Martha?**

---

### Step 1: Find how many chocolate bars are in each of Peter's boxes

Peter has 4 boxes with a total of 64 chocolate bars.  
So, the number of chocolate bars per box for Peter is:

$$
\frac{64}{4} = 16
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many chocolate bars are in each of Martha's boxes

Martha has 7 boxes with a total of 56 chocolate bars.  
So, the number of chocolate bars per box for Martha is:

$$
\frac{56}{7} = 8
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the difference between the number of chocolate bars per box

$$
16 - 8 = 8
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total population of porcupines**
We are told:
- The total population is **50** porcupines.

---

### **Step 2: Number of female porcupines**
The number of female porcupines is **3/5** of the total population.

$$
\text{Number of females} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
$$

So, there are **30 female porcupines**.

---

### **Step 3: Number of babies born per month**
Each female gives birth to **4 babies every month**.

$$
\text{Babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
$$

So, **120 new porcupines are born each month**.

---

### **Step 4: Number of months in a year**
There are **12 months** in a year.

$$
\text{Total babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
$$

---

### **Step 5: Total population after a year**
We start with **50 porcupines**, and **1440 new ones are born** during the year.

$$
\text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = \boxed{1490}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{1490}
$$ porcupines will be in the park after a year.
Let's solve this step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Find the volume of the pool**

The pool is a rectangular prism, so we use the formula for volume:

$$
\text{Volume} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
$$

Given:
- Length = 25 feet  
- Width = 14 feet  
- Depth = 4 feet  

$$
\text{Volume} = 25 \times 14 \times 4 = 1400 \text{ cubic feet}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Convert cubic feet to gallons**

The company told them to multiply the volume (in cubic feet) by **5.9** to get the number of gallons.

$$
\text{Gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the cost**

The cost is **$0.10 per gallon**.

$$
\text{Cost} = 8260 \times 0.10 = \$826
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$826}
$$

It will cost **\$826** to fill the pool.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Number of red sticks
We are told:
- There are **9 red sticks**.

### Step 2: Number of blue sticks
We are told:
- There are **5 more blue sticks than red sticks**.

So, the number of blue sticks is:
$$
9 + 5 = 14
$$

### Step 3: Number of yellow sticks
We are told:
- The number of yellow sticks is **3 less than the blue sticks**.

So, the number of yellow sticks is:
$$
14 - 3 = 11
$$

### Step 4: Total number of sticks
Now, add up all the sticks:
$$
\text{Red} + \text{Blue} + \text{Yellow} = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{34}
$$

They have **34 sticks** in total.
To find how many miles farther Shandy drove than Matteo, we need to calculate the distance each person traveled and then find the difference.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the distance Matteo traveled

Matteo's speed = 55 miles per hour  
Matteo's time = 4 hours  

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 55 \times 4 = 220 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the distance Shandy traveled

Shandy's speed = 45 miles per hour  
Shandy's time = 10 hours  

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 45 \times 10 = 450 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the difference in distance

$$
\text{Difference} = 450 - 220 = 230 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.**
We are given the following information:

- Total number of students = **3000**
- Half of the students are **over 16 years old**:  
  $$
  \frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
  $$

- One-fourth of the students over 16 are **male**:
  $$
  \frac{1}{4} \times 1500 = 375 \text{ males}
  $$

- Therefore, the number of **female students over 16** is:
  $$
  1500 - 375 = 1125
  $$

Now, the remaining half of the students are **under 16 years old**:
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 3000 = 1500
$$

- One-half of the students under 16 are **male**:
  $$
  \frac{1}{2} \times 1500 = 750 \text{ males}
  $$

- Therefore, the number of **female students under 16** is:
  $$
  1500 - 750 = 750
  $$

### Total number of female students:
$$
1125 \text{ (over 16)} + 750 \text{ (under 16)} = 1875
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **1875 female students**.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many laps Bethany can run in one hour.
> **Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.**

So,  
**Bethany = 10 laps/hour**

---

### Step 2: Find out how many laps Trey can run.
> **Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.**

$$
\text{Trey} = \text{Bethany} + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14 \text{ laps/hour}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find out how many laps Shaelyn can run.
> **Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.**

$$
\text{Shaelyn} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Trey} = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \text{ laps/hour}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find out how many laps Quinn can run.
> **Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.**

$$
\text{Quinn} = \text{Shaelyn} - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ laps/hour}
$$

---

### Step 5: How many more laps can Bethany run compared to Quinn?
$$
\text{Difference} = \text{Bethany} - \text{Quinn} = 10 - 5 = \boxed{5}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn in one hour.**
We are given that the **tank has a capacity of 18,000 gallons**, and we need to find out how many **gallons remain** for the tank to be full after Wanda and Ms. B pumped water over two days.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how much water was pumped on Day 1**

- **Wanda filled** $ \frac{1}{4} $ of the tank's capacity:
  $$
  \frac{1}{4} \times 18,000 = 4,500 \text{ gallons}
  $$

- **Ms. B pumped** $ \frac{3}{4} $ as much as Wanda:
  $$
  \frac{3}{4} \times 4,500 = 3,375 \text{ gallons}
  $$

- **Total pumped on Day 1**:
  $$
  4,500 + 3,375 = 7,875 \text{ gallons}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how much water was pumped on Day 2**

- **Wanda pumped** $ \frac{2}{3} $ of what she pumped on Day 1:
  $$
  \frac{2}{3} \times 4,500 = 3,000 \text{ gallons}
  $$

- **Ms. B pumped** $ \frac{1}{3} $ of what she pumped on Day 1:
  $$
  \frac{1}{3} \times 3,375 = 1,125 \text{ gallons}
  $$

- **Total pumped on Day 2**:
  $$
  3,000 + 1,125 = 4,125 \text{ gallons}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Total water pumped over both days**

$$
7,875 + 4,125 = 12,000 \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Water remaining in the tank to be full**

$$
18,000 - 12,000 = \boxed{6,000} \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{6,000} \text{ gallons}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out **what percentage of the power bank's total capacity was left when Maria went out to the park**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the charging behavior

- The power bank **loses 9% per hour** for the first **5 hours**.
- Then, it **loses 7% per hour** for the next **3 hours**.
- After these 8 hours, the **remaining charge is 28%** of the original capacity.

We are to find the **charge remaining when Maria left for the park**, which is before the 8 hours of discharging began.

---

### Step 2: Let’s define variables

Let:

- $ C $ = Total capacity of the power bank (in percentage).
- $ x $ = Percentage of charge remaining **when Maria left for the park** (this is what we want to find).

So, the power bank starts with $ x\% $ of its full capacity.

Then, over the next 8 hours, it loses charge at different rates:

- First 5 hours: loses **9% per hour**
- Next 3 hours: loses **7% per hour**

---

### Step 3: Model the loss of charge

We'll model the **remaining charge** after each period using exponential decay.

#### First 5 hours:
Each hour, the battery loses 9% of its current charge. That means it retains **91%** of its current charge each hour.

So after 5 hours:

$$
x \times (0.91)^5
$$

#### Next 3 hours:
Now, it loses 7% per hour, so it retains **93%** of its current charge each hour.

So after another 3 hours:

$$
x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3
$$

This final amount equals **28%** of the total capacity:

$$
x \times (0.91)^5 \times (0.93)^3 = 0.28
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for $ x $

First, compute the constants:

- $ (0.91)^5 \approx 0.6240 $
- $ (0.93)^3 \approx 0.8044 $

So:

$$
x \times 0.6240 \times 0.8044 = 0.28
$$

$$
x \times 0.5023 = 0.28
$$

$$
x = \frac{0.28}{0.5023} \approx 0.5575
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Maria left the park with approximately **55.75%** of the power bank's total charge.

So, the **charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was about 55.75%** of its total capacity.
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **1. Total Earnings per Hour:**

Janet earns:
- **$10/hour** from wages
- **$15/hour** from tips

So, her **total hourly earnings** =  
$$
10 + 15 = \$25 \text{ per hour}
$$

---

### **2. Weekly Earnings:**

She works **40 hours per week**, so her weekly earnings are:
$$
40 \times 25 = \$1000 \text{ per week}
$$

---

### **3. Down Payment Required:**

She wants to save **20% of the cost of a $10,000 car** for a down payment.

$$
20\% \text{ of } 10,000 = 0.20 \times 10,000 = \$2000
$$

---

### **4. Weeks Needed to Save $2000:**

She saves **\$1000 per week**, so to save **\$2000**, she needs:
$$
\frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ weeks}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Janet will need to work **2 weeks** to save up the down payment.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many plums Jamaar can buy with the remaining money after purchasing his other fruits.

---

### **Step 1: List of fruit prices (including tax):**
- **Peaches:** $0.50 each  
- **Pears:** $0.50 each  
- **Apples:** $0.75 each  
- **Kiwis:** $1.00 each  
- **Plums:** $0.25 each  

Jamaar has **$10** in total.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the cost of the fruits he already bought**

He bought:
- **3 peaches** at $0.50 each:  
  $ 3 \times 0.50 = 1.50 $
- **4 pears** at $0.50 each:  
  $ 4 \times 0.50 = 2.00 $
- **2 kiwis** at $1.00 each:  
  $ 2 \times 1.00 = 2.00 $
- **5 apples** at $0.75 each:  
  $ 5 \times 0.75 = 3.75 $

Now, add these up:

$$
1.50 + 2.00 + 2.00 + 3.75 = 9.25
$$

So, Jamaar has spent **$9.25** so far.

---

### **Step 3: Subtract from total money to find remaining amount**

$$
10.00 - 9.25 = 0.75
$$

Jamaar has **$0.75** left.

---

### **Step 4: How many plums can he buy with $0.75?**

Each plum costs **$0.25**, so:

$$
\frac{0.75}{0.25} = 3
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Jamaar can buy **3 plums** with the remaining money.
Let's break the problem down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Total number of packs**
Anne purchased a box that contains **15 packs**.

---

### **Step 2: Number of packs Anne kept**
She **kept 2 packs** for herself.

So, the number of packs she gave away is:

$$
15 - 2 = 13 \text{ packs}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Number of pieces per pack**
Each pack has **60 pieces**.

So, the total number of pieces given to her friends is:

$$
13 \text{ packs} \times 60 \text{ pieces/pack} = 780 \text{ pieces}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Number of friends**
She gave the sweets to **10 friends** equally.

To find how many pieces each friend received, divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends:

$$
\frac{780}{10} = 78 \text{ pieces}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Each of her friends received 78 pieces of sweets.**
We are given:

- Initial price of carrots = **$120**
- Annual increase = **5%** of the original price
- Time = **3 years**

This is a **compound growth problem**, where the price increases by 5% **each year** based on the **original price** (not the new price each year). This means the increase is **simple interest** rather than compound interest.

---

### Step-by-step calculation:

Let’s calculate the price after each year.

#### Year 1:
$$
\text{Increase} = 5\% \times 120 = 0.05 \times 120 = 6
$$
$$
\text{New price} = 120 + 6 = 126
$$

#### Year 2:
$$
\text{Increase} = 5\% \times 120 = 6
$$
$$
\text{New price} = 126 + 6 = 132
$$

#### Year 3:
$$
\text{Increase} = 5\% \times 120 = 6
$$
$$
\text{New price} = 132 + 6 = 138
$$

---

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{138}
$$

The price of carrots after three years would be **$138** (rounded to the nearest integer).
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of pictures
Olivia uploaded **72 pictures** to Facebook.

### Step 2: She put the same number of pictures into **8 albums**
So, she divided the 72 pictures equally among 8 albums.

$$
\text{Number of pictures per album} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
$$

So, each album has **9 pictures**.

### Step 3: Number of selfies and portraits
- **3 albums** were **selfies only**, so:
  $$
  3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies}
  $$

- **2 albums** were **portraits**, so:
  $$
  2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits}
  $$

### Step 4: Total number of portraits and selfies
$$
27 \text{ (selfies)} + 18 \text{ (portraits)} = 45
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**45 portraits and selfies in total.**
We are told:

- James reads **3 pages** in **10 minutes**.
- He reads a total of **18 pages**.

### Step 1: Find how long it takes to read 1 page
If 3 pages take 10 minutes, then:

$$
\text{Time per page} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes per page}
$$

### Step 2: Multiply by the number of pages he reads
He reads 18 pages, so:

$$
\text{Total time} = 18 \times \frac{10}{3} = \frac{180}{3} = 60 \text{ minutes}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{60} \text{ minutes}
$$
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Initial number of guests
The hotel was completely booked with **100 guests** in the morning.

---

### Step 2: Early checkout
- **24 guests** checked out early.
- So, the number of guests remaining after early checkout is:
  $$
  100 - 24 = 76
  $$

---

### Step 3: Late checkout
- **15 guests** opted for a late checkout.
- These guests are still staying, so they are still counted as part of the total.
- So, the number of guests remains:
  $$
  76 \text{ (from before)} + 15 = 91
  $$

---

### Step 4: Check-ins in the afternoon
- **Twice as many people checked in** as those who opted for a late checkout.
- Since 15 guests opted for a late checkout:
  $$
  2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ new guests checked in}
  $$
- Now, total guests:
  $$
  91 + 30 = 121
  $$

---

### Step 5: Check-ins after dinner
- **7 more people** checked in after dinner.
- Total guests now:
  $$
  121 + 7 = 128
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{128}
$$

So, the hotel now has **128 guests**.
Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Wednesday**: John picks **4 bananas**.
2. **Thursday**: John picks **6 bananas**.
3. **Friday**: He picks **triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday**.  
   - Since he picked 4 bananas on Wednesday, triple that is:  
     $ 3 \times 4 = 12 $ bananas.

Now, let's add them all together to find the total number of bananas John has:

$$
4 \text{ (Wednesday)} + 6 \text{ (Thursday)} + 12 \text{ (Friday)} = 22
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **22 bananas**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Total number of questions
- Total questions = **60**

### Step 2: Distribution of question types
- **Easy questions**: 40% of 60  
  $$
  0.40 \times 60 = 24 \text{ easy questions}
  $$

- The rest are **average** and **difficult**, equally divided:
  - Remaining questions = $60 - 24 = 36$
  - Average and difficult questions = 36 total, split equally:
    $$
    \frac{36}{2} = 18 \text{ average questions}, \quad 18 \text{ difficult questions}
    $$

### Step 3: Aries' performance
- She is sure to get **75% of the easy questions**:
  $$
  0.75 \times 24 = 18 \text{ correct easy questions}
  $$

- She gets **half of the average and difficult questions** correctly:
  - Total average and difficult questions = 18 + 18 = 36
  - Half of them = $0.5 \times 36 = 18$ correct answers

### Step 4: Total correct answers
$$
\text{Total correct} = 18 (\text{easy}) + 18 (\text{average and difficult}) = 36
$$

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{36} \text{ points}
$$

Aries is sure to get **36 points** on the quiz.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the variables

Let:
- $ x $ = number of **large** stuffed animals sold
- $ y $ = number of **small** stuffed animals sold

We are told:

- Teresa sells **large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones**
- She sold **twice as many small stuffed animals as large ones**, so:
  $$
  y = 2x
  $$
- Each **small** stuffed animal costs **$4**
- She earned a total of **$120** from sales

---

### Step 2: Find the price of a large stuffed animal

Since large stuffed animals cost **three times** the price of small ones, and each small one is **$4**, then:

$$
\text{Price of large} = 3 \times 4 = \$12
$$

---

### Step 3: Write the total earnings equation

She sold:
- $ x $ large stuffed animals at **$12 each**
- $ y = 2x $ small stuffed animals at **$4 each**

So her total earnings are:

$$
12x + 4y = 120
$$

Substitute $ y = 2x $ into the equation:

$$
12x + 4(2x) = 120
$$

$$
12x + 8x = 120
$$

$$
20x = 120
$$

$$
x = 6
$$

---

### Step 4: Find the number of small stuffed animals sold

Recall that:
$$
y = 2x = 2 \times 6 = 12
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{12}
$$

Teresa sold **12 small stuffed animals**.
Let's break this down step by step:

- The man eats **5** sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats **4** sandwiches per day.
- The son eats **2** sandwiches per day.

So, the total per day is:
$$
5 + 4 + 2 = 11 \text{ sandwiches per day}
$$

### Step 2: Multiply by the number of days in a week.
There are **7** days in a week.

$$
11 \times 7 = 77
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{77} \text{ sandwiches per week}
$$

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the money earned from cookies**
Suzanne sold **80 cookies** at **$1 each**:

$$
80 \text{ cookies} \times \$1 = \$80
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the money earned from cupcakes**
She sold **60 cupcakes** at **$4 each**:

$$
60 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$4 = \$240
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total earnings**
Add the money from cookies and cupcakes:

$$
\$80 + \$240 = \$320
$$

---

### **Step 4: Subtract the amount given to her sisters**
She gave **$10 each** to her **two sisters**, so:

$$
2 \times \$10 = \$20
$$

---

### **Step 5: Calculate the remaining money**
Subtract the amount given to her sisters from her total earnings:

$$
\$320 - \$20 = \$300
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$300}

Suzanne has **\$300** left from her earnings.
Let's break the problem down step by step:

1. **Total number of eggs hidden:**  
   $ 100 $

2. **Eggs found by the Smith twins:**  
   Each twin found 30 eggs, so together they found:  
   $ 30 + 30 = 60 $ eggs.

3. **Remaining eggs after the twins found theirs:**  
   $ 100 - 60 = 40 $ eggs left.

4. **We are told that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends.**  
   That means:  
   $ 40 - 10 = 30 $ eggs were found by the friends.

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The friends found 30 eggs.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Determine how much ore one dwarf can mine per day with a steel pickaxe.**

- A dwarf can mine **12 pounds of ore per day** with his **bare hands**.
- With an **iron pickaxe**, he can mine **twice as much**:
  $$
  12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds/day}
  $$
- With a **steel pickaxe**, he can mine **50% more** than with an iron pickaxe:
  $$
  24 + (24 \times 0.5) = 24 + 12 = 36 \text{ pounds/day}
  $$

So, **one dwarf with a steel pickaxe mines 36 pounds of ore per day**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the total for 40 dwarves in one day.**

$$
40 \text{ dwarves} \times 36 \text{ pounds/day} = 1440 \text{ pounds/day}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Multiply by the number of days in a month (30 days).**

$$
1440 \text{ pounds/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 43,200 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{43,200} \text{ pounds of ore}
$$
We are told that the store offers sandwiches in three different package sizes, and the prices are **proportional**. That means the price per sandwich is the same across all packages.

Let’s analyze the information given:

---

### Step 1: Understand the known package prices

- **Package A:** 2 sandwiches for $3  
- **Package B:** 4 sandwiches for $6  
- **Package C:** 8 sandwiches (price unknown)

We are told the prices are **proportional**, which means the **cost per sandwich is the same** for all packages.

---

### Step 2: Find the cost per sandwich

Let’s compute the cost per sandwich for the first two packages.

#### Package A:
$$
\text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{\$3}{2} = \$1.50 \text{ per sandwich}
$$

#### Package B:
$$
\text{Cost per sandwich} = \frac{\$6}{4} = \$1.50 \text{ per sandwich}
$$

So the cost per sandwich is consistent — **\$1.50 per sandwich**.

---

### Step 3: Use the rate to find the price of the third package

Now we know that each sandwich costs **\$1.50**, so for **8 sandwiches**:

$$
\text{Total cost} = 8 \times \$1.50 = \$12
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$12}
$$

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost **\$12**.
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the total cost of the new bedroom set**
Tom buys a **new bedroom set for $3000**.

---

### **Step 2: He sells his old bedroom set for $1000**
He uses that **$1000 to pay toward the new bedroom set**.

So, the remaining amount he needs to pay is:

$$
\$3000 - \$1000 = \$2000
$$

---

### **Step 3: He has to pay 10% per month on the remaining balance**

He now owes **$2000**, and he has to pay **10% of that amount each month**.

So, the monthly payment is:

$$
10\% \text{ of } \$2000 = 0.10 \times 2000 = \$200
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: Tom has to pay $200 per month.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many balloons Sally finally carried into the school.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Balloons**

Sally was holding:

- **25 red balloons**
- **7 green balloons**
- **12 yellow balloons**

So, total initial balloons =  
$$
25 + 7 + 12 = 44 \text{ balloons}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Red Balloons Burst**

A gust of wind caused **40% of the red balloons to burst**.  
So, number of red balloons that burst:
$$
40\% \times 25 = 0.4 \times 25 = 10 \text{ balloons}
$$

Remaining red balloons:
$$
25 - 10 = 15 \text{ red balloons}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Yellow Balloons Released**

She accidentally released **half of the yellow balloons**.  
Half of 12 is:
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons}
$$

Remaining yellow balloons:
$$
12 - 6 = 6 \text{ yellow balloons}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Blue Balloons Added**

She found **8 blue balloons caught in a tree**, and she added **75% of them** to her remaining clutch.

So, number of blue balloons added:
$$
75\% \times 8 = 0.75 \times 8 = 6 \text{ blue balloons}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Total Balloons Carried into School**

Now we add up all the remaining balloons:

- Remaining red: **15**
- Green: **7** (none were lost)
- Remaining yellow: **6**
- Added blue: **6**

Total balloons carried into the school:
$$
15 + 7 + 6 + 6 = \boxed{34}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{34}
$$ balloons.
Let's break this down step by step to find the **percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the possible scenarios

Marcus has a few possibilities:

- **Substitute teacher (50% chance):**
  - The substitute **won't collect** the homework.
  - So, if this happens, Marcus **doesn't need to turn it in**.

- **Normal teacher (50% chance):**
  - She might give an **extension to everyone** (40% chance).
    - If she does, Marcus doesn’t need to turn it in.
  - If she **doesn’t give an extension** (60% chance), then:
    - Marcus might still be able to convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment (20% chance).
      - If he can, he gets a **personal extension**, so he doesn't need to turn it in.
      - If not (80% chance), he **has to turn in his homework**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of **not** turning in homework

We want to find the **probability that Marcus will NOT have to turn in his homework**. Then we'll subtract that from 100% to get the probability that **he will have to turn it in**.

#### Case 1: Substitute teacher (50% chance)
- Probability = 50%
- Marcus **does not** have to turn in homework.

#### Case 2: Normal teacher (50% chance)
- She gives an extension to everyone (40% of 50%):
  - Probability = 0.5 × 0.4 = 20%
  - Marcus **does not** have to turn in homework.

- She does **not** give an extension (60% of 50%):
  - Probability = 0.5 × 0.6 = 30%
  - Now, Marcus tries to convince the teacher (20% chance):
    - He gets a personal extension (20% of 30%):
      - Probability = 0.3 × 0.2 = 6%
      - Marcus **does not** have to turn in homework.
    - He **does not** get a personal extension (80% of 30%):
      - Probability = 0.3 × 0.8 = 24%
      - Marcus **has to** turn in homework.

So total probability Marcus **does not** have to turn in homework under normal teacher:
- 20% (extension for everyone) + 6% (personal extension) = **26%**

Now add the two cases:

- Substitute teacher: 50%
- Normal teacher: 26%

Total probability **Marcus does not have to turn in homework** =  
**50% + 26% = 76%**

---

Let's solve this step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Total Capacity of the Fine Arts Center**
The Fine Arts Center has space for **6000 people**.

---

### **Step 2: Subtract Seats Already Reserved**
We are told that:
- **950 seats** are reserved for graduates.
- **300 seats** are reserved for faculty.

So, total reserved seats =  
$$
950 + 300 = 1250
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate Remaining Seats for Friends and Family**
Remaining seats = Total capacity - Reserved seats  
$$
6000 - 1250 = 4750
$$

---

### **Step 4: Determine How Many Tickets Each Graduate Gets**
There are **950 graduates**, and these **4750 remaining seats** are to be **split equally among them**.

So, tickets per graduate =  
$$
\frac{4750}{950} = 5
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Each graduate would receive **5 tickets** to give to their friends and family.
We are given the following information:

1. **It takes 75 large jelly beans to fill Grandpa up.**
2. **He can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans.**
3. **Eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean.**

We need to find: **How many small beans can Grandpa eat?**

---

### Step 1: Determine how many medium beans Grandpa can eat

From (2):  
> He can eat **twice as many medium-sized beans** as large beans.

Since it takes **75 large beans** to fill him up, then he can eat:

$$
\text{Medium beans} = 2 \times 75 = 150
$$

---

### Step 2: Convert medium beans to small beans

From (3):  
> Eating **3 small beans** is the same as eating **1 medium bean**.

So, each **medium bean** is equivalent to **3 small beans**.

Therefore, the number of **small beans** equivalent to 150 medium beans is:

$$
\text{Small beans} = 150 \times 3 = 450
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{450}
$$

Grandpa can eat **450 small beans**.
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much **Melissa makes per hour after expenses**.

---

### Step 1: Total time spent on jury duty

She spends **6 hours a day** for **3 days**:

$$
6 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 18 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 2: Total pay received

She is paid **$15 per day**, for **3 days**:

$$
15 \text{ dollars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 45 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Net earnings after expenses

$$
\text{Net earnings} = \text{Total pay} - \text{Total expenses} = 45 - 9 = 36 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 5: Earnings per hour

Now divide the net earnings by the total number of hours worked:

$$
\frac{36 \text{ dollars}}{18 \text{ hours}} = 2 \text{ dollars/hour}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Melissa makes $2 per hour after expenses.**
Let's break it down step by step:

### **Step 1: Determine the number of soda bottles needed**

Richard wants to place a bottle of soda every **3 feet** along a **24-foot wide** driveway.

$$
\text{Number of bottles} = \frac{\text{Total width}}{\text{Distance between bottles}} = \frac{24}{3} = 8
$$

So, Richard will need **8 bottles**.

---

### **Step 2: Determine the number of moves between bottles**

Richard starts at the **first bottle**, and then goes from one bottle to the next. So, the number of moves is:

$$
\text{Number of moves} = \text{Number of bottles} - 1 = 8 - 1 = 7
$$

He makes **7 moves** to go from the first bottle to the last one.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total time required**

Each move takes **5 seconds**.

$$
\text{Total time} = \text{Number of moves} \times \text{Time per move} = 7 \times 5 = 35 \text{ seconds}

$$
\text{Cost of Parmesan} = 2 \times 11 = 22 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the cost of Mozzarella cheese**
- Price per pound of Mozzarella = $6
- Amor buys 3 pounds  
$$
\text{Cost of Mozzarella} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total cost of cheese**
$$
\text{Total cost} = 22 + 18 = 40 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Subtract total cost from initial amount**
Amor starts with $50.  
$$
\text{Money left} = 50 - 40 = 10 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Let's break this down step by step to figure out **how long it would take Jim to earn back the money equivalent to his loans and the money he lost from not working while in school**.

---

### **1. Total Loans Taken:**

Jim takes out **$50,000 in loans per year** for **4 years**:

$$
\text{Total loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = \$200,000
$$

---

### **2. Income Before College:**

Before college, Jim earned **$25,000 per year**.

So, over **4 years of college**, he **lost that income**:

$$
\text{Income lost} = 25,000 \times 4 = \$100,000
$$

---

### **3. Income After College:**

After earning his degree, his income **tripled**.

$$
\text{New income} = 25,000 \times 3 = \$75,000 \text{ per year}
$$

---

### **4. Net Gain in Income Per Year After College:**

Now we calculate how much more money Jim earns **after** college compared to before:

$$
\text{Net gain per year} = 75,000 - 25,000 = \$50,000 \text{ per year}
$$

---

### **5. Total Amount to Repay:**

Jim has to repay **$200,000 in loans** and also make up for the **$100,000 in lost income** during college.

So total amount to "earn back" is:

$$
\text{Total to earn back} = 200,000 + 100,000 = \$300,000
$$

---

### **6. Time to Earn Back the $300,000:**

He now earns **$50,000 more per year** than before (from the net gain), so the time needed to earn back the total amount is:

$$
\text{Time to earn back} = \frac{300,000}{50,000} = 6 \text{ years}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

It would take Jim **6 years** to earn back the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the size of the bed
The bed measures:
- **Length**: 6 feet  
- **Width**: 8 feet  

### Step 2: Determine the size of each piece of fabric Jim needs
Jim wants **two pieces** of fabric that are **2 feet longer and 2 feet wider** than the bed.

So, for each piece of fabric:
- **Length**: 6 feet + 2 feet = **8 feet**
- **Width**: 8 feet + 2 feet = **10 feet**

### Step 3: Calculate the area of one piece of fabric
$$
\text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 8 \text{ ft} \times 10 \text{ ft} = 80 \text{ square feet}
$$

### Step 4: Calculate the total area for two pieces
$$
\text{Total Area} = 80 \text{ sq ft} \times 2 = \boxed{160} \text{ square feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Monday:**
The post office delivered **425 letters**.

---

### **Tuesday:**
They delivered **17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday**.

First, find one-fifth of Monday's delivery:
$$
\frac{1}{5} \times 425 = 85
$$

Then add 17:
$$
85 + 17 = 102
$$

So, on **Tuesday**, they delivered **102 letters**.

---

### **Wednesday:**
They delivered **5 more than twice as many as Tuesday**.

First, find twice Tuesday’s delivery:
$$
2 \times 102 = 204
$$

Then add 5:
$$
204 + 5 = 209
$$

So, on **Wednesday**, they delivered **209 letters**.

---

### **Total for Monday to Wednesday:**

Add up the deliveries:

$$
425 \ (\text{Monday}) + 102 \ (\text{Tuesday}) + 209 \ (\text{Wednesday}) = 736
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{736}
$$ letters were delivered from Monday to Wednesday.
Let's break this down step by step to find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the cost for the chicken salad
- Number of people who want chicken salad = **10**
- Cost per person for chicken salad = **$6.50**

$$
\text{Cost for chicken salad} = 10 \times 6.50 = 65.00
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the cost for the pasta salad
- Number of people who want pasta salad = **6**
- Cost per person for pasta salad = **$6**

$$
\text{Cost for pasta salad} = 6 \times 6 = 36.00
$$

---

### Step 3: Add both amounts to get the total cost

$$
\text{Total cost} = 65.00 + 36.00 = 101.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Molly will pay $101.00 for the catering.**
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much Johnny's dad lost **on average** that day.

---

### Step 1: First race
- **Lost**: $5

---

### Step 2: Second race
- He **won** an amount that is **$1 more than twice** the amount he previously lost.
- Previously lost = $5
- So, he won:
  $$
  2 \times 5 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11
  $$

So, he **gained $11** in the second race.

---

### Step 3: Third race
- He **lost** an amount that is **1.5 times** as much as he won in the second race.
- He won $11 in the second race
- So, he lost:
  $$
  1.5 \times 11 = 16.5
  $$

So, he **lost $16.50** in the third race.

---

### Step 4: Total loss for the day
Now let's add up all the losses and gains:

- Lost in first race: **$5**
- Gained in second race: **+$11**
- Lost in third race: **$16.50**

So total net change:
$$
5 - 11 + 16.50 = (5 + 16.50) - 11 = 21.50 - 11 = 10.50
$$

So, **Johnny's dad had a net gain of $10.50** that day.

---

### Step 5: Average loss per race
There were **3 races**, so we calculate the **average loss per race**.

But wait — since there was a **net gain**, not all races resulted in a loss. So if we're asked about the **average loss**, we need to consider only the **losses**.

Losses occurred in:
- First race: $5
- Third race: $16.50

Total loss:  
$$
5 + 16.50 = 21.50
$$

Average loss per race (only considering races with losses):
$$
\frac{21.50}{2} = 10.75
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Johnny's dad lost an average of $10.75 per race** on days when he actually lost money.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of countries in South America**: 26  
2. **Number of cities per country**: 5  
3. **Population per city**: 1,000 people  

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of cities in South America  
$$
\text{Total cities} = \text{Number of countries} \times \text{Cities per country} = 26 \times 5 = 130
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total population  
$$
\text{Total population} = \text{Total cities} \times \text{Population per city} = 130 \times 1000 = 130,000
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:  
$$
\boxed{130,000}
$$

There are **130,000 people** living in South America according to this scenario.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Convert Xavier’s height to inches**

Xavier was originally **4 feet tall**.  
Since 1 foot = 12 inches, we can convert:

$$
4 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ inches}
$$

He grew **3 inches**, so his new height is:

$$
48 + 3 = 51 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Cole’s height**

Cole was already **50 inches tall** and grew **2 inches**, so his new height is:

$$
50 + 2 = 52 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the difference between Cole and Xavier’s heights**

Now, subtract Xavier’s height from Cole’s height:

$$
52 - 51 = 1 \text{ inch}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now is 1 inch.**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let the amount taken by the **first person** be:

$$
x
$$

Then, the **second person** took:

$$
x + 80
$$

And the **third person** took **twice** what the second person took:

$$
2(x + 80)
$$

---

### Step 2: Write the total amount equation

The total amount divided is $1920. So:

$$
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
$$

Simplify the left-hand side:

$$
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
$$

Combine like terms:

$$
4x + 240 = 1920
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

Subtract 240 from both sides:

$$
4x = 1920 - 240 = 1680
$$

Divide both sides by 4:

$$
x = \frac{1680}{4} = 420
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

The share of the **first person** is:

$$
\boxed{420}
$$
We are given:

- A team of **4 painters**
- They worked for **3/8 of a day every day** for **3 weeks**
- We need to find how many **hours of work each painter put in**

---

### Step 1: Convert the time period into days

There are **7 days in a week**, so:

$$
3 \text{ weeks} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \text{ days}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find total number of workdays

Each day, they worked **3/8 of a day**.

So total work time is:

$$
21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ day/day} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ days}
$$

---

### Step 3: Convert days to hours

There are **24 hours in a day**, so:

$$
\frac{63}{8} \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = \frac{63 \times 24}{8} \text{ hours}
$$

Now compute that:

$$
\frac{63 \times 24}{8} = \frac{1512}{8} = 189 \text{ hours (total)}
$$

---

### Step 4: Divide by the number of painters

There are **4 painters**, so each painter worked:

$$
\frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{47.25} \text{ hours}
$$

So, **each painter put in 47.25 hours of work**.
We are told that Rory retrieved tennis balls in **three sets**, and we need to find how many he retrieved in the **first set**.

Let’s define variables:

Let:
- $ x $ = number of balls retrieved in the **second set**

From the problem:

1. In the **first set**, he retrieved **4 more balls** than in the second set → $ x + 4 $
2. In the **third set**, he retrieved **half as many** as in the second set → $ \frac{x}{2} $
3. The **total** number of balls retrieved is **19**.

Now, write the equation for the total:

$$
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
$$

### Step 1: Combine like terms

First, combine the $ x $ terms:

$$
x + x + \frac{x}{2} = 2x + \frac{x}{2}
$$

Now convert all terms to have a common denominator (denominator of 2):

$$
2x = \frac{4x}{2}, \quad \text{so } 2x + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{4x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{5x}{2}
$$

So the equation becomes:

$$
\frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
$$

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

Subtract 4 from both sides:

$$
\frac{5x}{2} = 15
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
5x = 30
$$

Divide by 5:

$$
x = 6
$$

### Step 3: Find the number of balls in the first set

Recall that the first set had $ x + 4 $ balls:

$$
x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Rory retrieved 10 tennis balls in the first set.**
We are given:

- **Initial price of the car (in 2007):** $20,000  
- **Depreciation rate per year:** 21%  
- **Time period:** From 2007 to 2010 → **3 years**

---

### Step 1: Understand the depreciation formula

Since the car depreciates at a constant rate each year, we use the **exponential decay** formula:

$$
P(t) = P_0 \times (1 - r)^t
$$

Where:
- $ P(t) $ = price after $ t $ years
- $ P_0 $ = initial price
- $ r $ = annual depreciation rate (as a decimal)
- $ t $ = number of years

---

### Step 2: Plug in the values

- $ P_0 = 20000 $
- $ r = 0.21 $
- $ t = 3 $

$$
P(3) = 20000 \times (1 - 0.21)^3
$$
$$
P(3) = 20000 \times (0.79)^3
$$

Now calculate $ (0.79)^3 $:

$$
(0.79)^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.493039
$$

So:

$$
P(3) = 20000 \times 0.493039 = 9860.78
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\$9860.78}
$$

The price of the car in the year **2010** is **\$9860.78**.
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Total number of books**: 50

2. **Books written in English**:
   - Half of the books are in English.
   - So, $ \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 $ books.

3. **Books written in German**:
   - 10% of the books are in German.
   - So, $ 10\% \times 50 = 0.10 \times 50 = 5 $ books.

4. **Books written in Spanish**:
   - The rest of the books are in Spanish.
   - So, subtract the English and German books from the total:
     $$
     50 - 25 - 5 = 20
     $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **20 Spanish books**.
Let's solve this step by step.

1955 \text{ kilometers}
$$

### Step 2: Distance Bernice has already driven
She drove:
$$
325 \text{ kilometers per day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 1300 \text{ kilometers}
$$

### Step 3: Subtract the distance she has already driven from the total
$$
1955 - 1300 = 655 \text{ kilometers}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Bernice will still need to drive **655 kilometers**.
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Determine how many cups Ingrid drinks in 30 days:**

   Ingrid drinks **8 cups per day**.

   So, in 30 days:
   $$
   8 \text{ cups/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ cups}
   $$

2. **Convert cups to gallons:**

   We are told that **16 cups = 1 gallon**.

   So, to find out how many gallons are in 240 cups:
   $$
   \frac{240 \text{ cups}}{16 \text{ cups/gallon}} = 15 \text{ gallons}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Ingrid drinks **15 gallons** of water in 30 days.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Initial Setup:**

- **Romeo boards a train with 120 people.**  
  So, initially, there are **120 people on the train**.

---

### **First Stop:**

- **20 more people board the train.**  
  So, number of people now =  
  $$
  120 + 20 = 140
  $$

---

### **Second Stop:**

- **50 people descend (get off).**
- **Twice that number (i.e., 100 people) board the train.**

So, net change at second stop:
$$
-50 + 100 = +50
$$

Number of people now =  
$$
140 + 50 = 190
$$

---

### **Third Stop:**

- **80 people descend (get off).**

So, number of people now =  
$$
190 - 80 = 110
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{110}
$$

There are **110 people on the train at the final stop**.
Let's break down the cost of each item Alison bought step by step:

---

### 1. **Tank top**
- Cost: **$10**

  - $8 − $2 = **$6**

---

### Now, let’s add up all the costs:

- Tank top: $10  
- Running shorts: $15  
- Tennis shoes: $24  
- Socks: $6  

**Total = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $55**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$55**
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Determine the number of tiles needed:**
- Each tile is **1 foot by 1 foot**, so each tile covers **1 square foot**.
- The total area of the kitchen floor is **200 square feet**.
- Therefore, you will need:
  
  $$
  \frac{200 \text{ sq ft}}{1 \text{ sq ft per tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles}
  $$

### 2. **Calculate the total cost:**
- Each tile costs **$12**.
- So, the total cost is:

  $$
  200 \text{ tiles} \times \$12 \text{ per tile} = \$2400
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The total cost to renovate your kitchen floor is $2400.**

\$120 \text{ per month}
$$

### 2. **Insurance cost after the accident:**
It increased by **60%**.

So, we calculate the increase:
$$
60\% \text{ of } \$120 = 0.60 \times 120 = \$72
$$

Now add that to the original cost:
$$
\$120 + \$72 = \$192 \text{ per month}
$$

### 3. **Annual cost (for one year):**
There are 12 months in a year, so:
$$
\$192 \times 12 = \$2,304
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$2,304} \text{ per year}

### **Step 1: Determine how many sheets he needs to wash per week**

- He has **4 twin beds** and **1 king bed**.
- So, he needs to wash:
  - **4 twin sets** of sheets
  - **1 king set** of sheets

---

### **Step 2: Understand the capacity of his laundry machine**

- The machine can handle:
  - **2 twin sets at a time**
  - **1 king set at a time**

So, for each load:

- He can wash **2 twin sets** and **1 king set** together (since they are separate categories).

---

### **Step 3: How many loads per week?**

He needs to wash:
- 4 twin sets → divide by 2 = **2 loads** of twins
- 1 king set → **1 load** of king

So total loads per week = **2 + 1 = 3 loads**

---

### **Step 4: Calculate total loads per year**

There are **52 weeks** in a year.

So total number of laundry loads per year =  
**3 loads/week × 52 weeks/year = 156 loads**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Greg does 156 loads of laundry in a year.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Movies watched on Saturday
Jill and her friends watch **4 movies every Saturday**.

### Step 2: Movies watched on Sunday
They watch **half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday**.

So, on Sunday:
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \text{ movies}
$$

### Step 3: Total movies per weekend
Each weekend (Saturday + Sunday) they watch:
$$
4 \text{ (Saturday)} + 2 \text{ (Sunday)} = 6 \text{ movies}
$$

### Step 4: Total movies in 4 weeks
If they watch movies every weekend for **4 weeks**, then:
$$
6 \text{ movies/weekend} \times 4 \text{ weekends} = 24 \text{ movies}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{24}
$$ movies in 4 weeks.
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### 1. **Two years ago**, Leo had **100 stickers**.

So, that’s our starting point.

---

### 2. **Last year**, Leo collected **50 stickers**.

That means, **one year ago**, he had:

$$
100 + 50 = 150 \text{ stickers}
$$

---

### 3. **This year**, Leo collected **twice the number of stickers as last year**.

Last year he collected **50 stickers**, so this year he collected:

$$
2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ stickers}
$$

---

### 4. Now, to find out how many stickers **Leo has in his collection now**, we add the stickers he collected this year to what he had one year ago (which was 150):

$$
150 + 100 = \boxed{250} \text{ stickers}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **250 stickers**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of cats:** 3  
2. **Amount of food per feeding per cat:** 60 grams  
3. **Number of feedings per day:** 2  

### Step 1: Calculate total food used per day
Each cat eats 60 grams per feeding, and there are 2 feedings per day.

So, for **one cat**, the daily food consumption is:
$$
60 \text{ grams/feeding} \times 2 \text{ feedings/day} = 120 \text{ grams/day}
$$

Now for **3 cats**:
$$
120 \text{ grams/day/cat} \times 3 \text{ cats} = 360 \text{ grams/day}
$$

### Step 2: How many days will 720 grams last?
$$
\frac{720 \text{ grams}}{360 \text{ grams/day}} = 2 \text{ days}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**720 grams of cat food will last 2 days.**
We are given the following information:

- There are **4 pizzas**, and each pizza has **8 slices**, so:
  $$
  \text{Total slices} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ slices}
  $$

- Becky ate **10 slices**.
- Becky ate **3 more slices than Jake**.
- Silvia ate **twice as many slices as Jake**.

Let’s define variables:

Let $ J $ be the number of slices Jake ate.

From the problem:

- Becky ate: $ J + 3 = 10 $
- Silvia ate: $ 2J $

### Step 1: Solve for $ J $

$$
J + 3 = 10 \\
J = 10 - 3 = 7
$$

So, **Jake ate 7 slices**.

### Step 2: Find how many slices Silvia ate

$$
\text{Silvia} = 2J = 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ slices}
$$

### Step 3: Add up all slices eaten

$$
\text{Becky} = 10 \\
\text{Jake} = 7 \\
\text{Silvia} = 14 \\
\text{Total slices eaten} = 10 + 7 + 14 = 31
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{31}
$$

So, **they ate a total of 31 slices**.
We are given:

- Betsy's part took **18 minutes longer** than Donovan's part.
- The **total time** taken to make the meal was **98 minutes**.

Let’s define variables:

Let $ D $ be the time (in minutes) it took **Donovan** to complete his part.  
Then, Betsy's part took $ D + 18 $ minutes.

The total time is the sum of both parts:

$$
D + (D + 18) = 98
$$

Simplify the equation:

$$
2D + 18 = 98
$$

Subtract 18 from both sides:

$$
2D = 80
$$

Divide by 2:

$$
D = 40
$$

So, Donovan's part took **40 minutes**, and Betsy's part took:

$$
D + 18 = 40 + 18 = \boxed{58}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **58 minutes**.
Let's break down the costs step by step to find the **total cost of the doctor's visit**:

---

### 1. **Cost of the cast**:  
$$
\$200
$$

---

### 2. **Cost of the visit**:  
- The doctor charges **\$300/hour** for a **30-minute visit**.  
- A 30-minute visit is **0.5 hours**.

$$
\$300 \times 0.5 = \$150
$$

---

### 3. **Cost of painkillers**:  
- She takes **30 pills**, each costing **\$4**.

$$
30 \times \$4 = \$120
$$

---

### 4. **Cost of parking**:  
- Parking costs **\$6/hour**, and there's a **minimum of 2 hours** required.

$$
\$6 \times 2 = \$12
$$

---

### ✅ Now, add all the costs together:

$$
\$200 \ (\text{cast}) + \$150 \ (\text{visit}) + \$120 \ (\text{painkillers}) + \$12 \ (\text{parking}) = \$482
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$482}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total emails per day**:  
   James gets **80 emails** each day.

2. **Percentage of emails that don't require a response**:  
   **20%** of the emails don’t need a response.

3. **Calculate the number of non-response emails per day**:  
   $$
   20\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.20 \times 80 = 16
   $$

4. **Number of emails that require a response per day**:  
   $$
   80 - 16 = 64
   $$

5. **Number of days in a work week**:  
   A 5-day work week means James responds to emails for **5 days**.

6. **Total number of emails he responds to in a week**:  
   $$
   64 \text{ emails/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 320
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **320 emails**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

We are told that the Science Center hosted field trips from **Monday through Friday** last week, and we need to find the **total number of classes** that visited during the week.

---

### Step 1: Monday
- **32 classes** visited on **Monday**

$$
\text{Monday} = 32
$$

---

### Step 2: Tuesday
- Twice as many classes visited on **Tuesday** as on **Monday**
- So:

$$
\text{Tuesday} = 2 \times 32 = 64
$$

---

### Step 3: Wednesday
- Three times as many classes visited on **Wednesday** as on **Monday**
- So:

$$
\text{Wednesday} = 3 \times 32 = 96
$$

---

### Step 4: Thursday
- **30 classes** visited on **Thursday**

$$
\text{Thursday} = 30
$$

---

### Step 5: Friday
- **25 classes** visited on **Friday**

$$
\text{Friday} = 25
$$

---

### Step 6: Total number of classes
Now add up all the classes from Monday to Friday:

$$
\text{Total} = 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
$$

Let’s do the addition step by step:

- $32 + 64 = 96$
- $96 + 96 = 192$
- $192 + 30 = 222$
- $222 + 25 = 247$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{247}
$$

**In all, 247 classes visited the Science Center last week.**
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Find the total of all test scores
John scored:
- 100 on the first test  
- 100 on the second test  
- 100 on the third test  
- 80 on the fourth test  

So, the total score is:  
$$
100 + 100 + 100 + 80 = 380
$$

### Step 2: Divide by the number of tests to find the average
There are 4 tests, so the average is:  
$$
\frac{380}{4} = 95
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **95**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many pizzas the glee club ordered and ate**

- The glee club ordered **20 pizzas**.
- They ate **70%** of them.

$$
\text{Pizzas eaten by glee club} = 20 \times 0.70 = 14
$$

So, **14 pizzas** were eaten by the glee club.

$$
\text{Pizzas left from glee club} = 20 - 14 = 6
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many pizzas the football team ordered and ate**

- The football team ordered **twice as many** as the glee club.
- Glee club ordered 20 pizzas → Football team ordered:

$$
20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ pizzas}
$$

- They ate **80%** of those:

$$
\text{Pizzas eaten by football team} = 40 \times 0.80 = 32
$$

$$
\text{Pizzas left from football team} = 40 - 32 = 8
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add up the leftover pizzas**

$$
\text{Total pizzas left} = 6 \text{ (from glee club)} + 8 \text{ (from football team)} = 14
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{14} \text{ pizzas are left.}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine the number of each type of coupon

- **Small coupons:** 700
- **Big coupons:** Twice as many as small coupons  
  $$
  2 \times 700 = 1400
  $$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the postage cost for each type

- **Cost per small coupon:** 5 cents  
  $$
  700 \times 5 = 3500 \text{ cents}
  $$

- **Cost per big coupon:** 15 cents  
  $$
  1400 \times 15 = 21000 \text{ cents}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Add the costs together

$$
3500 + 21000 = 24500 \text{ cents}
$$

---

### Step 4: Convert to dollars (optional)

$$
24500 \text{ cents} = \frac{24500}{100} = 245 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{245} \text{ dollars}
$$
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney originally ordered.**

> "Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches."

So:

$$
\text{Original order} = 10 - 3 = 7 \text{ sub sandwiches}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs.**

So total number of meatballs in the original order is:

$$
7 \times 4 = 28 \text{ meatballs}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.**

So now, the number of remaining sub sandwiches is:

$$
7 - 4 = 3 \text{ sub sandwiches left}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches.**

Now the total number of sub sandwiches is:

$$
3 + 3 = 6 \text{ sub sandwiches}
$$

---

### **Step 5: How many meatballs are in the sub sandwiches that remained?**

Each sub sandwich has 4 meatballs, so:

$$
6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ meatballs}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{24} \text{ meatballs}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Total number of trucks dispatched
Mr Hezekiah had **20 trucks** dispatched for delivery.

### Step 2: Number of trucks with mechanical failures
A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures.  
So,  
$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ trucks}
$$

### Step 3: Number of trucks that actually delivered
$$
20 - 5 = 15 \text{ trucks}
$$

### Step 4: Amount of fertiliser per truck
Each truck was carrying **20 tons** of fertiliser.

### Step 5: Total amount of fertiliser delivered
$$
15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{300} \text{ tons}
$$

So, **300 tons of fertiliser** reached the farmers that day.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand how much butter Dennis needs
Dennis uses **1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants**.  
He needs to make **6 dozen croissants**.

So, he needs:
$$
6 \text{ dozen} \times 1 \text{ pound per dozen} = 6 \text{ pounds of butter}
$$

---

### Step 2: Understand the promotion
The store has a **buy one pound, get one half off** promotion.  
This means if you buy **1 pound**, you pay **full price** for that pound and **half price** for the second pound (i.e., the second pound is free or at half price).

But wait — let’s clarify the promotion:

- "Buy one pound, get one half off" usually means:
  - For **every 1 pound you buy**, you get **another half pound** for free or at half price.
  - So it's not a 50% discount on the second pound, but rather **a 50% discount on an additional pound** for every pound you buy.

However, since we are buying **6 pounds**, and the promotion is **buy one, get one half off**, we can interpret this as:

- For every **1 pound you buy**, you get **an additional 0.5 pounds at half price**.

So, for **6 pounds**, how many free or discounted pounds do you get?

Let’s calculate based on the interpretation that it's **for every pound you buy, you get 0.5 pounds at half price**.

That means:

- For **each full pound** you buy, you get **0.5 pounds at half price**.

So for **6 pounds**, you get:
$$
6 \times 0.5 = 3 \text{ pounds at half price}
$$

Now, total cost = cost of full-price pounds + cost of discounted pounds

- Full-price pounds = 6 pounds
- Discounted pounds = 3 pounds at half price

---

### Step 3: Calculate the cost

- Cost of 1 pound of butter = $4.00
- Cost of 3 pounds at half price = $4.00 × 3 × 0.5 = $6.00

So total cost:
$$
6 \times 4.00 + 3 \times 4.00 \times 0.5 = 24.00 + 6.00 = \boxed{\$30.00}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$30.00}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find the total cost of Kayla's birthday party.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many people are coming to the party**

Kayla invited:
- 25 classmates  
- 7 girls in her dance class  
- 13 family members  

So, total number of people invited:

$$
25 + 7 + 13 = 45 \text{ people}
$$

But **4 people said they couldn't come**, so the actual number of guests attending is:

$$
45 - 4 = 41 \text{ guests}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Understand the cost structure**

The cost includes:
- A **fixed fee** of **$125** for a party of **20**
- An **additional $6 per guest** beyond the first 20

So we need to calculate:
- The fixed cost for the first 20 guests: **$125**
- The additional cost for the remaining guests (41 - 20 = 21 guests):  
  $$
  21 \times 6 = 126
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Add the costs together**

$$
\text{Total cost} = 125 + 126 = \boxed{251}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: The party will cost $251.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the initial amounts
- Maggie had **$60**.
- Riza also had **$60**.

### Step 2: Calculate how much each spent
- **Maggie spent a quarter of her money**:
  $$
  \frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15
  $$
  So, Maggie spent **$15**.

- **Riza spent one-third of her money**:
  $$
  \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
  $$
  So, Riza spent **$20**.

### Step 3: Calculate how much each has left
- Maggie has:
  $$
  60 - 15 = 45
  $$

- Riza has:
  $$
  60 - 20 = 40
  $$

### Step 4: Add their remaining money together
$$
45 + 40 = 85
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**They have $85 left altogether.**
We are told that Mr. Robles buys **315 bananas**, which is enough to feed his **three monkeys for a week**.

So, the total number of bananas used in **one week (7 days)** is **315**.

---

### Step 1: Find how many bananas are eaten per day

$$
\text{Bananas per day} = \frac{315}{7} = 45
$$

So, the three monkeys eat **45 bananas per day** together.

---

### Step 2: Let’s define the banana consumption of each monkey

Let’s denote:

- First monkey eats: $ x $
- Second monkey eats: $ x + 4 $ (since it eats 4 more than the first)
- Third monkey eats: the rest of the bananas for the day

So the total bananas eaten per day:

$$
x + (x + 4) + \text{(third monkey)} = 45
$$

Let’s solve this equation step by step.

---

### Step 3: Solve for the third monkey's banana consumption

$$
x + (x + 4) + \text{(third monkey)} = 45 \\
2x + 4 + \text{(third monkey)} = 45 \\
\text{(third monkey)} = 45 - 2x - 4 \\
\text{(third monkey)} = 41 - 2x
$$

So the third monkey eats $ 41 - 2x $ bananas per day.

But we need to find the actual value of $ x $, so let’s use the information given about the second monkey.

We already know:

- First monkey eats $ x $
- Second monkey eats $ x + 4 $

So total of first two monkeys:

$$
x + (x + 4) = 2x + 4
$$

Then the third monkey eats the rest:

$$
\text{Third monkey} = 45 - (2x + 4) = 41 - 2x
$$

This matches what we had earlier.

Now, since the number of bananas must be a whole number, and the third monkey eats $ 41 - 2x $, we can try different values of $ x $ to find a valid solution.

Try $ x = 10 $ (a reasonable guess for the first monkey):

- First monkey: $ 10 $
- Second monkey: $ 10 + 4 = 14 $
- Third monkey: $ 45 - 10 - 14 = 21 $

Check total: $ 10 + 14 + 21 = 45 $ ✅

So this works!

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**The third monkey eats 21 bananas each day.**
Let's break the problem down step by step:

1. **First puzzle:**  
   - Teddy finished **half** of a 500-piece puzzle.  
   - Half of 500 is:  
     $$
     \frac{500}{2} = 250
     $$  
     So, he placed **250 pieces** on the first puzzle.

2. **Second puzzle:**  
   - He then **started and finished another 500-piece puzzle within an hour**.  
   - That means he placed all **500 pieces** of the second puzzle in that hour.

3. **Total pieces placed during that hour:**  
   - The question asks how many pieces Teddy placed **during that hour**, which refers to the **second puzzle only** (since the first puzzle was already completed before the hour started).  
   - So, we only count the **500 pieces** from the second puzzle.

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{500}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the cost of the roses**

- **Price per rose:** $2  
- **Number of roses bought:** 15

So, total cost =  
$$
15 \times 2 = \$30
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how much money Jenny has**

She arrived with **five $5 bills**.  
$$
5 \times 5 = \$25
$$

So, she has **\$25**, but the flowers cost **\$30**. That means she is **short by \$5**.

Wait — that’s a problem. She doesn’t have enough money to buy the roses!

But the question says:

> "they only have quarters for change"

That suggests that **the florist only gives change in quarters**, and Jenny needs to receive **change** from her \$25.

But if she only has \$25 and the flowers cost \$30, then she **can't afford the roses** unless she gets **change** from the florist.

This seems like an odd setup — let's double-check.

---

### **Alternative interpretation:**

Maybe the question is asking how many quarters Jenny would get as **change** if she paid with **five $5 bills** (i.e., $25) and the total cost was **less than $25**, so she would receive some **change** in quarters.

Let’s assume the actual cost is less than $25, and the florist gives change in quarters.

We need to figure out **how many quarters she leaves with** — meaning, how many quarters does she receive as **change**?

But we were told she **bought 15 roses** at **$2 each**, which totals **$30**.

So she **needs $30**, but she only had **$25**.

That means she **did not pay with enough money**. So she **wouldn't receive any change** — instead, she would be **short by $5**.

So the answer would be:  
> **She leaves with 0 quarters**, because she didn't have enough money to buy the roses.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**0 quarters**.
Let's calculate Terry's total earnings step by step.

---

### 1. **Milkshakes**
- He sells **6 milkshakes** at **$5.50 each**.
- Total from milkshakes =  
  $$
  6 \times 5.50 = 33.00
  $$

---

### 2. **Burger Platters**
- He sells **9 burger platters** at **$11 each**.
- Total from burger platters =  
  $$
  9 \times 11 = 99.00
  $$

---

### 3. **Sodas**
- He sells **20 sodas** at **$1.50 each**.
- Total from sodas =  
  $$
  20 \times 1.50 = 30.00
  $$

---

### 4. **Total Earnings**
Now, add up all the amounts:

$$
33.00 + 99.00 + 30.00 = 162.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$162.00}
$$
Let's break down the timeline of events and calculate how long Paul will wait for his **fourth train**.

---

### Step 1: First Train
- **Arrival time:** 10 minutes from now.
- **Stay time:** 20 minutes.

So, the **first train arrives at 10 minutes**, and leaves at:
$$
10 + 20 = 30 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 2: Second Train
- Arrives **half an hour after the first train leaves**.
- The first train leaves at **30 minutes**, so the second train arrives at:
$$
30 + 30 = 60 \text{ minutes}
$$
- It stays in the station for **a quarter of the first train’s stay time**.
- First train stayed for 20 minutes → second train stays for:
$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5 \text{ minutes}
$$
So, the **second train leaves at**:
$$
60 + 5 = 65 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Third Train
- Arrives **an hour after the second train leaves**.
- Second train leaves at **65 minutes**, so third train arrives at:
$$
65 + 60 = 125 \text{ minutes}
$$
- It **leaves immediately after arriving**, so it leaves at:
$$
125 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 4: Fourth Train
- Arrives **20 minutes after the third train leaves**.
- Third train leaves at **125 minutes**, so fourth train arrives at:
$$
125 + 20 = 145 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Final Answer:
Paul is waiting from **time 0** until the **fourth train arrives at 145 minutes**.

So, **total waiting time** is:
$$
\boxed{145} \text{ minutes}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many toothpicks Melanie has already saved**

She saves **10 toothpicks per week** for **12 weeks**:

$$
10 \text{ toothpicks/week} \times 12 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ toothpicks}
$$

So, Melanie has already saved **120 toothpicks**.

---

### **Step 2: Find out how many more toothpicks she needs**

The sculpture requires **200 toothpicks**, and she has **120**, so she needs:

$$
200 - 120 = 80 \text{ toothpicks}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how many more weeks it will take her to save 80 toothpicks**

She saves **10 toothpicks per week**, so the number of additional weeks needed is:

$$
\frac{80}{10} = 8 \text{ weeks}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
It will take Melanie **8 more weeks** to collect enough toothpicks for the sculpture.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find the price Mr. Rogers paid for the watch**

The original price of the watch is **$2000**.

Mr. Rogers bought it at **75%** of the original price:

$$
\text{Price Mr. Rogers paid} = 0.75 \times 2000 = 1500
$$

So, Mr. Rogers paid **$1500** for the watch.

---

### **Step 2: Find the price Mr. Rogers sold the watch for**

He sold it to his friend at **120%** of the price he paid:

$$
\text{Selling price} = 1.20 \times 1500 = 1800
$$

So, the watch was sold for **$1800**.

---

### **Step 3: Find the percentage discount from the original price**

Now we want to find what **percentage discount** Mr. Rogers’ friend got **from the original price** of $2000.

That means we want to find how much **less than $2000** the friend paid, and then express that as a percentage of $2000.

$$
\text{Discount amount} = 2000 - 1800 = 200
$$

$$
\text{Percentage discount} = \frac{200}{2000} \times 100 = 10\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{10\%}
$$

Mr. Rogers' friend got a **10% discount** from the original price.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the rate of jellyfish creation
- **One spring** creates **1 jellyfish every second**.

### Step 2: Determine how many seconds are in 4 hours
- There are **60 seconds in a minute**.
- There are **60 minutes in an hour**.
- So, in **1 hour**, there are:
  $$
  60 \text{ seconds/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds}
  $$
- In **4 hours**, there are:
  $$
  4 \times 3600 = 14400 \text{ seconds}
  $$

### Step 3: Calculate jellyfish per spring in 4 hours
- One spring creates **1 jellyfish per second**, so in 14400 seconds, it creates:
  $$
  14400 \text{ jellyfish}
  $$

### Step 4: Multiply by the number of springs
- We have **5 springs**, each creating 14400 jellyfish in 4 hours.
- Total jellyfish created:
  $$
  5 \times 14400 = 72000
  $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{72000}
$$ jellyfish.
We are told:

- Frankie's score was **15 more than twice** Binkie's score.
- Binkie's score is **90**.

Let’s break it down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Define the relationship
Frankie's score = 2 × Binkie's score + 15

---

### Step 2: Plug in Binkie's score
Binkie's score = 90

So,

$$
\text{Frankie's score} = 2 \times 90 + 15
$$

---

### Step 3: Do the math

$$
2 \times 90 = 180
$$
$$
180 + 15 = 195
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Frankie's score was 195.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Given:**
- Distance from home to store = **4 miles**
- James walks **4 miles per hour**
- He walks **halfway** to the store, then realizes he forgot something and **walks back home**
- Then he has to walk again from home to the store

So, we need to calculate how long it took him to reach the store, including the detour.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the halfway point**
Halfway between home and the store is:
$$
\frac{4}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate time for each leg of the trip**

#### **a. From home to halfway (2 miles):**
$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
$$

#### **b. From halfway back home (2 miles):**
$$
\text{Time} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
$$

#### **c. From home to store (4 miles):**
$$
\text{Time} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \text{ hour}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add up all the times**
$$
0.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 2 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{2 \text{ hours}}
$$
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the pricing options**

- **Individual bananas:** $0.80 each  
- **Bunches of bananas:** $3.00 per bunch (and each bunch has an average of 4 bananas)

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many bananas Jenny bought**

Jenny buys **10 bunches**, and each bunch has an average of **4 bananas**:

$$
\text{Total bananas} = 10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate cost if she bought all bananas individually**

If each banana costs $0.80, then:

$$
\text{Cost individually} = 40 \text{ bananas} \times 0.80 \text{ dollars/banana} = 32 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate cost if she bought in bunches**

She bought **10 bunches** at **$3.00 per bunch**:

$$
\text{Cost in bunches} = 10 \text{ bunches} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/bunch} = 30 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Calculate the savings**

$$
\text{Savings} = \text{Cost individually} - \text{Cost in bunches} = 32 - 30 = 2 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{2}
$$

Jenny saved **$2** by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.
We are given:

- Sam and Harry together have **100 feet** of fence.
- Harry gets **60 feet more** than Sam.
- We are asked: **How much is left over for Sam?**

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ S $ = amount of fence Sam gets
- $ H $ = amount of fence Harry gets

From the problem, we know two things:

1. $ S + H = 100 $ (they split all 100 feet)
2. $ H = S + 60 $ (Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam)

---

### Step 2: Substitute equation (2) into equation (1)

Substitute $ H = S + 60 $ into $ S + H = 100 $:

$$
S + (S + 60) = 100
$$

$$
2S + 60 = 100
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ S $

$$
2S = 100 - 60 = 40
$$

$$
S = \frac{40}{2} = 20
$$

So, **Sam gets 20 feet** of fence.

---

### Step 4: Find how much is left over for Sam

Wait — the question asks: **"How much is left over for Sam?"**

This wording is a bit confusing. Let's clarify:

- If Sam gets **20 feet**, and they had **100 feet total**, then the rest goes to Harry.
- But the question says "how much is left over for Sam", which implies that Sam might not be getting all of what he was supposed to — but in this case, **Sam is getting exactly his share** (20 feet), and there is **no leftover** for him.

But perhaps the question is trying to ask: **"How much fence is left after Sam and Harry take their shares?"**

If so, let's compute that:

- Sam gets 20 feet
- Harry gets $ 20 + 60 = 80 $ feet
- Total used: $ 20 + 80 = 100 $
- So, **nothing is left over**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{0}
$$

There is **no fence left over** for Sam.
We are told that a crocodile grows **8 inches in 4 years**, and we want to find out how many inches it will grow in **13 years** at the same rate.

---

### Step 1: Find the growth rate per year

We divide the total growth by the number of years:

$$
\text{Growth rate} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
$$

---

### Step 2: Multiply the rate by the number of years

Now, we multiply the growth rate by 13 years:

$$
\text{Total growth in 13 years} = 2 \text{ inches/year} \times 13 \text{ years} = 26 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{26} \text{ inches}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**

- **Prices of bikes:**
  - MTB = $500
  - BMX = Half the price of MTB → $500 ÷ 2 = **$250**
  - Trekking = $450

- **Total bikes sold in a month:** 300

- **Trekking bikes sold:** Half of total → $ \frac{1}{2} \times 300 = 150 $

- **BMX bikes sold:** 15% of total → $ 0.15 \times 300 = 45 $

- **MTB bikes sold:** Remaining bikes  
  Total sold = 300  
  Trekking + BMX = 150 + 45 = 195  
  So, MTB = 300 − 195 = **105**

---

### **Step 2: Calculate revenue from each type**

- **Revenue from MTB:**  
  $ 105 \text{ bikes} \times \$500 = \$52,500 $

- **Revenue from BMX:**  
  $ 45 \text{ bikes} \times \$250 = \$11,250 $

- **Revenue from Trekking:**  
  $ 150 \text{ bikes} \times \$450 = \$67,500 $

---

### **Step 3: Add up all revenues**

$$
\$52,500 + \$11,250 + \$67,500 = \boxed{\$131,250}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**Marcel earned \$131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.**
Let's break this problem down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the rates
- The **farmer** makes **5 bales per hour**.
- The **truck** removes **3 bales per hour**.
- So, the **net rate of bale production** is:
  
  $$
  5 \text{ bales/hour} - 3 \text{ bales/hour} = 2 \text{ bales/hour}
  $$

### Step 2: Determine how long they work
- They both work for **6 hours**.

### Step 3: Calculate total bales made and removed
- In 6 hours, the farmer makes:
  
  $$
  5 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ bales}
  $$

- In 6 hours, the truck removes:
  
  $$
  3 \text{ bales/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 18 \text{ bales}
  $$

### Step 4: Find the number of bales left in the field
- Total bales made: 30  
- Total bales removed: 18  
- Bales left in the field:

  $$
  30 - 18 = 12
  $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{12} \text{ bales}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how many **hours a week** John spends learning.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the number of classes per day**

- A normal student has **6 periods**.
- John has **2 extra classes**, so he takes:
  $$
  6 + 2 = 8 \text{ classes per day}
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate minutes spent in class per day**

- Each class is **40 minutes long**.
- So, per day:
  $$
  8 \times 40 = 320 \text{ minutes}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Multiply by number of school days per week**

- He goes to school **5 days a week**.
- Total class time per week:
  $$
  320 \times 5 = 1600 \text{ minutes}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Add extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday**

- He spends **1/16 of his weekly minutes** on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.
- First, calculate that amount:
  $$
  \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100 \text{ minutes}
  $$

---

### **Step 5: Total learning time per week**

- Class time: 1600 minutes
- Extra learning time: 100 minutes
- Total:
  $$
  1600 + 100 = 1700 \text{ minutes}
  $$

---

### **Step 6: Convert minutes to hours**

- There are **60 minutes in an hour**.
- So:
  $$
  \frac{1700}{60} = 28.33\overline{3} \text{ hours}
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{28.33 \text{ hours per week}}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Determine the initial height:**
Nathan drops the ball from the **third-floor balcony**, and each **story is 24 feet high**.

So, the **initial height** is:
$$
3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### 2. **Understand the bounce behavior:**
The ball bounces back to **2/3 of its previous height** with each bounce.

---

### 3. **First bounce:**
- Height after first bounce = $ \frac{2}{3} \times 72 = 48 $ feet

---

### 4. **Second bounce:**
- Height after second bounce = $ \frac{2}{3} \times 48 = 32 $ feet

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{32 \text{ feet}}
$$

So, the ball goes **32 feet high on its second bounce**.
We are given the heights of Caroline's four children in feet and inches, and we need to find the height of the **fourth child** in **inches**.

---

### Step 1: Convert all measurements to inches

We know:

- 1 foot = 12 inches

---

### Step 2: First child's height

> The first child is **6 feet tall**.

$$
6 \text{ feet} = 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 3: Second child's height

> The second child is **two inches taller than the first child**.

$$
72 + 2 = 74 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 4: Third child's height

> The third child is **5 inches shorter than the second child**.

$$
74 - 5 = 69 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 5: Fourth child's height

> The fourth child is **three inches taller than the third child**.

$$
69 + 3 = 72 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{72} \text{ inches}
$$
Let's solve this step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the problem**

- Each bag contains **10 apples**.
- The orchard sold a total of **2000 apples** in one day.
- Each bag is sold for **$5**.
- We need to find out how much money the orchard earned that day.

---

### **Step 2: Find out how many bags were sold**

Since each bag has 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:

$$
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200
$$

So, **200 bags** were sold.

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total earnings**

Each bag is sold for $5, so:

$$
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5 = 1000
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$1000}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the total amount of meat

Let the **total weight of the triceratops** be **$ x $** kilograms.

---

### Step 2: T-Rex ate half of it

So, the **Tyrannosaurus rex ate**:

$$
\frac{x}{2}
$$

That leaves:

$$
x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2}
$$

---

### Step 3: Velociraptors scavenged half of what was left

They scavenged **half of the remaining meat**, which is:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
$$

So, after the velociraptors, the amount of meat left is:

$$
\frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4}
$$

---

### Step 4: Allosaurus ate the last 270 kg

We're told that the **Allosaurus ate the last 270 kg**, so:

$$
\frac{x}{4} = 270
$$

---

### Step 5: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{1080} \text{ kilograms}
$$

So, the **triceratops originally had 1080 kilograms of meat**.
Let's solve this step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the area of each wall**

- **North and South Walls**  
  Each is 10 feet wide × 8 feet high = **80 square feet**  
  Since there are two walls:  
  $ 2 \times 80 = 160 $ square feet

- **East and West Walls**  
  Each is 5 feet wide × 8 feet high = **40 square feet**  
  Since there are two walls:  
  $ 2 \times 40 = 80 $ square feet

---

### **Step 2: Total area to be painted**

Add the areas of all four walls:
$$
160 + 80 = 240 \text{ square feet}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Determine how many gallons of paint are needed**

A gallon of paint covers **20 square feet**, so:
$$
\frac{240}{20} = 12 \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the cost**

Each gallon costs **$12**, so:
$$
12 \text{ gallons} \times 12 = \$144
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$144}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find the **likelihood** that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can.

---

### Step 1: Total number of sodas
Ellen had a case of **12 sodas**.

---

### Step 2: Shaken and unshaken sodas
- Ellen **shook 3** of the 12 sodas → **3 shaken**
- The rest are **unshaken**:  
  $$
  12 - 3 = 9 \text{ unshaken}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda for herself
- She leaves **1 unshaken soda** for her friend.
- So now:
  - Shaken: **3**
  - Unshaken: **9 - 1 = 8**

---

### Step 4: Ellen's brother takes:
- **1 shaken** soda
- **2 unshaken** sodas

So now:
- Shaken: $3 - 1 = 2$
- Unshaken: $8 - 2 = 6$

---

### Step 5: What's left?
Now, there are:
- **2 shaken** sodas
- **6 unshaken** sodas

Total remaining:  
$$
2 + 6 = 8 \text{ sodas}
$$

Ellen’s **friend** is going to take one of these 8 sodas. We want to know the **likelihood** (probability) that the soda she takes is **shaken**, which would mean it could spray soda.

---

### Step 6: Probability calculation

Number of **shaken** sodas left: **2**  
Total number of sodas left: **8**

So the probability that Ellen's friend picks a **shaken** soda is:

$$
\frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
$$

Convert to **percentage**:

$$
0.25 \times 100 = \boxed{25\%}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**25%** chance that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the speeds of both trains
- **Train A** is traveling at **60 miles per hour**
- **Train B** is traveling at **half that speed**, so:
  
  $$
  \text{Speed of Train B} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ miles per hour}
  $$

### Step 2: Find the distance each train travels in 3 hours
We use the formula:

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
$$

- **Distance traveled by Train A**:
  $$
  60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
  $$

- **Distance traveled by Train B**:
  $$
  30 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
  $$

### Step 3: Calculate how far apart they are
Since the trains are moving in **opposite directions**, the total distance between them is the **sum** of the distances each has traveled:

$$
\text{Total distance apart} = 180 + 90 = 270 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{270 \text{ miles}}
$$
Let's break this problem down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Determine the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th**

We are looking at the period from **March 1st to April 19th**, inclusive.

- **March has 31 days**, so from **March 1st to March 31st** is **31 days**.
- Then we add **April 1st to April 19th**, which is **19 days**.

So, total number of days =  
$$
31 \text{ (March)} + 19 \text{ (April)} = 50 \text{ days}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the number of days Billy takes off**

Billy takes **20% of the days off**. So,

$$
\text{Days off} = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the number of days Billy works**

$$
\text{Work days} = 50 - 10 = 40 \text{ days}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate how many people Billy helps per day**

Billy can help **2 people per hour**, and he works **3 hours a day**.

$$
\text{People per day} = 2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Total number of people Billy helps**

$$
\text{Total people} = 6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = \boxed{240} \text{ people}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{240}
$$

$$

### Step 2: Determine the number of people in the cars
There are **20 private cars**, and each car carried **3 people**.

$$
\text{People in cars} = 20 \times 3 = 60
$$

### Step 3: Add the people from both buses and cars
$$
\text{Total people inside the church} = 420 + 60 = 480
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{480}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Mike's age**:  
   Mike is 24 years old.

2. **Martha's age**:  
   Martha is 4 years younger than Mike.  
   So, Martha's age = Mike's age - 4  
   $$
   \text{Martha} = 24 - 4 = 20
   $$

3. **Jeff's age**:  
   Jeff is 10 years older than Martha.  
   So, Jeff's age = Martha's age + 10  
   $$
   \text{Jeff} = 20 + 10 = 30
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **Jeff is 30 years old.**
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Find the time to ride the **biggest waterslide**
- Length = 300 feet  
- Speed = 60 feet per minute

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the time to ride the **second biggest waterslide**
- Length = 240 feet  
- Speed = 80 feet per minute

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{240}{80} = 3 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the difference in time

$$
\text{Difference} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
It takes **2 minutes longer** to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate total time per day
Bobby takes:
- **30 minutes** for lunch
- **2 breaks**, each **15 minutes**

So, the total time spent on lunch and breaks per day is:

$$
30 \text{ minutes} + (2 \times 15 \text{ minutes}) = 30 + 30 = 60 \text{ minutes}
$$

### Step 2: Convert to hours
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour:

$$
60 \text{ minutes} = 1 \text{ hour}
$$

So, Bobby spends **1 hour** per day on lunches and breaks.

### Step 3: Multiply by number of days
He does this for **5 days**:

$$
1 \text{ hour/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**5 hours**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Total miles run by all three
The total distance run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is:

$$
52 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 2: Distance run by Amber
Amber ran:

$$
8 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 3: Distance run by Micah
Micah ran **3.5 times** what Amber ran:

$$
3.5 \times 8 = 28 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find how many miles Ahito ran
Now subtract the distances run by Amber and Micah from the total:

$$
\text{Ahito's distance} = 52 - (8 + 28)
$$

$$
= 52 - 36 = 16 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

We are given the following information:

1. A **fifth** of the jellyfish are **large**.
2. A **third** of the **large** jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light.
3. The **other** jellyfish (i.e., the small ones) **always stay blue**.
4. When the UV light is turned on, **6 jellyfish changed color**.

We are to find: **How many jellyfish are in the tank?**

---

### Step 1: Let total number of jellyfish = $ x $

Then:
- Number of **large** jellyfish = $ \frac{1}{5}x $
- Number of **small** jellyfish = $ x - \frac{1}{5}x = \frac{4}{5}x $

---

### Step 2: How many large jellyfish change color?

From the problem:
- A third of the large jellyfish change color:
  $$
  \text{Number of large jellyfish that change color} = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{5}x = \frac{1}{15}x
  $$

These are the only jellyfish that change color — the small ones never do.

---

### Step 3: Use the fact that 6 jellyfish changed color

So:
$$
\frac{1}{15}x = 6
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = 6 \times 15 = 90
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{90}
$$

There are **90 jellyfish** in the tank.
Let's break this down step by step.

We are told:

1. **Caroline is three times older than Ben.**
2. **Ben is two times older than Chris.**
3. **Chris is 4 years old.**

---

### Step 1: Find Ben's age

Ben is **two times older than Chris**.

So:
$$
\text{Ben} = 2 \times \text{Chris}
$$
$$
\text{Ben} = 2 \times 4 = 8
$$

So, **Ben is 8 years old**.

---

### Step 2: Find Caroline's age

Caroline is **three times older than Ben**.

So:
$$
\text{Caroline} = 3 \times \text{Ben}
$$
$$
\text{Caroline} = 3 \times 8 = 24
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{24}
$$

**Caroline is 24 years old.**
Let's break this down step by step to determine **how many more years Lauren needs to work** in order to save enough for a retirement period of 20 years, given her current salary and savings plan.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the problem**

- **Lauren saves 20% of every paycheck.**
- She wants to **save for a retirement period of 20 years**.
- During retirement, she plans to **live on 40% of her current annual salary**.
- Her **current salary is $100,000 per year**.

We need to find out **how many more years she needs to work** to save up enough money so that during her 20-year retirement, she can live off 40% of her current salary.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how much she will need in retirement**

She plans to live on **40% of her current salary** during retirement:

$$
\text{Annual retirement expense} = 0.40 \times \$100,000 = \$40,000
$$

Over **20 years**, she will need:

$$
\text{Total retirement savings needed} = 20 \times \$40,000 = \$800,000
$$

So, **Lauren needs to save $800,000** before she retires.

---

### **Step 3: Determine how much she saves each year**

She saves **20% of her paycheck**, which is based on her **current salary of $100,000**:

$$
\text{Annual savings} = 0.20 \times \$100,000 = \$20,000
$$

So, she saves **$20,000 per year**.

---

### **Step 4: Calculate how many years she needs to work to save $800,000**

$$
\text{Number of years needed} = \frac{\text{Total savings needed}}{\text{Annual savings}} = \frac{\$800,000}{\$20,000} = 40 \text{ years}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Interpret the question**

The question asks:

> "How many more years does Lauren need to work if she plans to save for a retirement period of 20 years?"

This implies that **she already has some savings**, or we are assuming she is currently working and planning to retire in the future.

However, since no information about current savings is provided, we assume she **starts saving now** and needs to work **for 40 years** to have enough to support a 20-year retirement.

So, if she wants to **retire after 20 years**, and she needs to **work for 40 years** to save enough, then she needs to **work 20 more years** than the length of her retirement.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{20 \text{ more years}}
$$

Lauren needs to work **20 more years** to save enough for a 20-year retirement.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total length of ribbon**: 100 centimeters  
2. **First cut**: Marty cuts the ribbon into **4 equal parts**.  
   - So, each of the first 4 parts will be:  
     $$
     \frac{100}{4} = 25 \text{ cm}
     $$

3. **Each of these 4 parts is then divided into 5 equal parts**.  
   - That means each of the 25 cm pieces is cut into 5 equal parts.  
   - So, each final piece will be:  
     $$
     \frac{25}{5} = 5 \text{ cm}
     $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Each final cut will be **5 centimeters long**.
We are told that **40% of the school population is made up of boys**, and there are **240 boys**.

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Let the total number of students in the school be $ x $.

We are told that **40% of the school population is boys**, so:

$$
0.40x = 240
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600
$$

So, the **total number of students** in the school is **600**.

---

### Step 3: Find the number of girls

If the total number of students is 600, and 240 are boys, then the number of girls is:

$$
600 - 240 = 360
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{360}
$$

There are **360 girls** in the school.
Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the pots**: $19  
2. **Cost of the garden soil**: $26  

**Total before discount**:  
$19 + $26 = **$45**

3. **Coupon discount**: $7 off

**Final amount spent**:  
$45 - $7 = **$38**

So, your mom spent **$38** at the gardening shop.
To find the **average height of heels** at the cocktail party, we need to follow these steps:

---

### Step 1: Determine the total number of women
We are told:
- 3 women are wearing **4-inch heels**
- 3 women are wearing **2-inch heels**

So, total number of women =  
$$
3 + 3 = 6
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total height of all heels
- 3 women × 4 inches = 12 inches  
- 3 women × 2 inches = 6 inches  

Total heel height =  
$$
12 + 6 = 18 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the average height of heels
Average = Total heel height ÷ Number of women  
$$
\text{Average} = \frac{18}{6} = 3 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{3} \text{ inches}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Total miles Soledad wants to hike
She wants to hike **9,300 miles** in June.

### Step 2: How many days is she on vacation?
June has **30 days**.

### Step 3: How many miles does she plan to hike per day now?
She plans to hike **twice a day**, and each time she covers **125 miles**.

So, per day:
$$
2 \times 125 = 250 \text{ miles}
$$

### Step 4: Total miles she can hike in June with her current plan
$$
250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles}
$$

### Step 5: How many more miles does she need to hike?
$$
9,300 - 7,500 = 1,800 \text{ miles}
$$

### Step 6: How many more miles per day must she hike?
$$
\frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles/day}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Soledad must hike **60 more miles per day** to complete her journey on time.

\boxed{\$157}
$$

The store will have received **\$157** after all the balls are sold.
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Total amount of apples
Pierre, Paul, and Jacques bought **12 kg** of apples.

---

### Step 2: Peter wants a quarter of that
Peter wants **1/4** of the total apples:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ kg}
$$

So, **Peter gets 3 kg**.

---

### Step 3: Paul wants 1/3 of that
Paul wants **1/3** of the total apples:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ kg}
$$

So, **Paul gets 4 kg**.

---

### Step 4: Total apples taken by Peter and Paul
$$
3 + 4 = 7 \text{ kg}
$$

---

### Step 5: Apples left for James
Total apples = 12 kg  
Apples taken by Peter and Paul = 7 kg  
Apples left =  
$$
12 - 7 = 5 \text{ kg}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**James will have 5 kg of apples left.**
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Raymond started with $21.**  
   - Initial amount = $21

2. **He saved $11 from his allowance.**  
   - Total now = $21 + $11 = **$32**

3. **He spent $5 on a comic book.**  
   - Total now = $32 - $5 = **$27**

4. **He spent $19 on a puzzle.**  
   - Total now = $27 - $19 = **$8**

### ✅ Final Answer: Raymond has **$8** left.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the total budget and what has been spent so far
- **Total budget:** $16  
- **Already spent:** $4  
- **Left after spending $4:**  
  $$
  16 - 4 = 12
  $$

### Step 2: Determine how much was spent on books today
- Anna has **$2 left** in her budget.  
- That means she spent:
  $$
  12 - 2 = 10
  $$
  on books today.

### Step 3: Find the cost of each book
- She bought **2 books**, and both cost the same amount.
- So, the cost of each book is:

Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Find the increase in enrollment
Last year, there were **50 students** enrolled.

This year, there was a **20% increase**.

To find the number of students added:
$$
\text{Increase} = 20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
$$

### Step 2: Add the increase to last year’s enrollment
$$
\text{This year's enrollment} = 50 + 10 = 60
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**60 students** are enrolled this year in the calligraphy class.
We are told that the light on a lighthouse blinks **255 times in 5 minutes**. We need to find out how long it will take for the light to blink **459 times**.

---

### Step 1: Find the rate of blinking (blinks per minute)

We know:
- 255 blinks occur in 5 minutes

So, the rate is:

$$
\text{Rate} = \frac{255 \text{ blinks}}{5 \text{ minutes}} = 51 \text{ blinks per minute}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the rate to find time for 459 blinks

We want to find how many minutes it takes to blink **459 times** at a rate of **51 blinks per minute**.

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{459 \text{ blinks}}{51 \text{ blinks per minute}}
$$

$$
\text{Time} = 9 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{9 \text{ minutes}}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Fish Count**

- **Male guppies:** 4  
- **Female guppies:** 7  
- **Male goldfishes:** 3  
- **Female goldfishes:** 5  

---

### **Step 2: Fishes Purchased**

- **Male guppies:** +2  
- **Female guppies:** +1  
- **Male goldfishes:** +2  
- **Female goldfishes:** +3  

---

### **Step 3: Total Fish Count After Purchase**

**Male fishes:**
- Male guppies: 4 + 2 = **6**
- Male goldfishes: 3 + 2 = **5**
- **Total male fishes = 6 + 5 = 11**

**Female fishes:**
- Female guppies: 7 + 1 = **8**
- Female goldfishes: 5 + 3 = **8**
- **Total female fishes = 8 + 8 = 16**

---

### **Step 4: Difference Between Female and Male Fishes**

- Female fishes: 16  
- Male fishes: 11  
- **Difference = 16 - 11 = 5**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Time taken by Amalia  
Amalia mowed the lawn and it took her:

$$
\text{Amalia's time} = 4 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 2: Time taken by Megan  
Megan walked the dog, which took **2 hours longer** than Amalia's time.

$$
\text{Megan's time} = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 3: Time taken by Dior  
Dior did laundry, and it took her **well over 4 hours longer** than Amalia's time.  
Since Amalia took **4 hours**, "well over 4 hours longer" means more than:

$$
4 + 4 = 8 \text{ hours}
$$

So, Dior's time is **more than 8 hours**. However, the problem does **not specify an exact number**, so we can only say that Dior’s time is **greater than 8 hours**.

But since the question asks for the **total time they all took to do their chores altogether**, and we are not given an exact value for Dior's time, we can’t calculate a **numerical total** unless we assume a specific value for Dior’s time.

However, if we interpret “well over 4 hours longer” as **exactly 4 hours longer**, then:

$$
\text{Dior's time} = 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ hours}
$$

This is the most reasonable assumption in the absence of more information.

---

### Step 4: Total time  
Now, let's add up the times:

- Amalia: 4 hours  
- Megan: 6 hours  
- Dior: 8 hours  

$$
\text{Total time} = 4 + 6 + 8 = 18 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{18 \text{ hours}}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Time to drive one way:**
John takes **2 hours** to drive to his parents' house.

### 2. **Speed:**
He drives at a speed of **70 mph**.

### 3. **Distance one way:**
We can calculate the distance using the formula:

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
$$

$$
\text{Distance one way} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
$$

### 4. **Round trip distance:**
A round trip means going and coming back, so:

$$
\text{Round trip distance} = 140 \, \text{miles} \times 2 = 280 \, \text{miles}
$$

### 5. **Number of visits per month:**
John visits his parents **twice a month**.

### 6. **Total monthly driving distance:**
$$
\text{Total miles per month} = 280 \, \text{miles/trip} \times 2 \, \text{trips/month} = \boxed{560} \, \text{miles/month}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**John drives 560 miles a month** visiting his parents.
We are given:

- In **7 days**, **Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian**.
- **Sofie walks 10 miles every day**.

Let’s break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find how far Sofie walks in 7 days

Sofie walks **10 miles per day** for **7 days**:

$$
\text{Distance Sofie walks} = 10 \times 7 = 70 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 2: Use the relationship between Sofie and Brian

We are told that **in 7 days, Sofie walks twice as far as Brian**. That means:

$$
\text{Distance Sofie walks} = 2 \times (\text{Distance Brian walks})
$$

Substitute in what we found:

$$
70 = 2 \times (\text{Distance Brian walks})
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for Brian's distance

Divide both sides by 2:

$$
\text{Distance Brian walks} = \frac{70}{2} = 35 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{35} \text{ miles}
$$
We are given the following information:

- **Total toys needed**: 400
- **Number of workers**: 5
- **Worker types**:
  - 2 workers produce **6 toys per hour**
  - 2 workers produce **4 toys per hour**
  - 1 worker's production rate is unknown — let’s call it **x toys per hour**
- **Shift length**: 10 hours
- **After the shift, they still need 20 more toys to complete the order**

---

### Step 1: Calculate total number of toys produced by known workers

Let’s calculate how many toys are produced by the first 4 workers in a 10-hour shift.

- 2 workers produce 6 toys/hour → $ 2 \times 6 = 12 $ toys/hour
- 2 workers produce 4 toys/hour → $ 2 \times 4 = 8 $ toys/hour

So together, these 4 workers produce:

$$
12 + 8 = 20 \text{ toys/hour}
$$

Over 10 hours:

$$
20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ toys}
$$

---

### Step 2: Let’s denote the unknown worker's rate as $ x $

The fifth worker produces $ x $ toys per hour. In 10 hours, that worker produces:

$$
10x \text{ toys}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total toys produced in the shift

Add up all the toys produced:

$$
\text{Total toys} = 200 + 10x
$$

But we know that after this shift, **they still need 20 more toys** to reach 400.

So:

$$
200 + 10x + 20 = 400
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve for $ x $

$$
200 + 10x + 20 = 400 \\
220 + 10x = 400 \\
10x = 400 - 220 \\
10x = 180 \\
x = \frac{180}{10} = 18
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{18} \text{ toys per hour}
$$

So, the fifth worker produces **18 toys per hour**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the weights
We are told:
- Kory’s dog weighs **60 pounds**.
- Elijah has **two dogs**:
  - One dog is **one-fourth** the weight of Kory’s dog.
  - Another dog is **half** the weight of Kory’s dog.

### Step 2: Calculate the weights of Elijah's dogs

#### First dog (one-fourth of Kory’s dog):
$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 60 = 15 \text{ pounds}
$$

#### Second dog (half of Kory’s dog):
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ pounds}
$$

### Step 3: Add up all the weights

- Kory’s dog: **60 pounds**
- Elijah’s first dog: **15 pounds**
- Elijah’s second dog: **30 pounds**

$$
\text{Total weight} = 60 + 15 + 30 = 105 \text{ pounds}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{105} \text{ pounds}
$$
We are given a sequence of events involving stickers, and we need to **work backwards** from the end to find out how many stickers Seth originally had.

---

### Step-by-step breakdown:

Let’s define the number of stickers Seth had **at the beginning** as **S**.

---

### Step 1: Seth gives half of his stickers to Luis

- Seth starts with **S** stickers.
- He gives **½S** to Luis.
- So, **Luis receives ½S stickers**.

---

### Step 2: Luis uses half of the stickers and gives the rest to Kris

- Luis has **½S** stickers.
- He uses **½ × ½S = ¼S** stickers.
- So, he gives **½ × ½S = ¼S** stickers to Kris.

---

### Step 3: Kris keeps 9 stickers and gives the remaining 7 to Rob

- Kris receives **¼S** stickers.
- She keeps **9**, and gives **7** to Rob.
- That means:
  $$
  \frac{1}{4}S = 9 + 7 = 16
  $$

---

### Solve for S:

$$
\frac{1}{4}S = 16 \\
S = 16 \times 4 = 64
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.**

---

### **Step 2: Total number of M&Ms**

We are told that **1 ounce of M&Ms contains 30 M&Ms**.

$$
\text{Total M&Ms} = 30 \text{ ounces} \times 30 \text{ M&Ms per ounce} = 900 \text{ M&Ms}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Number of small bags he can make**

Each small bag holds **10 M&Ms**.

$$
\text{Number of small bags} = \frac{900}{10} = 90
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{90}
$$

John can make **90 small bags**.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the total distance around the Earth
The **circumference of the Earth** is given as:

$$
40,000 \text{ kilometers}
$$

### Step 2: Find half of the way around the Earth
We are asked how many days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to **half of the way around the Earth**.

So, we calculate:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 40,000 = 20,000 \text{ kilometers}
$$

### Step 3: Determine how far Alfie flies each day
Alfie flies **400 kilometers every day**.

### Step 4: Calculate how many days it takes to fly 20,000 kilometers
To find the number of days, divide the total distance by the daily distance:

$$
\frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \text{ days}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **The average car can go 120 miles per hour.**

2. **The 2nd fastest car was 5 times faster than the average car.**  
   So, we multiply the speed of the average car by 5:
   $$
   120 \times 5 = 600 \text{ miles per hour}
   $$

3. **The fastest car was 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car.**  
   So, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25:
   $$
   600 \times 1.25 = 750 \text{ miles per hour}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The fastest car can go 750 miles per hour.**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Define the variables
Let’s let:
- Liam’s current age = 16 years (given)
- Vince’s current age = **x** (this is what we need to find)

### Step 2: Use the information given
> Two years ago, Liam’s age was twice the age of Vince.

Two years ago:
- Liam’s age = 16 - 2 = **14**
- Vince’s age = x - 2

According to the problem:
$$
\text{Liam's age two years ago} = 2 \times \text{Vince's age two years ago}
$$
$$
14 = 2(x - 2)
$$

### Step 3: Solve the equation
$$
14 = 2(x - 2)
$$
Divide both sides by 2:
$$
7 = x - 2
$$
Add 2 to both sides:
$$
x = 9
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Vince is currently 9 years old.**
We are given the following information:

- **Total eggs painted:** 56  
- **Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs.**  
- **Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs.**  
- **Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah.**

Let’s define variables for clarity.

---

### Step 1: Define Variables

Let:
- $ A $ = number of eggs Arnold painted  
- $ M $ = number of eggs Madeline painted  
- $ C $ = number of eggs Camden painted  
- $ S $ = number of eggs Sarah painted  

From the problem:

1. $ A = M $ (Arnold and Madeline painted the same number)  
2. $ C + S = 30 $ (Camden and Sarah together painted 30 eggs)  
3. $ C = S + 12 $ (Camden painted 12 more eggs than Sarah)  
4. Total eggs: $ A + M + C + S = 56 $

---

### Step 2: Use Equations to Solve

From (1): $ A = M $

So, substitute into the total equation:

$$
A + M + C + S = 56 \Rightarrow A + A + C + S = 56 \Rightarrow 2A + C + S = 56
$$

Now use equations (2) and (3):

From (2): $ C + S = 30 $

From (3): $ C = S + 12 $

Substitute (3) into (2):

$$
(S + 12) + S = 30 \Rightarrow 2S + 12 = 30 \Rightarrow 2S = 18 \Rightarrow S = 9
$$

Now find $ C $:

$$
C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21
$$

Now we know:

- $ S = 9 $
- $ C = 21 $
- $ C + S = 30 $ ✅

Now go back to the total equation:

$$
2A + C + S = 56 \Rightarrow 2A + 21 + 9 = 56 \Rightarrow 2A + 30 = 56 \Rightarrow 2A = 26 \Rightarrow A = 13
$$

So:
- $ A = 13 $
- $ M = 13 $ (since $ A = M $)
- $ C = 21 $
- $ S = 9 $

---

### Step 3: Answer the Question

**How many more eggs did Camden paint than Arnold?**

$$
C - A = 21 - 13 = \boxed{8}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **8**
Let's solve this step by step:

### **Step 1: Total number of crayons**
Nik has **200 crayons**.

---

### **Step 2: Weight of the crayons**
Each crayon weighs **1 ounce**, so:

$$
\text{Weight of crayons} = 200 \text{ crayons} \times 1 \text{ ounce/crayon} = 200 \text{ ounces}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Number of boxes needed**
He wants to put them into **groups of 8 crayons per box**:

$$
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{200}{8} = 25 \text{ boxes}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Weight of the boxes**
Each box weighs **8 ounces**, so:

$$
\text{Weight of boxes} = 25 \text{ boxes} \times 8 \text{ ounces/box} = 200 \text{ ounces}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Total weight in ounces**
$$
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of crayons} + \text{Weight of boxes} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces}
$$

---

### **Step 6: Convert ounces to pounds**
There are **16 ounces in a pound**, so:

$$
\text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{25} \text{ pounds}
$$
Let's break this problem down step by step to find out how much John makes.

---

### **Step 1: Total length of the tree**
The tree is **80 feet** tall.

---

### **Step 2: Percentage of the tree that can be made into logs**
John can make logs from **80%** of the tree.

So, the usable length is:

$$
0.80 \times 80 = 64 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Length of each log**
He cuts the usable part into **4-foot logs**.

Number of logs = total usable length ÷ length per log:

$$
\frac{64}{4} = 16 \text{ logs}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Number of planks per log**
From each log, he cuts **5 planks**.

Total number of planks = number of logs × planks per log:

$$
16 \times 5 = 80 \text{ planks}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Price per plank**
Each plank sells for **$1.20**.

Total money made = total planks × price per plank:

$$
80 \times 1.20 = 96
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$96}
$$

John makes **\$96** from cutting down and selling the tree.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how much Valerie's brother earns

We are told:

> Valerie earns $5000 per month, which is **1/2** of what her brother earns.

So, if Valerie's salary is **half** of her brother's, then:

$$
\text{Valerie's salary} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Brother's salary}
$$

Let’s call the brother’s salary **B**. Then:

$$
5000 = \frac{1}{2} \times B
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
B = 10,000
$$

✅ So, **Valerie's brother earns $10,000 per month**.

---

### Step 2: Find their combined salary

Now add Valerie's and her brother's salaries:

$$
\text{Combined salary} = 5000 + 10,000 = 15,000
$$

---

### Step 3: Find how much their mother earns

We’re told:

> Their mother earns **twice** their combined salary.

So:

$$
\text{Mother's salary} = 2 \times 15,000 = 30,000
$$

---

### Step 4: Find the total amount they all have together

Add up all three salaries:

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Valerie} + \text{Brother} + \text{Mother}
$$
$$
= 5000 + 10,000 + 30,000 = 45,000
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$45,000}
$$
We are given:

- Grandma walks a total of **3 miles**.
- The walk includes:
  - **2 miles on the beach**
  - **1 mile on the sidewalk**
- On the **sidewalk**, she walks at **twice the rate** she does on the **beach**.
- She spends **40 minutes** walking on the **beach**.

We are to find: **How long does it take for her to complete the entire 3-mile walk, in minutes?**

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ v $ = Grandma's walking speed on the **beach** (in miles per minute)
- Then, her speed on the **sidewalk** is $ 2v $

She walks **2 miles on the beach** and **1 mile on the sidewalk**.

---

### Step 2: Use the time formula

Time = Distance ÷ Speed

#### Time on the beach:
$$
\text{Time}_{\text{beach}} = \frac{2}{v}
$$
We're told this equals **40 minutes**, so:
$$
\frac{2}{v} = 40
$$

Solve for $ v $:
$$
v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}
$$

So her speed on the beach is $ \frac{1}{20} $ miles per minute.

Her speed on the sidewalk is:
$$
2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
$$

---

### Step 3: Time on the sidewalk

She walks **1 mile** on the sidewalk at $ \frac{1}{10} $ miles per minute:

$$
\text{Time}_{\text{sidewalk}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{10}} = 10 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total time

$$
\text{Total time} = \text{Time}_{\text{beach}} + \text{Time}_{\text{sidewalk}} = 40 + 10 = \boxed{50} \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{50} \text{ minutes}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate how much Jane has already saved

Jane saves **$4 per week** and has been saving for **8 weeks**.

$$
\text{Amount saved so far} = 4 \times 8 = 32 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how much more she needs to save

She wants to save a total of **$60**.

$$
\text{Amount still needed} = 60 - 32 = 28 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate how many more weeks it will take

She saves **$4 per week**, so to save **$28**, it will take:

$$
\frac{28}{4} = 7 \text{ weeks}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
It will take Jane **7 more weeks** to save a total of $60.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **First part:**  
   There are **3 trees**, each with **7 blue birds**.  
   So, the total number of blue birds in these 3 trees is:  
   $$
   3 \times 7 = 21
   $$

2. **Second part:**  
   There are **2 different trees**, each with **4 blue birds**.  
   So, the total number of blue birds in these 2 trees is:  
   $$
   2 \times 4 = 8
   $$

3. **Third part:**  
   There is **1 final tree** with **3 blue birds**.  
   So, that’s just:  
   $$
   3
   $$

---

**Now, add all these together to find the total number of blue birds:**

$$
21 + 8 + 3 = 32
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **32 blue birds** in total.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the first part of the problem

> "If he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles."

- A **dozen** is 12.
- So, **2 dozen** = 2 × 12 = **24 marbles**

So, if Bob receives **24 more marbles**, he will have **60 marbles** in total.

Let’s call the number of marbles Bob currently has **x**.

Then:

$$
x + 24 = 60
$$

Now solve for **x**:

$$
x = 60 - 24 = 36
$$

✅ So, Bob currently has **36 marbles**.

---

### Step 2: Now, consider the second part of the problem

> "If he loses 10 of the marbles he has, how many marbles will Bob have?"

We already found that Bob has **36 marbles**. If he loses 10 marbles:

$$
36 - 10 = 26
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{26}
$$

Bob will have **26 marbles** after losing 10.
We are given the following:

- Donny can only drink water **if it's at least 40 degrees**.
- He has **two mugs of water**:
  - One is **33 degrees**.
  - The other is an **unknown temperature**, let's call it **T**.
- He pours **4 ounces from the 33-degree mug** into a bottle.
- He also pours **1 ounce from the unknown-temperature mug** into the same bottle.
- After mixing, he is now able to **drink the water** → that means the **final mixture must be at least 40 degrees**.

We are to find: **What is the minimum possible value of T (the temperature of the second mug)?**

---

### Step 1: Understand the mixing process

Let’s assume all the water is in ounces and we are mixing by volume. We don't know the total amount of water in each mug, but we know how much is poured into the bottle:

- From the first mug (33°F): 4 oz
- From the second mug (T°F): 1 oz

So, the total amount of water in the bottle is **5 oz**.

The final temperature of the mixture will be the **weighted average** of the two temperatures based on the amounts poured in.

Let’s denote:

- $ T_1 = 33^\circ $F (temperature of first mug)
- $ T_2 = T $°F (temperature of second mug)
- $ V_1 = 4 $ oz (amount from first mug)
- $ V_2 = 1 $ oz (amount from second mug)

Then, the final temperature $ T_{\text{final}} $ is:

$$
T_{\text{final}} = \frac{V_1 \cdot T_1 + V_2 \cdot T_2}{V_1 + V_2}
= \frac{4 \cdot 33 + 1 \cdot T}{4 + 1}
= \frac{132 + T}{5}
$$

We are told that after mixing, Donny can drink the water, so:

$$
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
$$

---

### Step 2: Solve the inequality

$$
\frac{132 + T}{5} \geq 40
$$

Multiply both sides by 5:

$$
132 + T \geq 200
$$

Subtract 132 from both sides:

$$
T \geq 68
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{68}
$$

So, the **minimum possible temperature** of the second mug is **68 degrees Fahrenheit**.
Let's solve the problem **step by step**.

---

### **Step 1: Initial number of animals**

Melanie's father starts with:

- **50 cows**
- **20 chickens**

So, the initial total number of animals is:

$$
50 + 20 = 70 \text{ animals}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many days are in three weeks**

There are **7 days in a week**, so:

$$
3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the number of new animals added each day**

- **Milkie Cows Limited adds 20 cows per day**
- **Broilers Limited adds 10 chickens per day**

So, over 21 days:

- **Cows added:**  
$$
20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows}
$$

- **Chickens added:**  
$$
10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add the new animals to the initial count**

- **Total cows after 3 weeks:**  
$$
50 + 420 = 470 \text{ cows}
$$

- **Total chickens after 3 weeks:**  
$$
20 + 210 = 230 \text{ chickens}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Total number of animals on the farm**

$$
470 \text{ cows} + 230 \text{ chickens} = \boxed{700} \text{ animals}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{700}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find the **cost per single bagel** after Russell orders 4 packs.

---

### Step 1: Understand the cost of one pack
- Each pack costs **$10.00**
- Each pack contains **9 bagels**

So, the **cost per bagel without any discount** is:

$$
\frac{10.00}{9} \approx 1.11 \text{ dollars per bagel}
$$

But we are told that if he **orders 4 packs**, he gets a **10% discount on the total price**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 4 packs before discount

$$
4 \times 10.00 = 40.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 3: Apply the 10% discount

$$
10\% \text{ of } 40.00 = 0.10 \times 40.00 = 4.00
$$

$$
\text{Discounted total} = 40.00 - 4.00 = 36.00 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find the total number of bagels in 4 packs

$$
4 \times 9 = 36 \text{ bagels}
$$

---

### Step 5: Calculate the cost per bagel after discount

$$
\frac{36.00}{36} = 1.00 \text{ dollar per bagel}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$1.00} \text{ per bagel}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how many scoops Gomer ate

The problem says:

> **Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.**

So we calculate:

$$
23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
$$

So, **Gomer ate 18 scoops** of mashed potatoes.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many potatoes are needed to make 1 less than 3 scoops

The problem says:

> **It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.**

First, compute the number of scoops:

$$
3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops}
$$

Now compute how many potatoes are needed for those 2 scoops:

$$
6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes}
$$

So, **it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops** of mashed potatoes.

---

### Step 3: Find out how many potatoes per scoop

We now know:

- 3 potatoes make 2 scoops
- So, per scoop, it takes:

$$
\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ potatoes per scoop}
$$

---

### Step 4: Calculate how many potatoes Gomer ate

Gomer ate **18 scoops**, and each scoop requires **1.5 potatoes**:

$$
18 \times 1.5 = 27 \text{ potatoes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{27}
$$

Gomer ate **27 potatoes**.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days
Chester eats **3 eggs per day** for **30 days**.

$$
3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ eggs}
$$

### Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days
Chester then increases his intake to **5 eggs per day** for another **30 days**.

$$
5 \text{ eggs/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 150 \text{ eggs}
$$

### Step 3: Add both amounts to find the total number of eggs needed for 60 days
$$
90 \text{ eggs} + 150 \text{ eggs} = 240 \text{ eggs}
$$

### Step 4: Convert eggs to dozens
There are **12 eggs in a dozen**, so divide the total number of eggs by 12:

$$
\frac{240}{12} = 20 \text{ dozen}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Chester will need 20 dozen eggs for 60 days.**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the given information
- Total number of jellybeans = **60**
- Number of **green** jellybeans = **17**
- Number of **red** jellybeans = **twice as many as green** → $ 2 \times 17 = 34 $
- The rest are **blue** jellybeans

---

### Step 2: Add green and red jellybeans
$$
\text{Green} + \text{Red} = 17 + 34 = 51
$$

---

### Step 3: Subtract from total to find blue jellybeans
$$
\text{Blue} = \text{Total} - (\text{Green} + \text{Red}) = 60 - 51 = 9
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{9}
$$

There are **9 blue jellybeans** in the jar.

1. **Number of trees**: Tim grows **5 trees**.

2. **Lemons per tree per year**: Each tree gives **6 lemons per year**.

3. **Total lemons per year**:
   $$
   5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree/year} = 30 \text{ lemons/year}
   $$

4. **Number of years in a decade**: A decade is **10 years**.

5. **Total lemons in a decade**:
   $$
   30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **300 lemons**
We are given:

- The **ratio of men to women** on the bus is **5:9**
- The **total number of passengers** is **84**
- **20 women alight** at the next stop
- We need to find how many **women remain** on the bus.

---

### Step 1: Use the ratio to find the number of men and women

The ratio of **men : women = 5 : 9**

Let the number of **men** be $ 5x $, and the number of **women** be $ 9x $

So total passengers =  
$$
5x + 9x = 14x
$$

We are told the total number of passengers is **84**, so:

$$
14x = 84 \Rightarrow x = \frac{84}{14} = 6
$$

Now calculate the number of women:

$$
\text{Number of women} = 9x = 9 \times 6 = 54
$$

---

### Step 2: Subtract the number of women who alighted

$$
\text{Women remaining} = 54 - 20 = 34
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{34}
$$ women have remained on the bus.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Given:**

- **Sunflower price:** $2 each  
- **Bouquet price:** $8 each  
- **Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers**  
- **Earnings per day:**  
  - From **sunflowers**: $26  
  - From **bouquets**: $56  

We are asked to find out **how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell in 3 days.**

---

### **Step 1: Find the number of sunflowers sold per day**

Faraday earns **$26 per day from selling sunflowers**, and each sunflower costs **$2**.

So, the number of sunflowers sold per day is:

$$
\frac{26}{2} = 13 \text{ sunflowers/day}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Find the number of bouquets sold per day**

Faraday earns **$56 per day from selling bouquets**, and each bouquet costs **$8**.

So, the number of bouquets sold per day is:

$$
\frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ bouquets/day}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find how many sunflowers are in the bouquets per day**

Each bouquet has **12 sunflowers**, and he sells **7 bouquets per day**.

So, the number of sunflowers in bouquets per day is:

$$
7 \times 12 = 84 \text{ sunflowers/day}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total number of sunflowers sold per day**

He sells:
- **13 sunflowers** as individual flowers
- **84 sunflowers** in bouquets

So, total sunflowers sold per day:

$$
13 + 84 = 97 \text{ sunflowers/day}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Total over 3 days**

$$
97 \times 3 = 291 \text{ sunflowers}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{291}

### **Step 1: Determine how many rocks Adam can buy with $100**

Each rock costs **$5**, so:

$$
\text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\$100}{\$5} = 20 \text{ rocks}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how many rocks he sells**

He sells **60%** of his inventory:

$$
\text{Rocks sold} = 20 \times 0.60 = 12 \text{ rocks}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the revenue from selling the rocks**

He sells each rock for **$7**, so:

$$
\text{Revenue} = 12 \times \$7 = \$84
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate how much money he loses**

Adam originally spent **$100** to buy the rocks.

He only gets back **$84** from selling 60% of them.

So, the amount he **loses** is:

$$
\text{Loss} = \$100 - \$84 = \$16
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$16}
$$

Adam loses **$16**.

5. **Total cost for the month of May**:  
   $$
   \$3/\text{day} \times 31 \text{ days} = \$93
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **\$93**
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Patricia starts with 30 roses.**  
   - So, we begin with: **30 roses**

2. **She gave 24 roses to her mother.**  
   - Subtract 24 from 30:  
     $ 30 - 24 = 6 $  
   - Now she has **6 roses left**.

3. **She bought 15 more roses.**  
   - Add 15 to the 6 she has left:  
     $ 6 + 15 = 21 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **21 roses**
To find **average speed**, we use the formula:

$$
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
$$

---

### Step 1: Find total distance

Sid traveled:
- 110 miles in the first part
- 140 miles in the second part

$$
\text{Total Distance} = 110 + 140 = 250 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find total time

He took:
- 2 hours for the first part
- 3 hours for the second part

$$
\text{Total Time} = 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate average speed

$$
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**50 miles per hour**
We are given:

- **First ticket**: 20% chance of winning.
- **Second ticket**: 3 times more likely to win than the first.

---

### Step 1: Understand the second ticket's probability

The second ticket is **three times more likely** to win than the first. That means:

$$
\text{Probability of second ticket winning} = 3 \times \text{Probability of first ticket winning}
$$

Since the first ticket has a **20%** (or **0.2**) chance of winning, the second ticket has:

$$
3 \times 0.2 = 0.6 \quad \text{or} \quad 60\%
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the probability that **both tickets are winners**

Assuming the two events (first ticket wins and second ticket wins) are **independent**, the probability that **both** tickets win is the product of their individual probabilities:

$$
P(\text{Both win}) = P(\text{First ticket wins}) \times P(\text{Second ticket wins})
$$

$$
P(\text{Both win}) = 0.2 \times 0.6 = 0.12
$$

Convert this to a percentage:

$$
0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{12\%}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the variables

Let’s define:

- Let **C** be the number of seashells Carlos collected.
- Let **J** be the number of seashells Jim collected.
- Let **R** be the number of seashells Carrey collected.

We are told:

1. **Jim collected 27 seashells**, which was **5 more than what Carlos collected**:

$$
J = 27
$$
$$
J = C + 5 \Rightarrow 27 = C + 5 \Rightarrow C = 22
$$

So, **Carlos collected 22 seashells**.

2. **Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey**:

$$
C = 2R \Rightarrow 22 = 2R \Rightarrow R = 11
$$

So, **Carrey collected 11 seashells**.

---

### Step 2: Total number of seashells

Now we add up all the seashells they collected:

$$
\text{Total} = J + C + R = 27 + 22 + 11 = 60
$$

---

### Step 3: Divide equally among the three

They divided the seashells **equally** between themselves (Carlos, Jim, and Carrey):

$$
\frac{60}{3} = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Each person got 20 seashells.**
Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Weekdays**: There are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday).  
   Mason eats **4 carrots each weekday**.  
   So, for the weekdays:  
   $ 5 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ carrots/day} = 20 \text{ carrots} $

2. **Weekend**: There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).  
   Mason eats **5 carrots each day** on the weekend.  
   So, for the weekend:  
   $ 2 \text{ days} \times 5 \text{ carrots/day} = 10 \text{ carrots} $

3. **Total carrots per week**:  
   Add the carrots eaten on weekdays and weekends:  
   $ 20 + 10 = 30 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **30 carrots per week**.
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Time of the first song
- The first song is **5 minutes** long.

### Step 2: Time of the second song
- The second song is **60% longer** than the first.
- To find 60% of 5 minutes:
  $$
  0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes}
  $$
- So, the second song is:
  $$
  5 + 3 = 8 \text{ minutes}
  $$

### Step 3: Total time on the cassette
- Add the times of both songs:
  $$
  5 + 8 = 13 \text{ minutes}
  $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**13 minutes**
Let's break the problem down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the cost and selling price**

- Linus buys a mobile device for **$20**.
- He sells it for **twice the original price**, so:
  
  $$
  \text{Selling Price} = 2 \times 20 = \$40
  $$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the profit per device**

Profit per device is the amount he earns from selling one device minus the cost of buying it:

$$
\text{Profit per device} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 40 - 20 = \$20
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total number of devices sold**

- He bought **2 devices on Monday**.
- He bought **4 devices on Tuesday**.

So, total devices sold:

$$
2 + 4 = 6 \text{ devices}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Total profit**

$$
\text{Total Profit} = \text{Profit per device} \times \text{Total number of devices} = 20 \times 6 = \$120
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\$120}
$$
We are given the following information:

1. **Isabel is 7 feet tall.**
2. **Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel.**
3. **Carl is one foot taller than Ned.**
4. **Carl's cane is half as long as Carl is tall.**

Let’s solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Find Ned's height
Ned is 2 feet shorter than Isabel, who is 7 feet tall:

$$
\text{Ned's height} = 7 - 2 = 5 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find Carl's height
Carl is 1 foot taller than Ned:

$$
\text{Carl's height} = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the length of Carl's cane
Carl's cane is **half as long as he is tall**:

$$
\text{Length of cane} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{3} \text{ feet}
$$
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand what each bottle provides**

Each bottle of carrot juice can cover **20%** of **one person's daily energy demand**.

So, to satisfy **100%** of one person’s daily energy need, we would need:

$$
\frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \text{ bottles}
$$

Therefore, **each person needs 5 bottles of juice per day** to meet their full daily energy needs.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how many bottles are needed for 2300 people**

If **1 person needs 5 bottles**, then:

$$
2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11,500 \text{ bottles}
$$

So, **Hortex needs to produce 11,500 bottles per day** to meet the full energy needs of 2300 people.

---

### **Step 3: How many bottles does Hortex currently produce?**

It is given that Hortex produces **4200 bottles per day**.

---

### **Step 4: How many more bottles are needed?**

$$
11,500 - 4,200 = 7,300
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{7300}
$$

Hortex would have to produce **7300 more bottles** per day to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Total number of babies
Carla has **octuplets**, which means **8 babies** in total.

---

### Step 2: Number of babies dressed in purple and blue

- **3/4** of the babies are dressed in **purple**:
  $$
  \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ babies}
  $$

- The remaining **1/4** are dressed in **blue**:
  $$
  \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ babies}
  $$

So, we have:
- 6 babies in **purple**
- 2 babies in **blue**

---

### Step 3: Who wears bows?

- **All blue-wearers** also wear bows → 2 babies with **bows**.
- **1/3 of the purple-wearers** also wear bows:
  $$
  \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ babies}
  $$

So, total number of babies wearing **bows** is:
$$
2 \text{ (blue)} + 2 \text{ (purple)} = 4 \text{ babies}
$$

---

### Step 4: What is the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple?

Out of the 4 babies wearing bows:
- 2 are wearing **purple**
- 2 are wearing **blue**

So, the probability that a bow-wearing baby is wearing **purple** is:
$$
\frac{\text{Number of purple bow-wearers}}{\text{Total number of bow-wearers}} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5
$$

Convert to percentage:
$$
0.5 \times 100 = \boxed{50\%}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**50%** chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.
We are given:

- **Total tax reports received last week**: 5168  
- **Reports received on Monday and Tuesday combined**: 1907  
- **Reports received on Thursday and Friday combined**: 2136  

We are asked to find how many reports were received on **Wednesday**.

---

### Step 1: Add the reports from Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday

$$
\text{Monday + Tuesday} = 1907 \\
\text{Thursday + Friday} = 2136 \\
\text{Total for these four days} = 1907 + 2136 = 4043
$$

---

### Step 2: Subtract this total from the overall weekly total to find Wednesday's reports

$$
\text{Wednesday reports} = \text{Total reports} - \text{Reports on other days} \\
= 5168 - 4043 = 1125
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**1125 reports were received on Wednesday.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Total land Abraham owns**
Abraham has **80 square meters** of unused land.

---

### **Step 2: First sale – Half of the land**
He sold **half** of his land:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ square meters}
$$

He sold this for **$50**.

So, he earned **$50** from this sale.

---

### **Step 3: Second sale – 1/4 of the original land**
He sold **1/4** of the original 80 square meters:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20 \text{ square meters}
$$

He sold this for **$30**.

So, he earned **$30** from this sale.

---

### **Step 4: Remaining land**
So far, he has sold:

- 40 m² (first sale)
- 20 m² (second sale)

Total sold so far:
$$
40 + 20 = 60 \text{ m²}
$$

Remaining land:
$$
80 - 60 = 20 \text{ m²}
$$

He sold the remaining **20 m²** at **$3 per square meter**:

$$
20 \times 3 = \$60
$$

---

### **Step 5: Total earnings**
Now, add up all the money he earned:

- $50 (first sale)
- $30 (second sale)
- $60 (remaining land)

$$
50 + 30 + 60 = \boxed{\$140}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Abraham will earn a total of $\boxed{140}$ dollars after selling all his unused land.**
We are given:

- **Haley is 26 years old.**
- **Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley.**

### Step 1: Find half of Haley's age
$$
\frac{1}{2} \times 26 = 13
$$

### Step 2: Subtract 10 from that result
$$
13 - 10 = 3
$$

### Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{3}
$$

So, **Geb is 3 years old.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out.**  
   - So, for each outing, he uses 2 masks.

2. **He goes out three times a day.**  
   - That means in one day, he goes out 3 times.

3. **How many masks does he use in one day?**  
   - Masks per day = 2 masks/outing × 3 outings/day = **6 masks/day**

4. **How many masks does he use in 2 days?**  
   - Masks in 2 days = 6 masks/day × 2 days = **12 masks**

### ✅ Final Answer: **12 face masks**
Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Total number of eggs
Cole hid **3 dozen eggs**.  
Since 1 dozen = 12 eggs,  
$$
3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}
$$

---

### Step 2: Eggs found by each person

- **Lamar finds 5 eggs.**  
- **Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar:**  
  $$
  2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs}
  $$
- **Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy:**  
  $$
  10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs}
  $$
- **Mei finds half as many as Charlie:**  
  $$
  \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ eggs}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Total eggs found

Add up the eggs found by all four:
$$
5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs}
$$

---

### Step 4: Eggs still hidden

Subtract the eggs found from the total:
$$
36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{9} \text{ eggs are still hidden in the yard.}
$$
Let's break this down step by step to find out how much money John makes in a week.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the number of apartments**

- The **first two** apartment complexes each have **200 apartments**.
  - So, total for first two = $2 \times 200 = 400$ apartments
- The **third complex** is **60% bigger** than the other two combined.
  - That means it has:
    $$
    400 + (0.60 \times 400) = 400 + 240 = 640 \text{ apartments}
    $$

---

### **Step 2: Total number of apartments across all three complexes**

$$
400 \text{ (first two)} + 640 \text{ (third)} = 1040 \text{ apartments}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Number of garbage collections per week**

John collects garbage **3 times a week from each place**.

So total number of collections per week:

$$
1040 \text{ apartments} \times 3 \text{ collections per apartment} = 3120 \text{ collections}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Payment per collection**

He gets paid **$0.40 per collection**.

So total weekly earnings:

$$
3120 \text{ collections} \times 0.40 = 1248 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{\$1248}
$$

John makes **\$1248 per week**.
Let's solve this step by step.

We are told:

- A **5-year-old** avocado tree produces **50 fruits**.
- A **6-year-old** produces **3 times** the initial amount (i.e., 3 × 50 = **150 fruits**).
- A **7-year-old** produces **7 times** the initial amount (i.e., 7 × 50 = **350 fruits**).
- A **8-year-old** produces **200 fruits less than a 10-year-old**.
- A **9-year-old** produces **0 fruits**.
- A **10-year-old** produces **20 times** the initial amount (i.e., 20 × 50 = **1000 fruits**).

We are to find the **total number of fruits** produced during the **10 years** of the tree's life.

---

### Step-by-step breakdown:

| Age | Fruits Produced |
|-----|------------------|
| 5   | 50               |
| 6   | 3 × 50 = 150     |
| 7   | 7 × 50 = 350     |
| 8   | Let’s call this X. We know that: <br> X = 10-year-old fruits – 200 <br> But we also know that 10-year-old = 20 × 50 = 1000 <br> So, X = 1000 – 200 = **800** |
| 9   | 0                |
| 10  | 20 × 50 = 1000   |

Now sum up all the fruits from year 5 to year 10:

$$
\text{Total} = 50 + 150 + 350 + 800 + 0 + 1000
$$

$$
\text{Total} = 2350
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**2350 fruits** in total over 10 years.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Jack initially has $100.**

2. **Sophia gives Jack 1/5 of her $100.**

   - First, find out how much 1/5 of $100 is:
     $$
     \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = 20
     $$

3. **Add that amount to Jack's original $100:**
   $$
   100 + 20 = 120
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **Jack now has $120.**
We are given the following information:

1. The **red rope** was **four times** the length of the **blue rope**.
2. The **blue rope** was **7 centimeters shorter** than the **yellow rope**.
3. The **combined length** of all three ropes is **37 centimeters**.

Let’s define variables for the lengths of the ropes:

- Let $ B $ be the length of the **blue rope** (in cm).
- Then, the **red rope** is $ 4B $.
- Since the blue rope is 7 cm shorter than the yellow rope, the **yellow rope** is $ B + 7 $.

Now, we can write an equation for the total length:

$$
\text{Red} + \text{Blue} + \text{Yellow} = 37
$$

Substitute the expressions:

$$
4B + B + (B + 7) = 37
$$

Simplify:

$$
4B + B + B + 7 = 37
$$
$$
6B + 7 = 37
$$

Subtract 7 from both sides:

$$
6B = 30
$$

Divide by 6:

$$
B = 5
$$

So the **blue rope** is **5 cm** long.

Now, find the **red rope**:

$$
\text{Red rope} = 4B = 4 \times 5 = \boxed{20} \text{ cm}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **20 centimeters**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

---

### Step 1: Determine how much money each person has initially

- **Ronnie** is given **$5**.
- **Rissa** is given **3 times as much** as Ronnie, so:
  
  $$
  \text{Rissa's money} = 3 \times 5 = 15
  $$

So:

- **Ronnie starts with $5**
- **Rissa starts with $15**

---

### Step 2: Let’s define the amount each gave to their little sister

Let’s say **each of them gave x dollars** to their little sister.

So:

- **Ronnie gives away x**, and is left with $ (5 - x) $
- **Rissa gives away x**, and is left with $ (15 - x) $

We are told that after giving away x dollars, **Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money**. So:

$$
15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15
$$

Solve this equation:

$$
15 - x = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12
$$

Now solve for x:

$$
x = 15 - 12 = 3
$$

So, **each gave away $3**.

---

### Step 3: Find out how much money is left in Ronnie's pocket

Ronnie started with $5 and gave away $3, so:

$$
\text{Ronnie's remaining money} = 5 - 3 = 2
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{2}
$$

Ronnie is left with **$2**.
We are given the following information:

- The mural uses **four colors**: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- **Equal amounts** of **red, white, and purple** paint are used.
- **Half** of the mural is **yellow**.
- The total amount of paint used is **12 pints**.

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let the amount of **red**, **white**, and **purple** paint be **x** pints each (since they are equal).

Then the amount of **yellow** paint is **half the total**, so:

$$
\text{Yellow} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pints}
$$

---

### Step 2: Write the equation for total paint

Total paint = red + white + purple + yellow  
$$
x + x + x + 6 = 12
$$

Simplify:

$$
3x + 6 = 12
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for x

$$
3x = 12 - 6 = 6 \\
x = 2
$$

---

### Step 4: Answer the question

The amount of **red paint** used is **x = 2 pints**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**2 pints of red paint** were used.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the area of one bedroom

Each bedroom is **20 feet by 12 feet**:

$$
\text{Area of one bedroom} = 20 \times 12 = 240 \text{ square feet}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total area of the 4 bedrooms

$$
\text{Total bedroom area} = 4 \times 240 = 960 \text{ square feet}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the area of the living room

The problem says the **living room is 5 times bigger than one bedroom**:

$$
\text{Living room area} = 5 \times 240 = 1200 \text{ square feet}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add the rest of the house

The problem also says that the **rest of the house** (which includes things like hallways, bathrooms, etc.) is **1000 square feet**.

---

### Step 5: Add all areas to find the total area of the house

$$
\text{Total area} = \text{Bedrooms} + \text{Living room} + \text{Rest of the house}
$$
$$
\text{Total area} = 960 + 1200 + 1000 = \boxed{3160} \text{ square feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{3160} \text{ square feet}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the pattern**

- On **Monday**, Alice counts **3** puffs.
- From **Tuesday to Friday**, she sees **double** the number of clouds each day compared to the previous day.

So the number of cloud puffs each day is:

- **Monday**: 3
- **Tuesday**: 2 × 3 = 6
- **Wednesday**: 2 × 6 = 12
- **Thursday**: 2 × 12 = 24
- **Friday**: 2 × 24 = 48

---

### **Step 2: Add them up**

Now, add all the numbers together:

$$
3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48 = ?
$$

Let’s do it step by step:

- 3 + 6 = 9  
- 9 + 12 = 21  
- 21 + 24 = 45  
- 45 + 48 = **93**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Alice will have counted 93 puffs of clouds across all five days.**
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the original box
- A **regular box** has **100 dishwasher pods**.
- It costs **$12**.

So, the cost per pod in the regular box is:

$$
\frac{12}{100} = 0.12 \text{ dollars per pod}
$$

---

### Step 2: Understand the special box
- The **special box** also costs **$12**, but it has **20% more pods** than the regular box.

So, number of pods in the special box is:

$$
100 + (20\% \times 100) = 100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find how many cycles you can run with $1 using the special box

Since the special box has **120 pods** for **$12**, we can find out how many pods you get for **$1**:

$$
\frac{120 \text{ pods}}{12 \text{ dollars}} = 10 \text{ pods per dollar}
$$

Now, since each cycle uses **1 pod**, you can run:

$$
10 \text{ cycles per dollar}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{10} \text{ dishwashing cycles for $1}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills**

So, he has:

$$
\frac{1000}{20} = 50 \text{ bills}
$$

---

### **Step 2: He loses 10 bills while getting home**

He now has:

$$
50 - 10 = 40 \text{ bills}
$$

---

### **Step 3: He uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill**

Half of 40 is:

$$
\frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ bills}
$$

So, he uses 20 bills to pay for a bill. That means he now has:

$$
40 - 20 = 20 \text{ bills left}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Thomas then triples his money**

Now we need to clarify what "triples his money" means. Since he has bills (not cash), and we are dealing with **bills**, it likely means he **triples the number of bills** he has.

So:

$$
20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ bills}
$$

---

### **Step 5: He converts all his bills to $5 bills**

So, he now has 60 bills, each worth $5. So total value is:

$$
60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ dollars}
$$

But the question asks:

> **How many 5 dollar bills does he have?**

That’s just the number of bills, not the total value.

So, the answer is:

$$
\boxed{60}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **60 five-dollar bills**
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **First Half:**

- Team A scores **4 goals**.
- Team B scores **2 goals fewer than Team A**, so:
  $$
  \text{Team B (first half)} = 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ goals}
  $$

---

### **Second Half:**

- Team B scores **4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half**:
  $$
  \text{Team B (second half)} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ goals}
  $$

- Team A scores **1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half**:
  $$
  \text{Team A (second half)} = \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ goals}
  $$

---

### **Total Goals Scored in the Match:**

- Team A total: $ 4 + 2 = 6 $
- Team B total: $ 2 + 8 = 10 $

$$
\text{Total goals} = 6 + 10 = \boxed{16}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **16 goals**.
We are given the following:

- The teacher starts with a **5-inch** piece of chalk.
- He uses **20% of the chalk each day**, **except on Monday**, when he used **45%** of the chalk.
- He **recycles the chalk** when it becomes **smaller than 2 inches**.

We need to find **how many days** the teacher can use the chalk before it becomes smaller than 2 inches (i.e., before he has to recycle it).

---

### Step 1: Understand the usage pattern

Let’s define:

- On **Monday**, he used **45%** of the original chalk.
- From **Tuesday onward**, he uses **20%** of the remaining chalk each day.

We want to find how many full days (starting from Tuesday) he can use the chalk before it drops below **2 inches**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate remaining chalk after Monday

He started with **5 inches**.

On Monday, he used **45%** of that:

$$
\text{Chalk used on Monday} = 0.45 \times 5 = 2.25 \text{ inches}
$$

So, remaining chalk at the end of Monday is:

$$
5 - 2.25 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 3: Use 20% of the remaining chalk each day

Now, starting from **Tuesday**, he will use **20%** of the **current amount** of chalk each day.

We’ll keep track of the chalk length after each day until it drops below **2 inches**.

Let’s denote the remaining chalk as $ C $, and we'll update it each day using:

$$
C_{\text{new}} = C_{\text{old}} \times (1 - 0.20) = C_{\text{old}} \times 0.80
$$

We start with:

$$
C_0 = 2.75 \text{ inches}
$$

Let’s compute the chalk length for each day:

#### Day 1 (Tuesday):
$$
C_1 = 2.75 \times 0.80 = 2.20 \text{ inches}
$$

#### Day 2 (Wednesday):
$$
C_2 = 2.20 \times 0.80 = 1.76 \text{ inches}
$$

Now, since **1.76 < 2**, the chalk is below 2 inches — so he needs to **recycle** it.

---

### Step 4: Count the number of days before recycling

He used the chalk on:

- **Monday** (used 45%)
- **Tuesday** (first day of 20% usage)
- **Wednesday** (second day of 20% usage)

So, the total number of days before recycling is:

$$
\boxed{3 \text{ days}}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{3 \text{ days}}
$$
We are given:

- Miss Albert's class has **12 boys** and **12 girls**, so the total number of students is:

$$
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ students}
$$

---

### Step 1: Find how many girls are on varsity

One-third of the girls are on varsity:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4 \text{ girls on varsity}
$$

---

### Step 2: Find how many boys are on varsity

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 12 = 3 \text{ boys on varsity}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total number of students on varsity

$$
4 \text{ (girls)} + 3 \text{ (boys)} = 7 \text{ students on varsity}
$$

---

### Step 4: Number of students **not** on varsity

$$
24 \text{ (total students)} - 7 \text{ (varsity students)} = 17
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{17}
$$ students are not on varsity.
Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Mike bought 5 face masks.**

2. **Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike.**

   - First, find **thrice as many as Mike**:
     $$
     3 \times 5 = 15
     $$

   - Then add 2 to that amount:
     $$
     15 + 2 = 17
     $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **Johnny bought 17 face masks.**
Let's break the problem down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the total number of teeth
James has **30 teeth** in total.

---

### Step 2: Determine how many teeth are drilled
The dentist **drills 4 teeth**.

---

### Step 3: Determine how many teeth are capped
The dentist **caps 7 more teeth than he drills**.

So, the number of capped teeth is:
$$
4 + 7 = 11 \text{ teeth}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find the total number of teeth fixed
The dentist fixes both the **drilled** and **capped** teeth. So:

$$
\text{Total fixed teeth} = 4 \text{ (drilled)} + 11 \text{ (capped)} = 15 \text{ teeth}
$$

---

### Step 5: Calculate the percentage of teeth fixed
To find the percentage of James' teeth that were fixed:

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Fixed teeth}}{\text{Total teeth}} \right) \times 100
= \left( \frac{15}{30} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**50%** of James' teeth are fixed.
Let's break this down step by step to calculate how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds.

---

### **Step 1: Total amount of milk purchased**

Mr. Marcellus bought **4000 gallons** of milk at **$3.5 per gallon**.

$$
\text{Total cost} = 4000 \times 3.5 = 14,000 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine the amount of expired milk**

He realized that **2/5** of the milk had passed its expiry date.

$$
\text{Expired milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 = 1600 \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate refund amount**

The company refunded him for the expired milk at the same rate of **$3.5 per gallon**.

$$
\text{Refund amount} = 1600 \times 3.5 = 5600 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$5600}
$$

Mr. Marcellus received **\$5600** as a refund for the expired milk.
We are given two statements about the ages of Wendy and Colin. Let's define variables first:

Let:
- $ C $ = Colin's current age
- $ W $ = Wendy's current age

---

### Step 1: Translate the first statement

**"Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now."**

In 7 years, Colin will be $ C + 7 $ years old.

So, according to this statement:

$$
W = 5(C + 7)
$$

---

### Step 2: Translate the second statement

**"In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now."**

In 25 years, Colin will be $ C + 25 $ years old.

This is **a third of Wendy's current age**, so:

$$
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
$$

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

$$
3(C + 25) = W
$$

---

### Step 3: Now we have two equations:

From Step 1:
$$
W = 5(C + 7)
$$

From Step 2:
$$
W = 3(C + 25)
$$

Set the two expressions for $ W $ equal to each other:

$$
5(C + 7) = 3(C + 25)
$$

---

### Step 4: Solve the equation

Expand both sides:

$$
5C + 35 = 3C + 75
$$

Subtract $ 3C $ from both sides:

$$
2C + 35 = 75
$$

Subtract 35 from both sides:

$$
2C = 40
$$

Divide by 2:

$$
C = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Colin is currently 20 years old.**
We are told:

- Bob spends **$27,000** in total.
- He distributes this money among **3 schools**.
- He can buy **100 books for $500**.

We are asked: **How many books can he buy per school?**

---

### Step 1: Determine how much money each school gets

Bob splits the $27,000 evenly among 3 schools:

$$
\text{Money per school} = \frac{27,000}{3} = 9,000
$$

So, each school gets **$9,000**.

---

### Step 2: Find out how many books can be bought with $9,000

We know that:

$$
\frac{100 \text{ books}}{500 \text{ dollars}} = \frac{1 \text{ book}}{5 \text{ dollars}}
$$

So, for every **$5**, you can buy **1 book**.

Now, let's find how many books can be bought with **$9,000**:

$$
\frac{9,000}{5} = 1,800 \text{ books}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Bob can buy 1,800 books per school.**
Let's break down the problem step by step to figure out how many apples Newton brought home.

---

### **Step 1: Initial apples that fell**
- Two apples fell out of the tree.
- One apple landed on Newton's head.
- The other apple he picked up and threw back into the tree.

So far:
- **Total apples that fell**: 2  
- **Apples Newton picked up initially**: 1 (the one not on his head)  
- **Apple thrown back into the tree**: 1

---

### **Step 2: Throwing one apple into the tree causes more apples to fall**
- Newton throws one apple into the tree, causing **5 more apples** to fall.
- So now, **5 new apples** have fallen from the tree.

Now, total apples that have fallen:
- From Step 1: 2
- From Step 2: 5  
→ Total so far: **7 apples**

Newton picks up these 5 apples.

He puts **all but one** in his pocket, meaning:
- He keeps **1 apple** and throws the remaining **4** back into the tree.

So:
- Apples thrown back: 4  
- Apples kept: 1 (put in pocket)

Now, **another 6 apples** fall from the tree due to the 4 apples being thrown back.

So:
- **6 more apples** fall from the tree.

Now, total apples that have fallen:
- From Step 1: 2  
- From Step 2: 5  
- From Step 3: 6  
→ Total: **13 apples**

Newton picks up all of these **6 apples**.

---

### **Step 3: Final pick-up**
- Newton picks up the **6 apples** that fell in Step 3.
- He brings them **home**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Newton brought home 6 apples.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine how many bags of coal Ali needs
Ali wants **850 kg** of coal, and each bag contains **50 kg**.

$$
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{850}{50} = 17
$$

So, Ali needs **17 bags** of coal.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost
Each bag costs **$18**.

$$
\text{Total cost} = 17 \times 18 = 306
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The total cost of Ali's order is $306.**
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many **pizza pies** Kate needs to buy.

---

### Step 1: Understand the setup

- **Cheese pizza** is cut into **12 slices**.
- **Pepperoni pizza** is cut into **8 slices**.
- Kate has **6 friends**, and **each friend eats**:
  - **6 cheese slices**
  - **4 pepperoni slices**

So, we need to find out:

- How many **cheese slices** are eaten in total?
- How many **pepperoni slices** are eaten in total?

Then, based on that, determine how many **whole pizzas** (pies) are needed for each type of pizza.

---

### Step 2: Calculate total slices consumed

#### Cheese slices:
Each of the 6 friends eats 6 slices.

$$
6 \text{ friends} \times 6 \text{ slices per friend} = 36 \text{ cheese slices}
$$

#### Pepperoni slices:
Each of the 6 friends eats 4 slices.

$$
6 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 24 \text{ pepperoni slices}
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine how many whole pizzas are needed

#### Cheese pizza:
Each cheese pizza has **12 slices**.

$$
\frac{36 \text{ slices}}{12 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ cheese pizzas}
$$

#### Pepperoni pizza:
Each pepperoni pizza has **8 slices**.

$$
\frac{24 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total number of pizzas needed

$$
3 \text{ cheese pizzas} + 3 \text{ pepperoni pizzas} = \boxed{6} \text{ pizza pies}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Kate needs to buy 6 pizza pies.**
Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday, Wednesday, and Friday** – Sam ran **3 miles each day**.  
   That’s 3 days × 3 miles = **9 miles**

2. **Tuesday and Thursday** – Sam ran **5 miles each day**.  
   That’s 2 days × 5 miles = **10 miles**

Now, add the two totals together:

**9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles**

### ✅ Final Answer: **19 miles**
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Given:**
- Jay builds **20 snowballs per hour**.
- **2 snowballs melt every 15 minutes**.
- We want to know how long it will take for Jay to have **60 snowballs**.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the rate of snowball production and loss**

#### **Snowball building rate:**
Jay makes **20 snowballs per hour**.

So, in **1 minute**, he makes:

$$
\frac{20}{60} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ snowballs per minute}
$$

#### **Snowball melting rate:**
2 snowballs melt every **15 minutes**.

So, in **1 minute**, **2/15** snowballs melt.

---

### **Step 2: Net rate of snowball accumulation**

Now, we find the **net rate** of snowball increase per minute:

$$
\text{Net rate} = \text{Building rate} - \text{Melting rate}
= \frac{1}{3} - \frac{2}{15}
$$

To subtract these fractions, get a common denominator:

$$
\frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{15}, \quad \frac{2}{15} = \frac{2}{15}
$$

$$
\text{Net rate} = \frac{5}{15} - \frac{2}{15} = \frac{3}{15} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ snowballs per minute}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Time to reach 60 snowballs**

If Jay gains **1/5 of a snowball per minute**, how many minutes does it take to get **60 snowballs**?

$$
\text{Time (in minutes)} = \frac{60}{\frac{1}{5}} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ minutes}
$$

Convert that to hours:

$$
\frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

It will take **5 hours** for Jay to have 60 snowballs.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the timeline

- **Digimon had its 20th anniversary.**  
  That means Digimon was first released **20 years ago** from today.

- **When it came out (20 years ago), John was twice as old as Jim.**

- **Now, John is 28 years old.**

We need to find **Jim's current age**.

---

### Step 2: Set up variables

Let’s define:

- Let **J** be Jim’s current age.
- Then, **John’s current age** is given as **28**.
- Since Digimon was released **20 years ago**, that means we're looking at events that happened **20 years ago**.

So, **20 years ago**, their ages were:

- John’s age = 28 - 20 = **8 years old**
- Jim’s age = J - 20

From the problem:

> When it came out (20 years ago), John was **twice as old as Jim**.

So:

$$
\text{John's age 20 years ago} = 2 \times \text{Jim's age 20 years ago}
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
8 = 2 \times (J - 20)
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve the equation

$$
8 = 2(J - 20)
$$

Divide both sides by 2:

$$
4 = J - 20
$$

Add 20 to both sides:

$$
J = 24
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Jim is currently 24 years old.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Doxa ate 1 slice** of apple.
2. Her **sister ate 1 more than Doxa**, so:
   $$
   1 + 1 = 2 \text{ slices}
   $$
3. Her **brother ate 1 more than her sister**, so:
   $$
   2 + 1 = 3 \text{ slices}
   $$

Now, let's add up all the slices they ate:

$$
\text{Doxa} + \text{Sister} + \text{Brother} = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
$$

### ✅ Final Answer: **6 slices** of apple were eaten in total.
We are given a scenario involving the usage and ordering of bandages over three days, and we're asked to find how many **bandages they started with on the first day**.

---

### Let's define:

Let **B** be the number of bandages they had at the beginning (on Day 1).

We will track the changes in the number of bandages over the three days.

---

### **Day 1:**

- They used **38 bandages**
- They ordered **1 bulk pack of 50 bandages**

So, the change in bandages is:
$$
\text{Bandages after Day 1} = B - 38 + 50 = B + 12
$$

---

### **Day 2:**

- They used **10 fewer bandages than Day 1**, so:
  $$
  \text{Used on Day 2} = 38 - 10 = 28
  $$
- No new order mentioned, so no addition.
  
So, the change in bandages is:
$$
\text{Bandages after Day 2} = (B + 12) - 28 = B - 16
$$

---

### **Day 3:**

- They ordered **2 bulk packs** of 50 bandages → that’s **100 bandages**
- They used **half a pack**, which is **25 bandages**

So, the change in bandages is:
$$
\text{Bandages after Day 3} = (B - 16) + 100 - 25 = B + 69
$$

---

### Final Information:

At the end of Day 3, they had **78 bandages left**. So:

$$
B + 69 = 78
$$

Solving for **B**:

$$
B = 78 - 69 = 9
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{9}
$$

They started with **9 bandages** on the first day.
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Cost of the color**
- The cost for the **color** is a flat fee:  
  **$40**

---

### **Step 2: Cost of the haircut**
- The cost is **$30 per inch** of haircut.
- May started with **10 inches** of hair and ended with **8 inches**.
- So, the amount of hair cut =  
  $ 10 - 8 = 2 $ inches

- Cost of the haircut =  
  $ 2 \text{ inches} \times \$30/\text{inch} = \$60 $

---

### **Step 3: Total cost**
- Total cost = Cost of color + Cost of haircut  
  $ = \$40 + \$60 = \$100 $

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**\$100**
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Jen will receive in April.

---

### **1. Daily Work Hours**
Jen works **7.5 hours per day**.

---

### **2. Days Worked Per Week**
She works **6 days a week**.

So, weekly work hours =

7.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 6 \text{ days/week} = 45 \text{ hours/week}
$$

---

### **3. Weekly Pay (Hourly Rate)**
Her hourly rate is **$1.5**.

Weekly pay from hours worked =  
$$
45 \text{ hours/week} \times \$1.5/\text{hour} = \$67.50 \text{ per week}
$$

---

### **4. Attendance Bonus**
Jen receives an additional **$10** if she has complete attendance for the week.

Since she had **no absences**, she gets this bonus **each week**.

---

### **5. Total Weekly Earnings**
$$
\$67.50 \text{ (from hours)} + \$10 \text{ (bonus)} = \$77.50 \text{ per week}
$$

---

### **6. Number of Weeks in April**
There are exactly **4 weeks** in April.

---

### **7. Total Earnings for April**
$$
\$77.50 \text{ per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = \$310
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$310}

### **Total earnings:**

$$
\$3.00 + \$1.50 + \$1.50 + \$3.00 = \boxed{\$9.00}
$$

---

### ✅ **Answer: Jason earned $9.00 in total.**
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Blood in one whale**:  
   Each whale has **40 gallons** of blood.

2. **Blood in one shark**:  
   A shark has **three times as much blood** as a whale.  
   So,  
   $$
   3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ gallons}
   $$

3. **Blood in ten sharks**:  
   If one shark has 120 gallons of blood, then ten sharks have:  
   $$
   10 \times 120 = 1200 \text{ gallons}
   $$

Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the number of people who entered first

Let’s say:

- **First group**: 50 people entered in the morning.
  
---

### Step 2: People who entered at 10:00

- **Second group**: 40 people entered at 10:00.

---

### Step 3: People who came later (twice the number who entered at 10:00)

- The second group had 40 people, so **twice that** is:
  
  $$
  2 \times 40 = 80
  $$

- So, **third group**: 80 people came in and ordered lunch.

---

### Step 4: Additional people by evening

- It says: "an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first."

- First group = 50 people  
- 3 times that =  
  $$
  3 \times 50 = 150
  $$

- So, **fourth group**: 150 people entered by evening.

---

### Step 5: Total number of people

Now add all the groups together:

$$
\text{Total} = 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = \boxed{320}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{320}
$$ people entered the restaurant on that day.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the quantities
- Alain's mom bought **5 packs of red pens**.
- She also bought **twice the amount of black pens than the red**.
- Each pack has **5 pens**.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the number of red pens
- Each pack has 5 pens.
- There are 5 packs of red pens.

$$
\text{Red pens} = 5 \text{ packs} \times 5 \text{ pens per pack} = 25 \text{ pens}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the number of black pens
- She bought **twice the amount of black pens as red pens**.

$$
\text{Black pens} = 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ pens}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total number of pens
$$
\text{Total pens} = \text{Red pens} + \text{Black pens} = 25 + 50 = \boxed{75}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Alain has 75 pens.**
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Cost of Scotch

John buys **10 bottles** of scotch for a total cost of **$600**.

So, the **cost per bottle of scotch** is:

$$
\frac{600}{10} = 60 \text{ dollars per bottle}
$$

---

### Step 2: Number of Cognac Bottles

He buys **twice as many bottles of cognac** as scotch.

Since he bought **10 bottles of scotch**, he buys:

$$
2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ bottles of cognac}
$$

---

### Step 3: Cost of Cognac per Bottle

Cognac costs **50% more per bottle** than scotch.

We already found that scotch costs **$60 per bottle**, so:

$$
\text{Cost of cognac per bottle} = 60 + (0.5 \times 60) = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars per bottle}
$$

---

### Step 4: Total Cost of Cognac

He buys **20 bottles** at **$90 each**:

$$
20 \times 90 = 1800 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### Step 5: Total Cost of Everything

Add the cost of scotch and cognac:

$$
600 + 1800 = \boxed{2400} \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{2400}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Day 1:**

- Mr. Julius planted **20 White Oak** trees.
- He planted **twice as many Lodgepole Pine** as White Oak.

So, Lodgepole Pine on Day 1 =  
$$
2 \times 20 = 40
$$

**Total trees on Day 1:**  
$$
20 + 40 = 60
$$

---

### **Day 2:**

- He planted **10 more White Oak** trees than on Day 1:  
$$
20 + 10 = 30
$$

- He planted **1/4 more Lodgepole Pine** than on Day 1.  
First, find 1/4 of 40:  
$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
$$

So, Lodgepole Pine on Day 2 =  
$$
40 + 10 = 50
$$

**Total trees on Day 2:**  
$$
30 + 50 = 80
$$

---

### **Total Trees Planted in Two Days:**

$$
60 + 80 = \boxed{140}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **140 trees**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial amount of root beer**
Fred made **24 gallons** of root beer on the first day and put them in the cooler.

---

### **Step 2: First day — Children drank some**
That evening, the children drank **4 gallons**.

So, remaining after Day 1:
$$
24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Second day — Spill**
Barbie accidentally spilled **7 gallons**.

Remaining after Day 2:
$$
20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Third day — Ronnie took some**
Ronnie helped himself to **5 gallons**.

Remaining after Day 3:
$$
13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Fourth day — Party time**
On the fourth day, **3 people** showed up for the party.  
Fred and the others shared the remaining root beer **equally**.

We need to find how much each person got.

Remaining root beer = **8 gallons**

Number of people = **3**

So, each person gets:
$$
\frac{8}{3} \text{ gallons}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\frac{8}{3}} \text{ gallons per person}
$$

Or as a mixed number:
$$
\boxed{2\frac{2}{3}} \text{ gallons per person}
$$
We are given the following statement:

> "Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40."

Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the variable

Let:
- $ x $ = the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge

---

### Step 2: Translate the sentence into an equation

"Four times the number of coffee mugs" means:  
$$
4x
$$

"Eight more than that" means:  
$$
4x + 8
$$

This equals 40, so the equation is:
$$
4x + 8 = 40
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve the equation

Subtract 8 from both sides:
$$
4x = 40 - 8 \\
4x = 32
$$

Now divide both sides by 4:
$$
x = \frac{32}{4} = 8
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{8}
$$

There are **8** coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge.
We are given that there are **66 fish** in the fish tank.

---

### Step 1: Find how many fish have **red stripes**

One-third of the fish have red stripes:

$$
\frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
$$

So, **22 fish have red stripes**.

---

### Step 2: Find how many fish are **left after removing those with red stripes**

$$
66 - 22 = 44
$$

So, **44 fish remain** after removing the ones with red stripes.

---

### Step 3: Find how many of the remaining fish have **blue stripes**

We are told that **5/11** of the remaining fish have blue stripes:

$$
\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20
$$

So, **20 fish have blue stripes**.

---

### Step 4: Find the total number of fish with **red or blue stripes**

We need to be careful here. The question says:

> "Altogether, how many fish have red stripes and blue stripes?"

This is a bit ambiguous, but the most likely interpretation is:

> How many fish have **either** red stripes **or** blue stripes?

That is, we want the **total number of fish with red or blue stripes**, not necessarily both.

So, we add the two groups:

- Fish with red stripes: **22**
- Fish with blue stripes: **20**

But wait — some fish may have **both** red and blue stripes. We don’t know that yet. However, the problem doesn't say anything about overlap (i.e., fish that have both), so we must assume that the groups are **disjoint** unless stated otherwise.

So, we can safely assume that the **22 fish with red stripes** and the **20 fish with blue stripes** are **distinct** groups.

---

### Final Answer:

$$
22 + 20 = \boxed{42}
$$

✅ **Answer: 42 fish have red stripes or blue stripes.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Count the total number of eyeshadow colors Amy originally had

- **Two eyeshadow palettes**, each with **4 colors**:
  $$
  2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ colors}
  $$

- **Three makeup sets**, each with **6 colors**:
  $$
  3 \times 6 = 18 \text{ colors}
  $$

- **Total original eyeshadow colors**:
  $$
  8 + 18 = 26 \text{ colors}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Subtract the stolen palette

- Amy’s sister steals **one palette**, which has **4 colors**.
  $$
  26 - 4 = 22 \text{ colors left}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Subtract the used colors from one makeup set

- Amy uses up **half** of the colors from **one makeup set**.
  - One makeup set has **6 colors**, so half is:
    $$
    \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ colors used}
    $$

- Subtract those from the remaining colors:
  $$
  22 - 3 = 19 \text{ colors left}
  $$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{19}
$$

Amy has **19 eyeshadow colors left**.
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Mattison's height
Mattison is **60 inches** tall.

---

### Step 2: Height of the two-story house
The house is **7 times as high as Mattison**.

So, the total height of the house is:

$$
7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 3: Height from the first floor to the ceiling on the first floor
The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is **3 times as high as Mattison**.

So, the height from the first floor to its ceiling is:

$$
3 \times 60 = 180 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### Step 4: Height from the second floor's floor to the roof
We now need to find how high the **roof is from the second floor’s floor**.

Since the house has **two stories**, and the **first story** goes up to a ceiling that is **180 inches** from the ground (first floor), then the **second floor's floor** is at that same level — **180 inches** above the ground.

Now, the **total height of the house** is **420 inches**, so the height from the **second floor's floor** to the **roof** is:

$$
420 - 180 = 240 \text{ inches}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{240} \text{ inches}
$$
Let's solve this step by step.

### **Total number of shells found:**  
**700**

---

### **Step 1: Shells found by Team Alphas**

Team Alphas found **40%** of the total shells:

$$
\text{Alphas} = 40\% \times 700 = 0.40 \times 700 = 280 \text{ shells}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Remaining shells after Alphas**

$$
\text{Remaining shells} = 700 - 280 = 420 \text{ shells}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Shells found by Team The Finders**

Team The Finders found **60%** of the remaining shells (which is 60% of 420):

$$
\text{Finders} = 60\% \times 420 = 0.60 \times 420 = 252 \text{ shells}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Shells found by Team Gogetters**

Now subtract the shells found by Alphas and Finders from the total to find how many Gogetters found:

$$
\text{Gogetters} = 700 - 280 - 252 = 168 \text{ shells}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
**Team Gogetters found 168 shells.**
We are told that Bernie has **4 dogs**, and each needs a certain amount of exercise per day, in the form of walking miles. We are given:

- Dog 1: 1 mile  
- Dog 2: 4 miles  
- Dog 3: 3 miles  
- Dog 4: **Unknown** (this is what we need to find)  

Also, we're told that **on average**, the dogs need to walk **3 miles per day**.

---

### Step 1: Use the formula for average

The average number of miles walked per dog is calculated as:

$$
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total miles walked by all dogs}}{\text{Number of dogs}}
$$

We are told the average is **3 miles per dog**, and there are **4 dogs**.

So,

$$
3 = \frac{\text{Total miles}}{4}
$$

Multiply both sides by 4:

$$
\text{Total miles} = 3 \times 4 = 12
$$

---

### Step 2: Add up the known miles

We know the first three dogs' walking distances:

- Dog 1: 1 mile  
- Dog 2: 4 miles  
- Dog 3: 3 miles  

Add them:

$$
1 + 4 + 3 = 8 \text{ miles}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the last dog's distance

Let the distance for the last dog be $ x $. Then:

$$
\text{Total miles} = 8 + x = 12
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
x = 12 - 8 = 4
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**The last dog needs to walk 4 miles.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Value of the house**:  
   $250,000

2. **Loan amount (40% of the house value)**:  
   $$
   0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
   $$

3. **Amount used to pay off debts (60% of the loan)**:  
   $$
   0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
   $$

4. **Money left after paying debt**:  
   $$
   100,000 - 60,000 = 40,000
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:  
**$40,000** was left after paying off the debt.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Find the total weight of the tunas
Deandre caught **3 tunas** with the following weights:
- First tuna: **56 kg**
- Second tuna: **46 kg**
- Third tuna: **26 kg**

Add these together to find the **total weight**:

$$
56 + 46 + 26 = 128 \text{ kg}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings
Each kilogram of tuna sells for **$0.50**.

So, total earnings = total weight × price per kilogram:

$$
128 \times 0.50 = 64
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Deandre will earn $64** after selling all the tunas.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the cost price
Trinity **bought** the magazines at **$72**.

### Step 2: Determine the selling price
She sells them at **11/8 of the price she bought them**.  
This means she sells them at:

$$
\text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
$$

Now calculate that:

$$
\frac{11}{8} \times 72 = 11 \times 9 = 99
$$

So, she sells the magazines for **$99**.

### Step 3: Calculate her profit
Profit is calculated as:

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}
$$

$$
\text{Profit} = 99 - 72 = 27
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Her profit is $27.**
Let's break the problem down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the dehumidifier's water removal rates

- **Low setting**: removes **1 liter per day**
- **Medium setting**: removes **twice as much** as low → $2 \times 1 = 2$ liters per day
- **High setting**: removes **twice as much** as medium → $2 \times 2 = 4$ liters per day

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of water removed for each period

- **3 days on low setting**:
  $$
  3 \text{ days} \times 1 \text{ liter/day} = 3 \text{ liters}
  $$

- **3 days on medium setting**:
  $$
  3 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ liters/day} = 6 \text{ liters}
  $$

- **5 days on high setting**:
  $$
  5 \text{ days} \times 4 \text{ liters/day} = 20 \text{ liters}
  $$

### Step 3: Add all the amounts together

$$
3 + 6 + 20 = 29 \text{ liters}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{29} \text{ liters}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

$$
3 \times 14 = 42 \text{ mL}
$$

### Step 2: Total amount per dose
Add the two amounts together for one dose:
$$
14 + 42 = 56 \text{ mL per dose}
$$

### Step 3: Total amount for 8 doses
Multiply the amount per dose by 8:
$$
56 \times 8 = 448 \text{ mL}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{448} \text{ mL}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### Step 1: Determine the capacity of Ali’s class
Ali's class has a capacity of **120 students**.

---

### Step 2: Find the capacity of one of John’s classes
Each of John’s classes has **1/8** the capacity of Ali’s class.

So, the capacity of one of John’s classes is:

$$
\frac{1}{8} \times 120 = 15 \text{ students}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the total capacity of both of John’s classes
John has **2 classes**, each with a capacity of 15 students:

$$
2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ students}
$$

---

### Step 4: Find the combined capacity of both schools
- Ali’s class: **120 students**
- John’s two classes: **30 students**

So, the **combined capacity** is:

$$
120 + 30 = \boxed{150} \text{ students}
$$

---

$$
\boxed{150}
$$
We are given:

- Stephen borrowed **$300** from his sister.
- He promises to return the **full amount with an additional 2% interest**, so he will pay back:
  
  $$
  \text{Total to be paid} = 300 + (2\% \text{ of } 300) = 300 + 6 = \$306
  $$

- He will pay **$25 per month for 11 months**.
- The remaining amount, including the interest, will be paid in the **twelfth month**.

---

### Step 1: Calculate total payments over 11 months

$$
\text{Total paid in 11 months} = 11 \times 25 = \$275
$$

---

### Step 2: Subtract from total amount to find the twelfth month payment

$$
\text{Remaining amount} = 306 - 275 = \$31
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Stephen will pay $31 in the twelfth month.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Number of children**: 2  
2. **Diaper changes per child per day**: 5  
3. **Total diaper changes per day** = Number of children × Diaper changes per child  
   $$
   2 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ changes/child} = 10 \text{ diaper changes per day}
   $$

4. **Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers**:  
   $$
   \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ diaper changes}
   $$

5. **Therefore, Jordan changes the other half**:  
   $$
   10 - 5 = 5 \text{ diaper changes per day}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **5 diapers per day**
We are given the following information:

- **Jar dimensions**: 6 inches by 6 inches base (square), and 15 inches tall.
- **Jelly bean volume**: 0.15 cubic inches per jelly bean.
- **Packing efficiency**: 80% (i.e., only 80% of the jar's volume is occupied by jelly beans).
- **Proportion of red jelly beans**: 30%.
- **True number of red jelly beans**: 900.

We need to determine how far off Tim's guess was from the true number of red jelly beans.

---

### Step 1: Calculate the total volume of the jar

The jar has a square base of 6 inches by 6 inches, and a height of 15 inches.

$$
\text{Volume of jar} = \text{Base area} \times \text{Height} = 6 \times 6 \times 15 = 540 \text{ cubic inches}
$$

---

### Step 2: Calculate the volume occupied by jelly beans

Only 80% of the jar’s volume is filled with jelly beans due to packing inefficiency.

$$
\text{Volume of jelly beans} = 0.8 \times 540 = 432 \text{ cubic inches}
$$

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of jelly beans

Each jelly bean occupies 0.15 cubic inches.

$$
\text{Total jelly beans} = \frac{432}{0.15} = 2880 \text{ jelly beans}
$$

---

### Step 4: Estimate the number of red jelly beans

Tim estimates that 30% of the jelly beans are red.

$$
\text{Estimated red jelly beans} = 0.3 \times 2880 = 864
$$

---

### Step 5: Compare with the true number of red jelly beans

We're told the **true** number of red jelly beans is **900**.

$$
\text{Difference} = 900 - 864 = 36
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Tim was off by 36 red jelly beans.**

So, his estimate was **36 less** than the actual number of red jelly beans.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Initial number of passengers**

The bus starts with **20 people** in Chengli city.

---

### **Step 2: First stop**

At the first stop, **40 people enter** the bus.

So, after the first stop:

$$
\text{Total passengers} = 20 + 40 = 60
$$

---

### **Step 3: Second stop**

At the second station, **3/4 of the total number of people who entered at the first station** entered the bus.

We know that **40 people entered at the first station**, so:

$$
\frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30 \text{ people entered}
$$

Now, add these to the current number of passengers:

$$
\text{Total passengers} = 60 + 30 = 90
$$

---

### **Step 4: Third stop**

At the third station, the **number of passengers doubled**.

$$
\text{New total} = 90 \times 2 = 180
$$

---

### **Step 5: Bus capacity**

The bus has a **capacity of 200 people**.

So, the number of remaining spaces is:

$$
200 - 180 = 20
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{20}
$$

**20 people are required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus.**
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the number of visits**

Pauline visits the museum **3 times a year**.  
She continues visiting for **5 years**, and then for **3 more years** (total of **8 years**).

So, total number of visits:

$$
3 \text{ visits/year} \times 8 \text{ years} = 24 \text{ visits}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the cost per visit before the increase**

The initial cost per visit is:

$$
\$2
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the cost per visit after the increase**

After 5 years, the cost increases by **150%**.

A **150% increase** means the new price is:

$$
\text{New cost} = \text{Original cost} + 150\% \text{ of original cost}
= \$2 + (1.5 \times \$2) = \$2 + \$3 = \$5
$$

So, the cost per visit becomes **\$5** after 5 years.

---

### **Step 4: Determine how many visits were made at each price**

- For the first **5 years**, the cost was **\$2 per visit**.
- For the next **3 years**, the cost was **\$5 per visit**.

Total visits in the first 5 years:

$$
3 \text{ visits/year} \times 5 \text{ years} = 15 \text{ visits}
$$

Total visits in the last 3 years:

$$
3 \text{ visits/year} \times 3 \text{ years} = 9 \text{ visits}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Calculate the total cost**

- Cost for first 15 visits:
$$
15 \text{ visits} \times \$2 = \$30
$$

- Cost for next 9 visits:
$$
9 \text{ visits} \times \$5 = \$45
$$

---

### **Step 6: Total amount spent**

$$
\$30 + \$45 = \boxed{\$75}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$75}
$$
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the total number of students
- There are **4 grades**: 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th.
- Each grade has **10 students** who qualify for the escape room.
- So, total number of students =  
  $$
  4 \text{ grades} \times 10 \text{ students per grade} = 40 \text{ students}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Understand the capacity of the escape room
- Only **8 students** can try the escape room at a time.
- Each group uses **45 minutes** to complete the challenge.

---

### Step 3: Calculate how many groups are needed
To find out how many groups of 8 students are needed to accommodate all 40 students:

$$
\frac{40 \text{ students}}{8 \text{ students per group}} = 5 \text{ groups}
$$

---

### Step 4: Calculate total time required
Each group takes **45 minutes**, and there are **5 groups**.

$$
5 \text{ groups} \times 45 \text{ minutes per group} = 225 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{225 \text{ minutes}}
$$

So, it will take **225 minutes** for everyone to try the escape room if every group uses their full 45 minutes.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Cost of wooden tables:**  
   John made 4 tables, each costing $20.  
   So, the total cost for the tables is:  
   $$
   4 \times 20 = 80
   $$

2. **Cost of roof frames:**  
   John made 2 roof frames, each costing $10.  
   So, the total cost for the roof frames is:  
   $$
   2 \times 10 = 20
   $$

3. **Total amount Ali has to pay:**  
   Add the cost of the tables and the roof frames:  
   $$
   80 + 20 = 100
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **Ali has to pay John $100.**
We are told that:

- The total length of the board is **40 feet**.
- Ian makes a cut to form **two pieces**.
- The **longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece**.

---

### Step 1: Define variables

Let:
- $ x $ = length of the **shorter piece**
- Then, the **longer piece** = $ 4x $

---

### Step 2: Set up the equation

The total length of both pieces is 40 feet:

$$
x + 4x = 40
$$

$$
5x = 40
$$

---

### Step 3: Solve for $ x $

$$
x = \frac{40}{5} = 8
$$

So the **shorter piece** is **8 feet**, and the **longer piece** is:

$$
4x = 4 \times 8 = 32
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**The longer piece is 32 feet long.**
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine how many pounds of meat Aiden needs**

He makes **16 meatballs** from **1 pound** of ground beef.

He wants to make **80 meatballs**.

So, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

$$
\text{Pounds of meat} = \frac{80}{16} = 5
$$

So, Aiden needs **5 pounds** of ground beef.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how much seasoning he needs**

He uses **2 tablespoons of seasoning per pound** of meat.

So for **5 pounds**, he needs:

$$
\text{Seasoning needed} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
$$

---

$$
\text{Total width} = 5 \times 35 = 175 \text{ inches}
$$

### Step 2: Luke needs fabric equal to **2 times** the total width

$$
\text{Fabric needed} = 2 \times 175 = 350 \text{ inches}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Luke should buy **350 inches** of fabric.
Let's break the problem down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the pricing structure**

- **First 16 minutes:** $0.25 per minute  
- **After 16 minutes (i.e., from minute 17 onward):** $0.20 per minute

---

### **Step 2: Calculate cost for the first 16 minutes**

$$
\text{Cost for first 16 minutes} = 16 \times 0.25 = 4.00
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate cost for the remaining minutes**

Total call duration = 36 minutes  
Minutes after the first 16 = $36 - 16 = 20$ minutes

$$
\text{Cost for remaining 20 minutes} = 20 \times 0.20 = 4.00
$$

---

### **Step 4: Add both costs together**

$$
\text{Total cost} = 4.00 + 4.00 = 8.00
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$8.00}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Rain on Monday**:  
   It rained **2 inches** on Monday.

2. **Rain on Tuesday**:  
   The problem says it is expected to rain **1 more inch than twice** of Monday’s total.  
   So, we first calculate **twice** Monday’s total:  
   $$
   2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ inches}
   $$

3. Now, add **1 more inch** to that amount:  
   $$
   4 + 1 = 5 \text{ inches}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **5 inches** of rain are expected on Tuesday.
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### Step 1: Define the variables

Let:
- $ c $ = number of **cupcakes**
- $ b $ = number of **brownies**

---

### Step 2: Translate the sentence into an equation

> "She makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes."

This means:

$$
b = 3c - 2
$$

---

### Step 3: Total number of treats

Each of the **5 people** gets **2 treats**, so total treats needed is:

$$
5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ treats}
$$

So, the total number of cupcakes and brownies combined must be 10:

$$
c + b = 10
$$

---

### Step 4: Substitute the expression for $ b $

We already have:

$$
b = 3c - 2
$$

Substitute into the total treats equation:

$$
c + (3c - 2) = 10
$$

Simplify:

$$
4c - 2 = 10
$$

Add 2 to both sides:

$$
4c = 12
$$

Divide both sides by 4:

$$
c = 3
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Carly made 3 cupcakes.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### 1. **Base Prices:**
- **Manicure:** $35  
- **Pedicure:** $40  

Karen is getting **both**, so the base cost before any discounts is:
$$
35 + 40 = 75 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### 2. **Discount for Both Services:**
The salon offers a **20% discount** if you get both a manicure and a pedicure.

So, the discount amount is:
$$
20\% \text{ of } 75 = 0.20 \times 75 = 15 \text{ dollars}
$$

Subtracting the discount from the total:
$$
75 - 15 = 60 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### 3. **Nail Art Cost:**
Karen wants to add **nail art on each of her fingers**, at **$3 per nail**.

There are **10 fingers** on two hands, so:
$$
10 \text{ nails} \times 3 = 30 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### 4. **Total Cost:**
Now, add the discounted service cost and the nail art cost:
$$
60 + 30 = 90 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Karen would pay $90 in total.**
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand what is being asked

We are told:

- Susan orders **3 magazines** that send **12 issues a year**.
- She has **1 magazine** that sends **6 issues a year**.
- Her **last magazine** sends her **4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine**.

We are asked:  
**How many magazines does she get every year?**

Wait — this wording might be confusing. Let’s clarify:

The question asks **how many magazines** she gets every year, not how many **issues** she receives.

So we need to count how many **magazines** she has in total.

---

### Step 2: Count the number of magazines

From the problem:

- She has **3 magazines** that send **12 issues a year**.
- She has **1 magazine** that sends **6 issues a year**.
- She has **1 more magazine** (the "last" one) that sends **4 times the amount of the 6-issue magazine**.

So total number of magazines =  
**3 + 1 + 1 = 5**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Susan gets 5 magazines every year.**
We are given the following information:

- Samantha has **12 fewer paintings** than Shelley.
- Shelley has **8 more paintings** than Kim.
- Samantha has **27 paintings**.

We need to find how many paintings **Kim** has.

---

### Step 1: Let’s define variables

Let:
- $ S $ = number of paintings **Samantha** has  
- $ Sh $ = number of paintings **Shelley** has  
- $ K $ = number of paintings **Kim** has  

From the problem:

- $ S = 27 $ (given)
- $ S = Sh - 12 $ → So, $ Sh = S + 12 $
- $ Sh = K + 8 $ → So, $ K = Sh - 8 $

---

### Step 2: Plug in the value of $ S $

Since $ S = 27 $, we can find $ Sh $:

$$
Sh = S + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39
$$

Now use that to find $ K $:

$$
K = Sh - 8 = 39 - 8 = 31
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Kim has 31 paintings.**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Initial price in November
The original price of the toy is:
$$
\$40
$$

---

### Step 2: Price increase in December (80% increase)

An 80% increase means we add 80% of \$40 to the original price.

$$
\text{Increase} = 0.80 \times 40 = 32
$$

$$
\text{New price in December} = 40 + 32 = \$72
$$

---

### Step 3: Price decrease in January (50% decrease)

A 50% decrease means we take half of the December price and subtract it from the price.

$$
\text{Decrease} = 0.50 \times 72 = 36
$$

$$
\text{Final price in January} = 72 - 36 = \$36
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$36}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Standard rate per hour:**  
Charlie charges **$80 per hour** for lessons.

### 2. **Discount for veterans:**  
He reduces his rate by **25%** when teaching a veteran.  
So, the rate for veteran lessons is:  
$$
80 - (0.25 \times 80) = 80 - 20 = 60 \text{ dollars per hour}
$$

### 3. **Number of lessons:**
- **4 lessons at standard rate:**  
  Each is $80, so total for these is:  
  $$
  4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars}
  $$

- **2 lessons with a veteran:**  
  Each is $60, so total for these is:  
  $$
  2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars}
  $$

### 4. **Total earnings for the day:**
$$
320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **$440**
To find **Sally's mean score**, we follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Add all the scores together**

Sally's scores are:  
**50, 80, 80, 60, 40, 90, 100, 70, and 60**

Let’s add them:

$$
50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = ?
$$

Add step by step:

- 50 + 80 = 130  
- 130 + 80 = 210  
- 210 + 60 = 270  
- 270 + 40 = 310  
- 310 + 90 = 400  
- 400 + 100 = 500  
- 500 + 70 = 570  
- 570 + 60 = **630**

So, the **sum of the scores is 630**.

---

### **Step 2: Count the number of scores**

There are **9** scores in total.

---

### **Step 3: Divide the sum by the number of scores**

$$
\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of scores}}{\text{Number of scores}} = \frac{630}{9}
$$

$$
\frac{630}{9} = 70
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Sally's mean score is 70.**
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the original amount
Eve originally had **20 pieces of pomelos**.

### Step 2: Determine how many she is left with
She is left with **1/4** of the pomelos she originally had.

So, we calculate:

$$
\frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
$$

Eve is left with **5 pomelos**.

### Step 3: Find out how many she gave away
To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, subtract the number she has left from the original amount:

$$
20 - 5 = 15
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Eve gave away 15 pomelos.**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Total apples Walter bought
Walter bought **60 apples**.

---

### Step 2: Apples Walter ate
He ate **2/5** of the apples:

$$
\frac{2}{5} \times 60 = 24 \text{ apples}
$$

So, he ate **24 apples**.

---

### Step 3: Remaining apples after eating
$$
60 - 24 = 36 \text{ apples remaining}
$$

---

### Step 4: Apples given to his sister
He gave **25%** of the remaining apples to his sister:

$$
25\% \times 36 = 0.25 \times 36 = 9 \text{ apples}
$$

So, he gave **9 apples** to his sister.

---

### Step 5: Apples left after giving to sister
$$
36 - 9 = 27 \text{ apples}
$$

---

### Step 6: Money received from selling apples
He sold the remaining **27 apples** at **$3 each**:

$$
27 \times 3 = 81
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$81}
$$

Walter received **\$81** from selling the apples.
We are told that Regina wrote **9 novels last year**, and this is **3 quarters (or 3/4)** of the number of novels she has written **this year**.

Let’s call the number of novels she wrote **this year** = $ x $.

We are given:

$$
\frac{3}{4}x = 9
$$

### Step 1: Solve for $ x $

Multiply both sides of the equation by $ \frac{4}{3} $ to isolate $ x $:

$$
x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3}
$$

$$
x = \frac{36}{3} = 12
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Regina has written 12 novels this year.**
Let's break this down step by step to find what percentage of the distance between Alaska and Texas Michael has covered.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the given information**

- **Michael's average speed:** 50 km/hr  
- **Time traveled:** 3 days  
- **Distance between Alaska and Texas:** 6000 km  
- **We need to find:** What percentage of 6000 km has Michael covered?

---

### **Step 2: Convert time into hours**

Since Michael is traveling for **3 days**, we need to convert that into **hours**:

$$
3 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = 72 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled**

Now, use the formula:

$$
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
$$

$$
\text{Distance} = 50 \text{ km/hr} \times 72 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ km}
$$

So, Michael has traveled **3600 km**.

---

### **Step 4: Find the percentage of the total distance (Alaska to Texas)**

The total distance is **6000 km**, so we calculate:

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance Traveled}}{\text{Total Distance}} \right) \times 100
$$

$$
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{3600}{6000} \right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\%
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

**Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Grapes eaten by Madeline  
Madeline ate **6 grapes**.

---

### Step 2: Grapes used by her brother  
Her brother used **5 times as many grapes** as Madeline to make grape juice.  
So:

$$
\text{Grapes used by brother} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ grapes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total grapes used so far  
So far, the total number of grapes used is:

$$
6 \text{ (Madeline)} + 30 \text{ (Brother)} = 36 \text{ grapes}
$$

---

### Step 4: Grapes used for pies  
Their mother used the **remaining grapes** to make **4 pies**, and each pie requires **12 grapes**.

$$
\text{Grapes used for pies} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ grapes}
$$

---

### Step 5: Total grapes at the beginning  
To find the original number of grapes, we add up all the grapes used:

$$
\text{Total grapes} = 6 \text{ (Madeline)} + 30 \text{ (Brother)} + 48 \text{ (Pies)} = 84 \text{ grapes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{84} \text{ grapes}
$$

  $ 69 + 9 = 78 $

### ✅ Final Answer: **78 teachers were at school that day.**
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Bud spends on making macaroni and cheese in one year.

---

### **1. Weekly Cost Breakdown**

- **Pasta:** $1.00 per box  
- **Cheddar Cheese:** $3.00  
- **Gruyère Cheese:** Twice the cost of cheddar = 2 × $3.00 = **$6.00**

So, total weekly cost is:

$$
\$1.00 + \$3.00 + \$6.00 = \$10.00 \text{ per week}
$$

---

### **2. Annual Cost Calculation**

There are 52 weeks in a year, so:

$$
\$10.00 \times 52 = \$520.00
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Bud spends \$520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.**
Let's break this down step by step to find the **percentage of their day** that the custodian spends cleaning classrooms.

---

### **Step 1: Total time spent cleaning classrooms**

- There are **80 classrooms**.
- It takes **15 minutes per classroom** to clean.
  
$$
\text{Total cleaning time} = 80 \times 15 = 1200 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Convert total cleaning time to hours**

$$
1200 \text{ minutes} = \frac{1200}{60} = 20 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Total time available in a work week (5 days)**

- The custodian works **8 hours per day** for **5 days**.

$$
\text{Total work time} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \text{ hours}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning**

We want to know what **percentage of the total work time** is used for cleaning:

$$
\text{Percentage of time spent cleaning} = \left( \frac{\text{Cleaning time}}{\text{Total work time}} \right) \times 100
$$

$$
= \left( \frac{20}{40} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{50\%}
$$

So, on average, the custodian spends **50% of their day** cleaning classrooms.
Let's break the problem down step by step to find out how many bookcases Elly needs to hold all 110 books.

---

### Step 1: Understand the capacity of each shelf

We are told:

- **Middle shelves**: There are **2 middle shelves**, and **each can hold 10 books**.
- **Bottom shelf**: Can hold **twice as many books as a middle shelf** → $ 2 \times 10 = 20 $ books
- **Top shelf**: Can hold **5 fewer books than the bottom shelf** → $ 20 - 5 = 15 $ books

So, the total number of books that one bookcase can hold is:

$$
\text{Total per bookcase} = (\text{Middle shelves}) + (\text{Bottom shelf}) + (\text{Top shelf})
$$
$$
= (2 \times 10) + 20 + 15 = 20 + 20 + 15 = 55 \text{ books}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine how many bookcases are needed

Elly has **110 books**, and each bookcase holds **55 books**.

$$
\text{Number of bookcases needed} = \frac{110}{55} = 2
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{2}
$$

Elly needs **2 bookcases** to hold all 110 books.
Let's break this problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the eggs**

Rose bought **five dozens** of eggs at **$2.40 per dozen**.

$$
\text{Total cost} = 5 \text{ dozen} \times \$2.40/\text{dozen} = \$12.00
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate how many eggs Rose has**

Each dozen has **12 eggs**, so:

$$
\text{Total eggs} = 5 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ eggs/dozen} = 60 \text{ eggs}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how much Rose sells each egg for**

She sells **3 eggs for $1**, so:

$$
\text{Price per egg} = \frac{\$1}{3} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ dollars per egg}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Calculate total revenue from selling all eggs**

$$
\text{Revenue} = 60 \text{ eggs} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ dollars/egg} = 20 \text{ dollars}
$$

---

### **Step 5: Calculate profit**

$$
\text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} = \$20 - \$12 = \$8
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{\$8}
$$
Let's break the problem down step by step.

Skyler has **100 hats** in total. The hats are colored **red**, **blue**, and **white**.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of red hats

We're told that **half** of the hats are red:

$$
\text{Red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
$$

So, there are **50 red hats**.

---

### Step 2: Find the number of blue hats

Now, we're told that **3/5 of the remaining hats** are blue.

The "remaining hats" refer to the hats that are **not red**, which is:

$$
100 - 50 = 50
$$

So, the number of blue hats is:

$$
\text{Blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
$$

So, there are **30 blue hats**.

---

### Step 3: Find the number of white hats

Now, subtract the number of red and blue hats from the total to find the number of white hats:

$$
\text{White hats} = 100 - 50 - 30 = 20
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{20}
$$

Skyler has **20 white hats**.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the original price
- A bag of beef jerky costs **$18.00**.
- Archie buys **1 bag**, but it’s **$3.00 off**.

### Step 2: Calculate the discounted price
- Discounted price = $18.00 - $3.00 = **$15.00**

### Step 3: Determine how many sticks are in a bag
- Each bag contains **30 sticks**.

### Step 4: Find the cost per stick in dollars
- Cost per stick = Total cost ÷ Number of sticks  
  = $15.00 ÷ 30 sticks  
  = **$0.50 per stick**

### Step 5: Convert to cents
- $0.50 = **50 cents**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the goal**

Audrey needs to correctly answer **70% of all questions** on both tests combined to pass.

---

### **Step 2: Determine total number of questions**

- First test: 70 questions  
- Second test: 40 questions  
- **Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions**

---

### **Step 3: Find how many questions she needs to answer correctly in total**

She needs to get **70% of 110 questions correct**:

$$
\text{Correct answers needed} = 0.70 \times 110 = 77
$$

So, Audrey needs to get **77 questions correct** in total across both tests.

---

### **Step 4: How many did she get right on the first test?**

She got **60% of 70 questions correct**:

$$
\text{Correct on first test} = 0.60 \times 70 = 42
$$

---

### **Step 5: How many does she need to get right on the second test?**

She already got 42 correct on the first test, so she needs:

$$
\text{Correct on second test} = 77 - 42 = 35
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Audrey needs to get **35 questions right** on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.
We are given:

- Mary makes **strawberry cubes** and **blueberry cubes**.
- The number of **blueberry cubes** is **5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4**.
- The **total number of ice cubes** is **116**.

Let’s define:

- Let $ s $ be the number of **strawberry cubes**.
- Then the number of **blueberry cubes** is $ 5s - 4 $ (from the problem statement).

### Step 1: Write the total number of cubes
$$
\text{Total cubes} = \text{Strawberry cubes} + \text{Blueberry cubes}
$$
$$
s + (5s - 4) = 116
$$

### Step 2: Simplify the equation
$$
s + 5s - 4 = 116
$$
$$
6s - 4 = 116
$$

### Step 3: Solve for $ s $
Add 4 to both sides:
$$
6s = 120
$$

Divide by 6:
$$
s = 20
$$

So, Mary made **20 strawberry cubes**.

### Step 4: Find the number of blueberry cubes
$$
\text{Blueberry cubes} = 5s - 4 = 5(20) - 4 = 100 - 4 = 96
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
Mary makes **96 blueberry cubes**.

   40 \text{ games/year} \times 21 \text{ points/game} = 840 \text{ points/year}
   $$

4. **Total points over four years**:  
   $$
   840 \text{ points/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 3,360 \text{ points}
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **3,360 points**
Let's go through the problem step by step to figure out how many marbles Brendan ended up with.

---

### **Step 1: Initial number of marbles**
Brendan starts with:
- **10 marbles**

---

### **Step 2: He drops half of them**
He drops:
- $ \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 $ marbles

So, he has:
- $ 10 - 5 = 5 $ marbles left

---

### **Step 3: He searches and finds 3 marbles**
He finds:
- **3 marbles**

So, now he has:
- $ 5 + 3 = 8 $ marbles

---

### **Step 4: He finds one that is not a marble**
He finds **one** object that is **not** a marble — it's a **bead**.

So, he gets rid of it:
- $ 8 - 1 = 7 $ marbles

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Brendan ends up with 7 marbles.**
Let's break this down step by step to figure out how many **telephone calls** Jason needs to make in order to **sell 15 cars** and earn his bonus.

---

### Step 1: Understand the conversion rates

From the problem:

- **For every 25 telephone calls**, Jason gets **1 customer** to come into the dealership.
- **For every 2 customers** that come in, **1 customer buys a car**.

So we can write these as ratios:

- **Calls to Customers:**  
  $ \frac{1 \text{ customer}}{25 \text{ calls}} $

- **Customers to Sales:**  
  $ \frac{1 \text{ sale}}{2 \text{ customers}} $

---

### Step 2: Combine the ratios to find calls per sale

We want to find out how many **calls** are needed for **1 sale**.

Start with the ratio of **calls to customers**:
$$
\frac{1 \text{ customer}}{25 \text{ calls}}
$$

Then use the ratio of **customers to sales**:
$$
\frac{1 \text{ sale}}{2 \text{ customers}}
$$

Now combine them:
$$
\frac{1 \text{ sale}}{2 \text{ customers}} \times \frac{25 \text{ calls}}{1 \text{ customer}} = \frac{25}{2} \text{ calls per sale}
$$

So, **Jason needs 12.5 calls per sale**.

---

### Step 3: Multiply by the number of sales needed (15)

$$
15 \text{ sales} \times 12.5 \text{ calls per sale} = 187.5 \text{ calls}
$$

Since you can't make half a call, Jason would need to make **at least 188 calls** to ensure he sells **15 cars**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jason needs to make 188 telephone calls** to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus.
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many **candles and flashlights** Brianna's family is using when the lights go out.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the number of flashlights**

We are told:

- There are **4 people** in the house.
- Each person has **one flashlight** to carry.
- Additionally, there are **two flashlights for each room**.

There are **8 rooms** in the house.

#### Flashlights carried by people:
$$
4 \text{ people} \times 1 \text{ flashlight/person} = 4 \text{ flashlights}
$$

#### Flashlights per room:
$$
8 \text{ rooms} \times 2 \text{ flashlights/room} = 16 \text{ flashlights}
$$

#### Total number of flashlights:
$$
4 + 16 = 20 \text{ flashlights}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine the number of candles**

We are told:

- There are **4 small candles**, each for **half the rooms**.
- There are **5 medium candles**, each for the **other half of the rooms**.

First, divide the 8 rooms into two halves:

- Half the rooms = $ \frac{8}{2} = 4 $ rooms

So:

- **Small candles**: 4 small candles, one for each of the first 4 rooms.
- **Medium candles**: 5 medium candles, one for each of the other 4 rooms.

Total number of candles:

$$
4 \text{ (small)} + 5 \text{ (medium)} = 9 \text{ candles}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Add up all items**

- **Flashlights**: 20
- **Candles**: 9

$$
\text{Total items} = 20 + 9 = \boxed{29}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{29}
$$

Brianna's family is using **29 candles and flashlights** in total when the lights go out.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Total number of chips:**
   Mitchell buys **2 bags** of chips, and each bag has **55 chips**.
   $$
   2 \times 55 = 110 \text{ chips}
   $$

2. **Number of family members:**
   There are **5 family members**.

3. **Chips per person:**
   To find how many chips each person gets if they all get the same number, divide the total number of chips by the number of family members:
   $$
   \frac{110}{5} = 22
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer:
Each person gets **22 chips**.
Let's break down the problem step by step and calculate the total time it takes John to solve the Rubik's cube.

---

### Step 1: Understand the time for each side

We are told:

- **First side** takes **5 minutes**
- **Second and third sides** each take **twice that long**, so:
  - Second side = 2 × 5 = **10 minutes**
  - Third side = 2 × 5 = **10 minutes**
- **Last 2 sides** (fourth and fifth) each take **half as long as the first**, so:
  - Fourth side = ½ × 5 = **2.5 minutes**
  - Fifth side = ½ × 5 = **2.5 minutes**

Now, we have all six sides accounted for:

| Side | Time (minutes) |
|------|----------------|
| 1    | 5              |
| 2    | 10             |
| 3    | 10             |
| 4    | 2.5            |
| 5    | 2.5            |
| 6    | ?              |

Wait! The problem says:

> "Once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides."

So that means **the 6th side is already included in the 5th side**, or that the **fifth side includes the sixth** — which is a bit confusing.

But let's re-read the full statement carefully:

> "It takes John 5 minutes to get to the first side of the Rubik's cube. The second and third sides each take twice that long. The last 2 sides each take half as long as the first, and once you get the 5th side you have all 6 sides."

This suggests that the **last two sides (i.e., the 4th and 5th)** each take half as long as the first (5 minutes), and **once you complete the 5th side**, you've completed **all 6 sides**.

So the **6th side is part of the 5th side** — meaning the **5th side includes the 6th side**.

Therefore, we only need to sum the times for **sides 1 through 5**, because completing the 5th side gives us all 6 sides.

---

### Step 2: Add up the times

- Side 1: 5 minutes  
- Side 2: 10 minutes  
- Side 3: 10 minutes  
- Side 4: 2.5 minutes  
- Side 5: 2.5 minutes  

Now add them:

$$
5 + 10 + 10 + 2.5 + 2.5 = 30 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**The Rubik's cube takes 30 minutes to solve.**
Let's break down the problem step by step.

---

### Given:
- Dominick saw **half as many robots as helmets**.
- He also saw **half as many helmets as footballs**.
- There were **20 helmets**.

---

### Step 1: Find the number of robots

We are told that there are **half as many robots as helmets**.

So:

$$
\text{Number of robots} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of helmets}
$$

$$
\text{Number of robots} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the number of footballs

We are told that there are **half as many helmets as footballs**, which means:

$$
\text{Number of helmets} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of footballs}
$$

We know there are 20 helmets, so:

$$
20 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of footballs}
$$

Multiply both sides by 2:

$$
\text{Number of footballs} = 40
$$

---

### Step 3: Total number of items

Now, we add up all the items:

- Helmets = 20  
- Robots = 10  
- Footballs = 40  

$$
\text{Total items} = 20 + 10 + 40 = \boxed{70}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{70}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Time spent at work per day:**
Tim spends **6 hours** each day at work.

### 2. **Convert hours to minutes:**
Since there are **60 minutes in an hour**, we can convert the daily time to minutes:

$$
6 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes/day}
$$

### 3. **Time per call:**
Each call takes **15 minutes**.

### 4. **Number of calls per day:**
To find how many calls Tim handles in one day, divide the total minutes he works by the time per call:

$$
\frac{360 \text{ minutes/day}}{15 \text{ minutes/call}} = 24 \text{ calls/day}
$$

### 5. **Number of calls in a 5-day work week:**
Now multiply the number of calls per day by the number of work days:

$$
24 \text{ calls/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 120 \text{ calls}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Tim deals with 120 calls during his 5-day work week.**
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the drying time per painting**

$$
6 \text{ paintings} \times 7 \text{ minutes/painting} = 42 \text{ minutes}
$$

#### With the **new varnish**:
$$
6 \text{ paintings} \times 12 \text{ minutes/painting} = 72 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Find the difference in drying time**

$$
72 \text{ minutes (new)} - 42 \text{ minutes (old)} = 30 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**It will take 30 minutes longer** with the new varnish to dry the coat of varnish on 6 paintings.
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Total number of plants
Crista has **20 plants** in total.

### Step 2: Number of plants needing different amounts of water
- **4 plants** need **½ cup** of water each.
- **8 plants** need **1 cup** of water each.
- The **rest** need **¼ cup** of water each.

First, find how many plants are left after accounting for the first two groups:

$$
20 - 4 - 8 = 8 \text{ plants}
$$

So, **8 plants** need **¼ cup** of water each.

---

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water needed

#### For the 4 plants that need ½ cup:
$$
4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2 \text{ cups}
$$

#### For the 8 plants that need 1 cup:
$$
8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ cups}
$$

#### For the 8 plants that need ¼ cup:
$$
8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### Step 4: Add them all together

$$
2 + 8 + 2 = 12 \text{ cups}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.**
We are given the following information:

- **Total distance** Phineas needs to travel: **200 yards**
- **Half of the distance is on land**, so:
  - **Land distance** = $ \frac{200}{2} = 100 $ yards
  - **Water distance** = $ \frac{200}{2} = 100 $ yards
- **Speed on land**: 20 yards per minute  
- **Speed in water**: 10 yards per minute

---

### Step 1: Time on land
$$
\text{Time on land} = \frac{\text{Distance on land}}{\text{Speed on land}} = \frac{100}{20} = 5 \text{ minutes}
$$

### Step 2: Time in water
$$
\text{Time in water} = \frac{\text{Distance in water}}{\text{Speed in water}} = \frac{100}{10} = 10 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### Step 3: Total time
$$
\text{Total time} = \text{Time on land} + \text{Time in water} = 5 + 10 = \boxed{15} \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **15 minutes**
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Determine how many boxes Bob needs
Bob needs **56 popsicle sticks**, and each box contains **8 popsicle sticks**.

So, we divide:

$$
\frac{56}{8} = 7 \text{ boxes}
$$

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost
Each box costs **$2.00**, so:

$$
7 \text{ boxes} \times \$2.00 \text{ per box} = \$14.00
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
**It will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand the information

- There are **5 phones** in total.
- The **main phone** costs **twice as much** as each **additional phone**.
- The **main phone plan** (which includes the main phone and possibly other services) costs **$20**.
- We are asked to find the **total cost of the whole phone plan**, which includes all 5 phones.

---

### Step 2: Define variables

Let’s define:

- Let the cost of **one additional phone** be **x**.
- Then, the cost of the **main phone** is **2x** (since it costs twice as much as an additional phone).

So:
- Main phone = $2x$
- Each additional phone = $x$

There are **5 phones total**. That means:
- 1 main phone
- 4 additional phones

---

### Step 3: Write the equation for the total cost

Total cost = Cost of main phone + Cost of 4 additional phones  
$$
\text{Total cost} = 2x + 4x = 6x
$$

We are told that the **main phone plan costs $20**, which includes the **main phone** and possibly other services. However, the problem seems to imply that the **$20 is just the cost of the main phone**, not the entire plan.

But let's double-check the wording:

> "The main phone plan costs $20"

This is a bit ambiguous, but based on the rest of the question, it likely means that the **main phone itself costs $20**.

If the **main phone costs $20**, then:

- Main phone = $20
- So, from earlier, we had:  
  Main phone = $2x$  
  → $2x = 20$  
  → $x = 10$

Now we can calculate the total cost of all 5 phones:

- Main phone = $20  
- 4 additional phones = $4 × $10 = $40

---

### Step 4: Add them up

$$
\text{Total cost} = 20 + 40 = \boxed{60}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{\$60}
$$
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Determine how many doughnuts Derrick makes each day:**
- He makes **10 dozen** doughnuts per day.
- 1 dozen = 12 doughnuts  
→ So, 10 dozen = $10 \times 12 = 120$ doughnuts per day.

### 2. **Find out how much he earns per day:**
- Each doughnut is sold for **$2**.
→ So, daily earnings = $120 \text{ doughnuts} \times \$2/\text{doughnut} = \$240$

### 3. **Calculate how many days are in June:**
- June has **30 days**.

### 4. **Calculate total earnings for June:**
- Total earnings = Daily earnings × Number of days  
→ Total earnings = $ \$240 \times 30 = \$7,200 $

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Derrick makes \$7,200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Total number of photos
Jade has taken **210 photos**.

---

### Step 2: Photos uploaded per batch
She uploads **7 photos in one batch**.

---

### Step 3: Batches uploaded per day
She uploads **6 batches each day**.

---

### Step 4: Photos uploaded per day
To find how many photos she uploads in a day, multiply the number of photos per batch by the number of batches per day:

$$
7 \text{ photos/batch} \times 6 \text{ batches/day} = 42 \text{ photos/day}
$$

---

### Step 5: Total days needed to upload all photos
Now divide the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day:

$$
\frac{210 \text{ photos}}{42 \text{ photos/day}} = 5 \text{ days}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Jade will need 5 days to upload all her photos.**
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.

---

### **Step 1: Determine the cost per week**

Alicia drops off the following items each week:

- **Blouses:** 5 blouses × $5.00 = **$25.00**
- **Pants:** 2 pants × $8.00 = **$16.00**
- **Skirt:** 1 skirt × $6.00 = **$6.00**

**Total cost per week = $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00**

---

### **Step 2: Multiply by the number of weeks**

She does this for **5 weeks**, so:

**Total cost for 5 weeks = 5 × $47.00 = $235.00**

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

**Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.**
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Determine John's speaking speed**

- **Normal speaking speed:** 150 words per minute (WPM)
- **After training, he speaks 2.5 times faster**:

$$
\text{Speed after training} = 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \text{ WPM}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Calculate total number of words in 10 pages**

- Each page has **450 words**
- So, for **10 pages**:

$$
\text{Total words} = 10 \times 450 = 4500 \text{ words}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate time to speak 4500 words at 375 WPM**

$$
\text{Time (in minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total words}}{\text{Words per minute}} = \frac{4500}{375} = 12 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**It would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages.**
Let's break this down step by step to find the **total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week**.

---

### Step 1: First day
- **Day 1**: 50 people

---

### Step 2: Second day
- **Day 2**: 20 more people than Day 1  
  So,  
  $$
  \text{Day 2} = 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ people}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Third day
- **Day 3**: Twice the number of people on Day 2  
  So,  
  $$
  \text{Day 3} = 2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ people}
  $$

---

### Step 4: Remaining days (Days 4–7)
- The problem says Conor saw an **average of 60 people per day** for the rest of the week.
- There are **4 days left** (Days 4 through 7).
- So, total number of people on Days 4–7 is:
  $$
  4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ people}
  $$

---

### Step 5: Total number of people for the entire week
Now add up all the people from each day:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Total} &= \text{Day 1} + \text{Day 2} + \text{Day 3} + \text{Days 4–7} \\
&= 50 + 70 + 140 + 240 \\
&= 500 \text{ people}
\end{align*}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{500}
$$

Conor saw a total of **500 people** at the beach that week.
Let's break the problem down step by step and calculate how many kernels popped in each 30-second interval, then add them up to find the total number of popcorn pieces Garrett has to eat.

---

### Step 1: Define the initial rate

We are told:

- **First 30 seconds**: 20 kernels pop  
  So, **initial popping rate** = 20 kernels per 30 seconds

---

### Step 2: Next 30 seconds

- **Next 30 seconds**: 3 times the initial rate  
  $$
  3 \times 20 = 60 \text{ kernels}
  $$

---

### Step 3: Next 30 seconds

- **Next 30 seconds**: 4 times the initial rate  
  $$
  4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ kernels}
  $$

---

### Step 4: Final 30 seconds

- **Final 30 seconds**: Half the rate of the previous 30 seconds  
  The previous rate was 80 kernels per 30 seconds  
  $$
  \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40 \text{ kernels}
  $$

---

### Step 5: After turning off the heat

- A quarter of the kernels that popped in the final 30 seconds also pop due to residual heat  
  $$
  \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ kernels}
  $$

---

### Step 6: Total number of popcorn kernels

Now, let's sum all the kernels that popped:

- First 30 seconds: 20  
- Next 30 seconds: 60  
- Next 30 seconds: 80  
- Final 30 seconds: 40  
- Residual heat (after turning off): 10  

$$
\text{Total} = 20 + 60 + 80 + 40 + 10 = \boxed{210}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**Garrett has 210 pieces of popcorn to eat.**
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the recipe**
- For **1 gallon** of lemonade, Tim uses **1 cup of fresh lemon juice**.
- He found that **6 lemons = 1 cup of juice**.

So, to make **1 gallon** of lemonade:
- You need **6 lemons** (since 1 cup of juice = 6 lemons).

---

### **Step 2: How many gallons does Tim want to make?**

- Tim wants to make **4 gallons** of lemonade for the party.
- That means he needs:
  $$
  4 \text{ gallons} \times 6 \text{ lemons per gallon} = 24 \text{ lemons}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Allen wants an extra gallon that is twice as tart**

- "Twice as tart" means using **twice as much lemon juice** in that gallon.
- Normally, 1 gallon requires **1 cup of lemon juice**, so this gallon will need:
  $$
  1 \text{ cup} \times 2 = 2 \text{ cups of lemon juice}
  $$
- Since 6 lemons = 1 cup of juice, then:
  $$
  2 \text{ cups} \times 6 \text{ lemons per cup} = 12 \text{ lemons}
  $$

---

### **Step 4: Total number of lemons needed**

- Regular lemonade: **24 lemons**
- Extra tart gallon: **12 lemons**

$$
\text{Total lemons} = 24 + 12 = \boxed{36}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer: 36 lemons**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the daily food consumption for each breed

- **German Shepherds:**  
  Each German Shepherd eats **5 kg** per day.  
  There are **3** German Shepherds.  
  So, total food for German Shepherds per day =  
  $ 3 \times 5 = 15 $ kg/day

- **Bulldogs:**  
  Each Bulldog eats **3 kg** per day.  
  There are **2** Bulldogs.  
  So, total food for Bulldogs per day =  
  $ 2 \times 3 = 6 $ kg/day

### Step 2: Total daily food consumption

Add the food for both breeds:  
$ 15 + 6 = 21 $ kg/day

### Step 3: Total weekly food consumption

There are **7 days** in a week, so:  
$ 21 \times 7 = 147 $ kg/week

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**147 kilograms of dog food** will be needed in a week.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Count the total number of legs
- **2-legged animals**:  
  There are 10 animals, each with 2 legs.  
  Total legs from 2-legged animals = $10 \times 2 = 20$ legs.

- **4-legged animals**:  
  There are 15 animals, each with 4 legs.  
  Total legs from 4-legged animals = $15 \times 4 = 60$ legs.

### Step 2: Add the legs together
Total legs on the farm = $20 + 60 = 80$ legs.

### Step 3: Convert legs to pairs
Since 1 pair = 2 legs,  
Total pairs of legs = $\frac{80}{2} = 40$ pairs.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**40 pairs of animal legs** are on the farm.
Let's break this down step by step.

We are told:

- The tower is made up of:
  - 4 **blue** blocks
  - Twice as many **yellow** blocks as blue blocks
  - An unknown number of **red** blocks
- The **total** number of blocks in the tower is **32**

---

### Step 1: Find the number of yellow blocks

We are told there are **twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks**.

- Blue blocks = 4  
- Yellow blocks = 2 × 4 = **8**

---

### Step 2: Add the blue and yellow blocks

- Blue blocks = 4  
- Yellow blocks = 8  
- Total so far = 4 + 8 = **12 blocks**

---

### Step 3: Subtract from total to find red blocks

Total blocks = 32  
Blocks used so far (blue + yellow) = 12  
So, red blocks = 32 − 12 = **20**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

**There are 20 red blocks.**
Let's break the problem down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Understand the journey**

- Elvis drives **west** for **5 hours** at **18 mph**.
- Then he turns around and drives **east** for **8 hours** at **18 mph**.
- We are to find how far he is from his **starting point (house)** after this entire trip.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate distance traveled west**

He travels west for 5 hours at 18 mph:

$$
\text{Distance west} = \text{speed} \times \text{time} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate distance traveled east**

He then travels east for 8 hours at 18 mph:

$$
\text{Distance east} = 18 \, \text{mph} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 144 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Determine net displacement from the house**

Since he first went **west** and then turned around and went **east**, we can treat these as opposite directions. So, we subtract the westward distance from the eastward distance to find how far he is from his starting point.

$$
\text{Net displacement} = \text{Distance east} - \text{Distance west} = 144 \, \text{miles} - 90 \, \text{miles} = 54 \, \text{miles}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{54 \text{ miles}}
$$

Elvis is **54 miles east** of his house.
Let's calculate the value of the boat step by step after each year of depreciation.

### Step 1: Initial Value
Gary bought the boat for:

$$
\$9000
$$

---

### Step 2: Depreciation in Year 1 (30%)

Depreciation amount in Year 1:

$$
30\% \text{ of } \$9000 = 0.30 \times 9000 = \$2700
$$

Value after Year 1:

$$
\$9000 - \$2700 = \$6300
$$

---

### Step 3: Depreciation in Year 2 (30%)

Depreciation amount in Year 2:

$$
30\% \text{ of } \$6300 = 0.30 \times 6300 = \$1890
$$

Value after Year 2:

$$
\$6300 - \$1890 = \$4410
$$

---

### Step 4: Depreciation in Year 3 (20%)

Depreciation amount in Year 3:

$$
20\% \text{ of } \$4410 = 0.20 \times 4410 = \$882
$$

Value after Year 3:

$$
\$4410 - \$882 = \$3528

Let's solve this step by step.

### Given:
- Total number of candies = **232**
- Red candies = **54**
- Orange candies = **twice the number of red candies**
- Yellow candies = **half the number of red candies**
- We are to find the number of **pink candies**

---

### Step 1: Find the number of orange candies

Orange candies = 2 × Red candies  
= 2 × 54 = **108**

---

### Step 2: Find the number of yellow candies

Yellow candies = (1/2) × Red candies  
= (1/2) × 54 = **27**

---

### Step 3: Add up the known candies

---

### Step 4: Subtract from total to find pink candies

Total candies = 232  
Pink candies = Total - (Red + Orange + Yellow)  
= 232 - 189 = **43**

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**There are 43 pink candies.**
Let's break this down step by step:

---

### **1. Cost of the hotel:**

- Helen stayed at the hotel for **3 nights**.
- The cost of **one night** at the hotel is **$80**.

So, total hotel cost =

$$

---

### **2. Cost of the bus trips:**

- Helen took the bus **7 times**.
- Each bus trip costs **10% of the price of one night at the hotel**.

First, find the cost of **one bus trip**:
$$
10\% \text{ of } \$80 = 0.10 \times 80 = \$8
$$

Now, total bus cost =  
$$
7 \times 8 = \$56
$$

---

### **3. Total cost:**

Let's break this down step by step.

### Initial number of cookies:
- **Oatmeal:** 9  
- **Chocolate chip:** 4  
- **Sugar:** 5  

---

### Step 1: Randy eats 3 cookies — one of each flavor.
- Oatmeal: 9 - 1 = **8**  
- Chocolate chip: 4 - 1 = **3**  
- Sugar: 5 - 1 = **4**

---

### Step 2: He eats 2 oatmeal cookies for lunch.
- Oatmeal: 8 - 2 = **6**  
- Chocolate chip: still **3**  
- Sugar: still **4**

---

### Step 3: He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends.
- Oatmeal: still **6**  
- Chocolate chip: still **3**  
- Sugar: 4 - 2 = **2**

---

### Step 4: He bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner.
- Oatmeal: 6 + 4 = **10**  
- Chocolate chip: 3 + 4 = **7**  
- Sugar: 2 + 4 = **6**

---

### Final total number of cookies:
- Oatmeal: **10**  
- Chocolate chip: **7**

**Total = 10 + 7 + 6 = 23 cookies**

---

### ✅ Final Answer: **23 cookies**
Let's break this down step by step:

### Step 1: Total number of toy soldiers
Matthew has **12** unique toy soldiers.

### Step 2: Split the collection
He is selling **half** of them at **$5 per toy**, and the other **half** at **$7 per toy**.

- Half of 12 is:
  $$
  \frac{12}{2} = 6
  $$

So, he sells **6 toys** at **$5 each**, and **6 toys** at **$7 each**.

---

### Step 3: Calculate earnings from each group

- From the first half (6 toys at $5 each):
  $$
  6 \times 5 = 30
  $$

- From the second half (6 toys at $7 each):
  $$
  6 \times 7 = 42
  $$

---

### Step 4: Add both amounts to find total earnings

$$
30 + 42 = 72
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Matthew would earn $72** if he agrees to the offer.
Let's break this down step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog while Nate is away.**

- The dog digs **6 holes per day**.
- Nate is away for **14 days**.

$$
\text{Total holes dug} = 6 \times 14 = 84 \text{ holes}
$$

---

### **Step 2: Determine how many holes are filled each day when Nate returns.**

- Nate fills **9 holes per day**.
- But **every night**, the dog digs **6 new holes**.

So, **each day**, the net change in the number of holes is:

$$
\text{Net change per day} = 9 \text{ (filled)} - 6 \text{ (newly dug)} = 3 \text{ holes filled per day}
$$

---

### **Step 3: Calculate how many days it takes to fill all 84 holes.**

Since Nate fills **3 holes per day**, we divide the total number of holes by the daily net change:

$$
\text{Days needed} = \frac{84}{3} = 28 \text{ days}
$$

---

### **Step 4: Convert days into weeks.**

$$
\text{Weeks needed} = \frac{28}{7} = 4 \text{ weeks}
$$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
$$
\boxed{4 \text{ weeks}}
$$
We are given:

- Norman High School enrolls an average of **4000 students**.
- Butler High School enrolls an average of **3/4 as many students** as Norman High School.

---

### Step 1: Find the enrollment at Butler High School

$$
\text{Butler's enrollment} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4000 = 3000
$$

---

### Step 2: Find the difference in enrollment between Norman and Butler

$$
\text{Difference} = 4000 - 3000 = 1000
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{1000}
$$

The average enrollment at Norman High School is **1000 students greater** than at Butler High School.
We are told that the Adams family has made a total of **7995 cookies**, and they have:

- **2595 rainbow cookies**
- **3075 oatmeal cookies**
- **Some chocolate chip cookies**

We need to find how many **chocolate chip cookies** they have made.

---

### Step 1: Add the number of rainbow and oatmeal cookies

$$
2595 + 3075 = 5670
$$

So, they have made **5670** rainbow and oatmeal cookies combined.

---

### Step 2: Subtract this from the total number of cookies to find the chocolate chip cookies

$$
7995 - 5670 = 2325
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
They have made **2325 chocolate chip cookies**.
We are given a scenario involving Dr. Grumpus and Igor, who was supposed to gather certain lab items but made some mistakes. We need to find out **how many beakers Igor lost**.

---

### Step 1: Understand the requested quantities

Dr. Grumpus asked for:

- **16 test tubes**
- **7 beakers**
- **14 Petri dishes**

---

### Step 2: What Igor actually gathered

Let’s define variables for what Igor actually brought:

- Let $ t $ = number of test tubes Igor actually gathered  
- Let $ b $ = number of beakers Igor actually gathered  
- Let $ p $ = number of Petri dishes Igor actually gathered  

From the problem:

- Igor gathered **half as many test tubes as requested**:  
  $$
  t = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8
  $$

- He gathered **two more than the number of Petri dishes requested**:  
  $$
  p = 14 + 2 = 16
  $$

- He **gathered the correct number of beakers**, but **lost some on the way**. So:
  $$
  b = 7
  $$

But wait — this is not correct. The problem says:

> "he had picked up the correct number of beakers, but lost several on the way to the lab bench."

So Igor **picked up 7 beakers**, but **lost some** on the way. Therefore, the number of beakers he **placed on the bench** is less than 7.

Let’s define:

- $ x $ = number of beakers Igor **lost**
- Then, the number of beakers he **placed on the bench** is $ 7 - x $

---

### Step 3: Total number of items placed on the bench

The total number of items Igor placed on the bench is given as **29**.

So we write the equation:

$$
\text{Test tubes} + \text{Beakers on bench} + \text{Petri dishes} = 29
$$

Substitute known values:

$$
8 + (7 - x) + 16 = 29
$$

Simplify:

$$
8 + 7 - x + 16 = 29 \\
31 - x = 29
$$

Solve for $ x $:

$$
x = 31 - 29 = 2
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{2}
$$

Igor lost **2 beakers**.
Let's solve the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of legs needed
James is putting together **4 tables**, and each table has **4 legs**.

$$
\text{Total legs} = 4 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ legs per table} = 16 \text{ legs}
$$

### Step 2: Determine the number of screws needed
Each leg requires **2 screws**.

$$
\text{Total screws needed} = 16 \text{ legs} \times 2 \text{ screws per leg} = 32 \text{ screws}
$$

### Step 3: Subtract the number of screws used from the total available
James has **40 screws** in total.

$$
\text{Screws left over} = 40 - 32 = 8
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{8}
$$

James will have **8 screws left over**.
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **First basket:**  
   There are **10 eggs** in the first basket.

2. **Second basket:**  
   It says there are **twice as many eggs** in the second basket as in the first.  
   So, we multiply the number of eggs in the first basket by 2:  
   $$
   10 \times 2 = 20
   $$  
   That means the second basket has **20 eggs**.

3. **Total eggs in both baskets:**  
   To find the total, we add the eggs from both baskets:  
   $$
   10 + 20 = 30
   $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **30 eggs** in both baskets together.
Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Find how much **Alexandra** raised  
We are told:

> "Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430."

So, **Alexandra** raises **$430**.

---

### Step 2: Find how much **Kim** raised  
Kim raises **$320 more** than Alexandra:

$$
\text{Kim} = \text{Alexandra} + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750
$$

So, **Kim raises $750**.

---

### Step 3: Find how much **Sarah** raised  
We are told:

> "Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300."

So, **Sarah** raises **$300**.

---

### Step 4: Find how much **Maryam** raised  
Maryam raises **$400 more** than Sarah:

$$
\text{Maryam} = \text{Sarah} + 400 = 300 + 400 = 700
$$

So, **Maryam raises $700**.

---

### Step 5: Add up all the amounts to find the total

$$
\text{Total} = \text{Kim} + \text{Alexandra} + \text{Sarah} + \text{Maryam}
$$

$$
\text{Total} = 750 + 430 + 300 + 700 = 2180
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{2180}
$$

They all raised **$2180** in total.
We are given the following information:

- **Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa.**
- **Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron did.**
- **Vanessa ran 4 miles.**
- **Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes.**

We are asked: **How long did Vanessa take to complete her part?**

---

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between speed and distance

Let’s define:

- Let $ v $ be Vanessa's running speed (in miles per minute).
- Then Aaron's speed is $ 2v $, since he runs **twice as fast** as Vanessa.

Now, we're told that **Vanessa ran 4 miles**, so we can find how long it took her using the formula:

$$
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
$$

So for Vanessa:
$$
\text{Time}_{\text{Vanessa}} = \frac{4}{v}
$$

That’s the time we want to find — but we don’t know $ v $ yet.

---

### Step 2: Use Aaron’s data to find $ v $

We are told that **Aaron completed his part of the race in 16 minutes**, and he runs **twice as fast as Vanessa**.

Let’s find out how many miles Aaron ran.

From the problem:

> "Vanessa was able to run twice as far as Aaron did."

So:

$$
\text{Distance}_{\text{Vanessa}} = 2 \times \text{Distance}_{\text{Aaron}}
$$

Given that Vanessa ran 4 miles:

$$
4 = 2 \times \text{Distance}_{\text{Aaron}} \Rightarrow \text{Distance}_{\text{Aaron}} = 2 \text{ miles}
$$

Now, we can use Aaron’s time and distance to find his speed:

$$
\text{Speed}_{\text{Aaron}} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{2}{16} = \frac{1}{8} \text{ miles per minute}
$$

But we were told that **Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa**, so:

$$
\text{Speed}_{\text{Aaron}} = 2 \times \text{Speed}_{\text{Vanessa}} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{8} = 2v \Rightarrow v = \frac{1}{16} \text{ miles per minute}
$$

---

### Step 3: Find the time Vanessa took

Now that we know:

- $ v = \frac{1}{16} $ miles per minute
- Distance = 4 miles

$$
\text{Time}_{\text{Vanessa}} = \frac{4}{v} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{16}} = 4 \times 16 = 64 \text{ minutes}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{64} \text{ minutes}
$$

Vanessa took **64 minutes** to complete her part of the race.
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Understand the requirement:**
The caretaker needs **3 feet of line for every foot of dock**.

### 2. **Current dock length:**
There is currently **200 feet of dock**.

### 3. **Calculate total line needed:**
Since he needs **3 feet of line per foot of dock**, we multiply:

$$
200 \text{ feet of dock} \times 3 = 600 \text{ feet of line}
$$

### 4. **Line he already has:**
He already has **6 feet of new line**.

### 5. **Calculate how much more line he needs to buy:**

$$
600 \text{ feet (total needed)} - 6 \text{ feet (already has)} = 594 \text{ feet}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**He needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.**
Let's break this down step by step:

### 1. **Number of reservations per night:**
Tom's restaurant gets **6 reservations a night**.

### 2. **Items ordered per reservation:**
- **2 meals** at **$5 each**:  
  $ 2 \times 5 = \$10 $
- **1 bottle of wine** at **$5**:  
  $ \$5 $

### 3. **Total per reservation:**
$$
\$10 + \$5 = \$15 \text{ per reservation}
$$

### 4. **Total per night:**
$$
6 \text{ reservations} \times \$15 = \$90 \text{ per night}
$$

### 5. **Number of nights open per week:**
They are open **2 days a week**.

### 6. **Total weekly revenue:**
$$
\$90 \text{ per night} \times 2 \text{ nights} = \$180
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Tom's restaurant makes \$180 a week.**
Let's solve this step by step.

---

### **Step 1: Find the cost price per watermelon**

The vendor bought **50 watermelons** for **$80**.

So, the **cost price (CP)** of one watermelon is:

$$
\text{CP per watermelon} = \frac{80}{50} = 1.6
$$

So, each watermelon cost **$1.60**.

---

### **Step 2: Calculate the selling price per watermelon with a 25% profit**

He made a **25% profit** on the cost price.

To find the selling price (SP), we calculate:

$$
\text{SP} = \text{CP} + (\text{Profit \%} \times \text{CP}) = 1.6 + (0.25 \times 1.6)
$$

$$
\text{SP} = 1.6 + 0.4 = 2.0
$$

---

### **Final Answer:**

$$
\boxed{\$2.00}
$$

So, **each watermelon was sold for $2.00**.
Let's solve this step by step.

### Step 1: Determine Dora's current age

We're told:
- Dora will turn **12 in 3 years**.

So, **Dora is currently**:

$$
12 - 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### Step 2: Determine James's current age

We're told:
- James is **twice as old as Dora**, who is **9 years old** now.

So, James is:

$$
2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### Step 3: Determine John's current age

We're told:
- John had a son **James when he was 19**.

Since James is **18 years old now**, that means:

$$
\text{John's current age} = 19 + 18 = 37 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### Step 4: Determine the youngest son's current age

We're told:
- The **youngest son was born when John was 32**.

So, since John is currently **37**, the youngest son is:

$$
37 - 32 = 5 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### Step 5: How old will the youngest son be in 3 years?

$$
5 + 3 = 8 \text{ years old}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

$$
\boxed{8}
$$
We are given:

- **Ana** takes **3 minutes per orange**
- **Jane** takes **4 minutes per orange**
- They both start peeling oranges at the **same time**
- We want to know how many **more oranges** Ana will have peeled than Jane after **1 hour (60 minutes)**

---

### Step 1: Calculate how many oranges each can peel in 60 minutes

#### For Ana:
- Time per orange = 3 minutes
- Number of oranges she can peel in 60 minutes:
  $$
  \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ oranges}
  $$

#### For Jane:
- Time per orange = 4 minutes
- Number of oranges she can peel in 60 minutes:
  $$
  \frac{60}{4} = 15 \text{ oranges}
  $$

---

### Step 2: Find the difference in the number of oranges peeled

$$
\text{Difference} = 20 - 15 = \boxed{5}
$$

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane after an hour.**
Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Original cost of the radiator**: $400  
2. **Discount at the junk shop**: 80% off  
   - So Mark pays **20%** of the original price:  
     $$
     400 \times 0.20 = 80
     $$  
   - So, he pays **$80** for the radiator.

3. **Mechanic installation cost**:  
   - 3 hours at $50 per hour:  
     $$
     3 \times 50 = 150
     $$

4. **Total cost**:  
   - Radiator cost + Installation cost:  
     $$
     80 + 150 = 230
     $$

### ✅ Final Answer: **$230**
We are told:

- Farmer Brown has **20 animals** in total.
- All animals are either **chickens** or **cows**.
- The total number of **legs** is **70**.

Let’s define:

- Let $ c $ be the number of **chickens**.
- Let $ w $ be the number of **cows**.

### Step 1: Set up equations

We know two things:

1. Total number of animals:
   $$
   c + w = 20
   $$

2. Total number of legs:
   - Chickens have **2 legs**
   - Cows have **4 legs**
   $$
   2c + 4w = 70
   $$

### Step 2: Solve the system of equations

From the first equation:
$$
c = 20 - w
$$

Substitute into the second equation:
$$
2(20 - w) + 4w = 70
$$

Simplify:
$$
40 - 2w + 4w = 70
$$
$$
40 + 2w = 70
$$
$$
2w = 30
$$
$$
w = 15
$$

Now substitute back to find $ c $:
$$
c = 20 - w = 20 - 15 = 5
$$

### ✅ Final Answer:
$$
\boxed{5}
$$

There are **5 chickens** on the farm.
Let's break the problem down step by step:

---

### **Step 1: Total number of people**
- Henry + 3 friends = **4 people** in total.

---

### **Step 2: Total number of pizza slices**
- There are **7 pizzas**.
- Each pizza is cut into **8 slices**.
- So, total slices =  
  $$
  7 \text{ pizzas} \times 8 \text{ slices per pizza} = 56 \text{ slices}
  $$

---

### **Step 3: Divide slices equally among 4 people**
- To find how many slices each person gets:
  $$
  \frac{56 \text{ slices}}{4 \text{ people}} = 14 \text{ slices per person}
  $$

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**
Each person can have **14 slices**.
